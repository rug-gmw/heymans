       "- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional states.\n",
       "- It is important in end-of-life decisions because:\n",
       "  1. People often underestimate their ability to adapt to difficult circumstances\n",

       "The distinction between \"underestimation\" and \"treating as impossibilities\" (as specified in the answer key) appears to be overly strict. Several students indicated that extremely low probabilities are \"underestimated,\" which is essentially correct - treating something as impossible is arguably the ultimate form of underestimation.

       "Specifically, the answer key's first point about \"financial vs. non-financial values\" is somewhat oversimplified. While it's true that expected utility theory can handle non-financial values, the more fundamental distinction is that expected value theory assumes risk neutrality and focuses on mathematical expectations, while expected utility theory incorporates subjective preferences and utilities.\n",
       "\n",
       "I recommend updating the answer key to:\n",

       "- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Evaluation\n",
       "\n",
       "After reviewing the question, answer key, and incorrect student responses, I notice that many students seem to be consistently mixing up various decision-making theories and models that may have been covered elsewhere in the course, but weren't part of the specific four models mentioned in this lecture.\n",
       "\n",
       "However, I don't see any evidence that students were unfairly penalized due to problems with the answer key. The answer key clearly specifies:\n",
       "1. Expected value theory (with financial outcomes and probabilities)\n",
       "2. Expected utility theory (similar but with subjective utilities)\n",

       "After reviewing the question, answer key, and incorrect student responses, I believe the answer key should be expanded. While the current key captures an essential mechanism of how learning contributes to hindsight bias (the inability to ignore new information when making retrospective judgments), the student responses reveal some additional valid points about the relationship between learning and hindsight bias.\n",

       "\n",
       "- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge.\n",
       "- Learning provides additional causal understanding and explanatory frameworks that make past outcomes seem more predictable than they actually were at the time.\n",
       "- As people acquire new knowledge, they tend to overestimate their ability to have anticipated outcomes based on the information that was actually available at the time.\n",
       "\n",
       "Rationale: The student responses demonstrate understanding of important aspects of how learning contributes to hindsight bias, even if they missed the specific mechanism highlighted in the original answer key. The expanded answer key would better capture the multiple ways in which learning influences hindsight bias while still maintaining the core concept from the original key.\n",
       "\n",
       "This would allow for partial credit for responses that correctly identify some, but not all, of the mechanisms through which learning contributes to hindsight bias.\n",
