## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidtâ€™s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

The social-intuitionist model suggests that individuals typically rely on their intuition or emotions to form moral judgments initially, representing System 1 thinking. System 1 involves quick, automatic decisions, whereas System 2 involves slower, more thoughtful and intentional reasoning.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 thinking involves intuition/emotions in moral judgment formation, matching the answer key's requirement.
- Correct: The student accurately describes System 2 as involving slower, more thoughtful and intentional reasoning, which aligns with the answer key's definition of reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Incorrect: While the student implies System 1 operates first ('initially'), they do not explicitly state that System 1 thinking is more dominant than System 2 thinking according to Haidt's model.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

This example demonstrates the representativeness heuristic, which means that people often classify others into specific groups based on how closely they match the typical traits of those groups.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process in this scenario.
- Correct: The student provides an accurate explanation of the representativeness heuristic, describing how people classify others based on how closely they match typical traits of groups, which aligns with the answer key's explanation about estimating likelihood based on resemblance to stereotypes.

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring involves making a judgment about the value of something by relying on an initial piece of information (the anchor). The primacy effect describes how individuals are heavily impacted by the first information they encounter about a person or subject. Both concepts relate to the influence of early or initial information.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as relying on an initial piece of information when making judgments, which captures the essence of taking the first piece of information as a starting point.
- Incorrect: The student describes the primacy effect as being 'heavily impacted' by first information, but doesn't specifically mention the memory aspect - that it's about better remembering the first piece of information.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both concepts relate to the influence of early/initial information, demonstrating understanding of their shared overreliance on first information.

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency of individuals to give greater importance to losses than to gains, while risk aversion describes the preference for safer, more guaranteed options due to a reluctance to take risks.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves giving greater importance to losses than to gains, which matches the answer key's definition of weighing losses more heavily than gains.
- Correct: The student accurately describes risk aversion as preferring safer, more guaranteed options due to reluctance to take risks, which aligns with the answer key's definition of preferring certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 1.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias refers to the tendency of individuals to exaggerate both the duration and intensity of their emotional reactions to future events. For example, someone may steer clear of a breakup, expecting to experience more severe and prolonged sadness than what is likely to occur.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as the tendency to exaggerate emotional reactions to future events, mentioning both intensity and duration which captures the essence of overestimating impact.
- Correct: The student provides a clear example showing how impact bias prevents breakups by explaining that people avoid breaking up because they expect more severe and prolonged sadness than would actually occur.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves predicting how we think a future event will impact our emotions. These predictions are not always accurate and can be influenced by various factors, such as impact bias and the disability paradox. Therefore, it is crucial to take affective forecasting into account when making end-of-life decisions to reduce the chances of regret and make more informed choices.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines affective forecasting as predicting how future events will impact our emotions, which aligns with the answer key's definition of predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Incorrect: While the student mentions the importance of considering affective forecasting in end-of-life decisions, they don't specifically address the key point about healthy people predicting they'll prefer to die when sick, but then changing their preference when actually sick.

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

People often downplay the likelihood of low probabilities. Very small probabilities are frequently perceived as impossible, and low probabilities are considered less likely than they truly are.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student states that low probabilities are 'considered less likely than they truly are,' which indicates underestimation. However, the answer key states that merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that very small probabilities are 'frequently perceived as impossible,' which aligns with the answer key's point about extremely low probabilities being interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 0.5

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Losses represent negative utility, whereas gains represent positive utility, with people tending to favor gains much more strongly than they dislike losses.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that people favor gains more strongly than they dislike losses, which is the opposite of loss aversion. Loss aversion means losses are weighted more heavily than equivalent gains, not that gains are favored more strongly.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory proposes that individuals make decisions by considering the outcome with the highest overall value. Expected utility theory expands on this idea by incorporating the concept of utility, meaning that the value of each outcome varies according to the context. While expected value theory is purely objective, expected utility theory allows for some personal judgment.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions that expected utility theory incorporates 'utility' and varies by context, but does not clearly distinguish that expected value theory deals only with financial values while expected utility theory deals with both financial and non-financial values.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected utility theory allows for 'personal judgment' which relates to risk aversion and individual preferences, while expected value theory is 'purely objective' without considering heuristics and biases.

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesnâ€™t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected value theory proposes that individuals make choices based on the total value of a result. Expected utility theory, on the other hand, argues that decisions are made according to the overall positive or negative utility of an outcome, which can vary depending on the context. Multiattribute utility theory incorporates multiple factors across different dimensions into the decision-making process using a mathematical approach. Prospect theory builds upon expected utility theory by accounting for the mental shortcuts and mistakes people often make when making decisions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as being based on the total value of results, which aligns with the normative model concept and financial outcomes mentioned in the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes expected utility theory as focusing on utility rather than just financial value, and mentions context dependency which relates to subjective utility from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that multiattribute utility theory involves multiple factors/dimensions and uses a mathematical approach, which corresponds to the multiple attributes with utilities and weights from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes prospect theory as building on expected utility theory while accounting for mental shortcuts and mistakes, which aligns with the descriptive/behavioral model that considers heuristics and biases.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease peopleâ€™s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency of individuals to place more emphasis on losses than on equivalent gains. People tend to avoid risk when choices are presented as potential gains, but they are more likely to take risks when choices are presented as potential losses.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people become more willing to take risks when choices are framed as potential losses, which directly addresses how loss aversion can decrease risk aversion and make people risk-seeking to avoid losses.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves the process by which individuals learn to connect related information. In classical conditioning, a person comes to recognize that a neutral stimulus predicts the arrival of another, typically more important, stimulus. In operant conditioning, learning occurs through linking actions with consequences such as rewards or punishments.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as a learning process involving connections/associations, which aligns with the key concept of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as learning that a neutral stimulus predicts another stimulus, which captures the essence of learning associations when things happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning through linking actions with consequences like rewards or punishments, which matches the answer key definition.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation describes the mistaken belief that one event directly causes another. Illusory correlation involves the incorrect assumption that two variables are linked based on perceived patterns. It is important to note that causation and correlation are not always present together.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that illusory causation involves mistakenly believing one event causes another (which aligns with incorrectly interpreting correlation as causation) and that illusory correlation involves incorrectly assuming variables are linked when they're not actually correlated. The core distinction between the two concepts is properly understood.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to â€˜properlyâ€™ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

Understanding the Dutch healthcare system is a schema because it consists of fundamental knowledge about a specific concept or phenomenon. In contrast, knowing how to act at a birthday party is a script, as it entails understanding the usual sequence of events in that situation.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the Dutch healthcare system as a schema and provides an appropriate explanation that it involves fundamental knowledge about a concept, which aligns with the answer key's description of schemas as knowledge and relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies birthday party behavior as a script and explains it involves understanding sequences of events in a situation, which corresponds well with the answer key's description of scripts as social schemas describing behavior in specific situations.

Score: 1.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

Behaviorists took an intentional perspective by evaluating the motives and reasons for behavior to draw conclusions about the mind.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies behaviorists as adopting the intentional stance, when they actually adopted the physical stance. Additionally, the student mischaracterizes behaviorism by suggesting behaviorists evaluated motives and reasons to draw conclusions about the mind, when behaviorists explicitly rejected studying the mind and focused solely on observable stimulus-response relationships.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

Evolutionary psychologists take a design perspective, focusing on explaining why a particular behavior was advantageous for a species' evolution and what evolutionary purpose it was intended to serve.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance and provides an accurate explanation that they focus on the function and evolutionary purpose of behaviors, which aligns with the answer key's emphasis on considering psychological processes in terms of their function.

Score: 1.0

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Distinctiveness indicates if a response or effect is usually triggered by a particular stimulus. Consistency refers to the regular occurrence of a response or effect when exposed to the same stimulus. Contiguity in time and space means that the response or effect and the stimulus happen close to each other both temporally and spatially. Similarity of cause and effect pertains to whether the response or effect shares characteristics with the proposed cause. Temporal order signifies that the effect occurs after the suggested cause.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies distinctiveness and explains it as a response being triggered by a particular stimulus, which aligns with the answer key's concept of specificity.
- Correct: The student accurately describes consistency as regular occurrence of a response when exposed to the same stimulus, matching the answer key's definition.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention plausibility as one of the five heuristics, instead listing temporal order as the fifth heuristic.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies contiguity in time and space and provides an accurate explanation that matches the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies similarity of cause and effect and explains it as sharing characteristics between cause and effect, which aligns with the answer key.

Score: 0.8

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Engaging in conversations on social media is simple, which increases the exposure of these discussions and contributes to the availability heuristic. This heuristic means that individuals assess events based on how quickly and easily information about them comes to mind. Additionally, the representativeness heuristic influences this process, as people observe numerous angry comments or reactions and assume these reflect the broader group of morally outraged individuals, despite the fact that posting a comment or an angry reaction is quite easy.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student does not mention the negativity bias, which is a key component of the answer. Instead, they focus on the ease of social media engagement without addressing our tendency to seek out or weight negative information more heavily.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies and explains the availability heuristic, noting that people assess events based on how easily examples come to mind, which aligns with the answer key's definition.
- Incorrect: The student does not explain the connection between the two biases as required by the answer key. They mention representativeness heuristic instead of negativity bias and fail to show how negativity bias feeds into availability heuristic to cause overestimation of moral outrage.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

Framework theories consist of everyday understandings about particular fields like psychology, biology, or physics, and individuals occasionally apply this knowledge inappropriately to other areas, leading to phenomena like magical contagion, where objects are thought to be 'contaminated.'

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that magical contagion involves inappropriately applying biological concepts (contamination) to social/psychological domains, demonstrating understanding of how framework theories from one domain can be misapplied to another.

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A conspiracy theory is viewed as delusional based on cultural standards. What is seen as a delusional conspiracy theory in one culture may be regarded as entirely legitimate in another.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student focuses on cultural relativism but misses the key distinction from the answer key. The answer key specifies that delusional conspiracy theories are both 'irrational beliefs' and 'not commonly accepted,' while the student only addresses cultural acceptance without mentioning the irrationality criterion.

Score: 0.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

Illusion of control: When faced with uncertainty about the world, people may turn to conspiracy theories to gain a sense of control. Conspiracy thinking is also linked to uncritical thinking and a tendency to favor simpler decision-making processes. Additionally, being male is associated with a higher likelihood of endorsing conspiracy beliefs.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student mentions 'uncritical thinking and a tendency to favor simpler decision-making processes' which aligns with 'having a low level of analytical thinking' and 'believing in simple explanations for complex events' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'being male is associated with a higher likelihood of endorsing conspiracy beliefs' which matches 'being a man' from the answer key.
- Incorrect: While 'illusion of control' is a relevant psychological concept, it doesn't directly match any of the specific factors listed in the answer key such as seeing patterns in randomness, believing paranormal phenomena, or attributing agency where it doesn't exist.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you donâ€™t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Individuals typically learn best when they receive feedback on their decisions. When students actively retrieve incorrect information about the subject, they may fall prey to the availability heuristic during exams, recalling that information simply because they have considered it frequently.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions the availability heuristic, which is about judging probability based on ease of recall, but this doesn't address the specific mechanism by which incorrect answers interfere with learning. The answer key requires explanation of source amnesia (forgetting that an answer was incorrect), proactive interference (initial incorrect answers interfering with later correct ones), or the continued-influence effect. The availability heuristic is a different cognitive bias that doesn't capture how incorrect answers specifically interfere with learning the correct information.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

Politicians may also utilize framing effects to present their statements in a more appealing way.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions framing effects, which is a different psychological concept about how information is presented rather than the specific mechanism that makes repeated messages more attractive through familiarity (mere exposure effect) or perceived truthfulness (illusory-truth effect).

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Yes. They are probably affected by projection bias and the impact of transfer effects.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that major depressive disorder makes people less accurate at predictions, when research shows depressed individuals are actually more accurate due to reduced optimism bias. The mention of projection bias and transfer effects doesn't address the core finding about depressive realism.

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

When sensory information becomes less reliable, our existing prior beliefs have a greater influence on our perception compared to when the sensory information is clearer or more distinct.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when sensory information becomes less reliable, prior beliefs have greater influence on perception, which directly matches the key concept from the answer key.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You donâ€™t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other peopleâ€™s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

The pre-conventional stage indicates that children understand moral choices based on the rewards and punishments imposed by an authority figure. The conventional stage implies that individuals adopt moral behavior to maintain social order and fairness. The post-conventional stage involves acting morally based on deeper principles of right and wrong, which may align with or challenge existing laws.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the pre-conventional level as understanding moral choices based on rewards and punishments from authority figures, which aligns with the answer key's description of obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as adopting moral behavior to maintain social order and fairness, which corresponds to the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the post-conventional level as acting morally based on deeper principles of right and wrong that may challenge existing laws, which matches the answer key's description of focusing on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

The causal model of past events proposes that hindsight bias occurs because individuals readily create a cause-and-effect link after learning the outcome of an event.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes what a causal model does rather than defining what it is. They don't mention that it's a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that causal models contribute to hindsight bias by creating cause-and-effect links after learning outcomes, which aligns with the concept that events seem more inevitable than they were.

Score: 0.5

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Hindsight bias can be understood as a consequence of an adaptive learning mechanism. Initially, individuals assess probability cues and their values prior to predicting an outcome. After the outcome is known, they tend to revise their memories or beliefs, which may lead to hindsight bias.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes hindsight bias as resulting from memory revision after learning outcomes, but fails to identify the key mechanism: that newly learned information inevitably influences our ability to accurately recall past likelihood judgments, making it impossible to ignore what we now know when trying to remember what we thought before.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing is a decision-making approach where individuals aim to select the optimal option to achieve the greatest advantages. Those with high levels of neuroticism are more likely to use this style. Satisficing, on the other hand, involves choosing an option that meets acceptable standards rather than seeking the perfect solution.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as aiming to select the optimal option to achieve the greatest advantages, which aligns with 'trying to make the best choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly describes satisficing as choosing an option that meets acceptable standards rather than seeking perfection, which matches 'making a good-enough choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that those with high levels of neuroticism are more likely to use the maximizing style, which matches the answer key's statement about neurotic individuals adopting maximizing decision style.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

I would try to make the content more engaging by incorporating interactive tools like Quizlets and Slimstampen instead of relying only on readings such as book chapters and articles. This approach could enhance many students' performance by providing them with consistent, accurate feedback on their understanding of the material.
