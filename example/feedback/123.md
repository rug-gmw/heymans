## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

According to the social-intuitionist model, moral reasoning is primarily influenced by emotions and instinct rather than logical thinking. Thus, System 1, which operates quickly, efficiently, and relies on feelings, plays a more prominent role in forming moral judgments. Typically, people engage in logical reasoning only after making their initial judgment. Consequently, System 2, which handles slower, deliberate, and more analytical thought, is less prominent and acts as a secondary process.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 involves emotions and instinct ('relies on feelings'), which aligns with the answer key's description of System 1 as intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student correctly describes System 2 as 'slower, deliberate, and more analytical thought' and mentions 'logical reasoning,' which corresponds to the answer key's definition of System 2 as reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student clearly states that 'System 1...plays a more prominent role' and that 'System 2...is less prominent,' demonstrating understanding that System 1 (intuition/emotion) is dominant over System 2 (reasoning).

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

Representativeness bias occurs when we categorize someone as part of a group based on how closely they match the typical characteristics of that group. At the same time, we ignore the overall prevalence or likelihood of being in that group. For instance, if a person appears to fit the image of a fashion model, we might assume they are one, without taking into account how rare it is to actually encounter a fashion model.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic (referred to as 'representativeness bias') as the underlying cognitive process in this scenario.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that the representativeness heuristic involves estimating category membership based on how well someone matches typical characteristics or stereotypes of that category, which aligns with the answer key's explanation.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

In anchoring, individuals respond by relying on the initial number given in the question. This number acts as a reference point, influencing their estimates. They then modify their answer in a certain direction but tend to make insufficient adjustments. This can lead to a primacy effect, where the first information encountered has a much stronger impact on decisions than later details. Both concepts share the idea that the initial information is given greater importance than subsequent information.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as relying on initial information as a reference point, which aligns with the answer key's definition of taking the first piece of information as the starting point.
- Incorrect: The student describes the primacy effect as first information having stronger impact on decisions, but the answer key specifically defines it as the tendency to better remember the first piece of information, which is about memory rather than decision impact.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both concepts share the overreliance on initial/first information, which matches the answer key's point about overreliance on the first piece of information.

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion relates to the perceived value of gains or losses, while risk aversion involves assessing the likelihood of specific outcomes, whether positive or negative.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions that loss aversion relates to 'perceived value of gains or losses' but fails to capture the key concept that losses are weighted more heavily than equivalent gains. The answer is too vague and doesn't demonstrate understanding of the asymmetry between losses and gains.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly describes risk aversion as 'assessing the likelihood of specific outcomes' which confuses risk assessment with risk preference. Risk aversion is about preferring certainty over uncertainty, not about evaluating probabilities of outcomes.

Score: 0.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias involves downplaying the extent to which an event influences us while overestimating our ability to manage it. People often stay in familiar relationships out of routine and a sense of security. However, feelings of unhappiness and dissatisfaction are overlooked because we believe we have control and can end the relationship whenever we choose. As a result, the decision to break up is postponed, with the false assumption that we are not deeply affected.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly defines impact bias as 'downplaying the extent to which an event influences us while overestimating our ability to manage it.' The correct definition is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Incorrect: The student's explanation focuses on staying in relationships due to routine and overestimating control, rather than the correct mechanism where impact bias prevents breakups because people overestimate how bad the breakup will make them feel.

Score: 0.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves anticipating our future emotions, including their duration and intensity. People tend to overestimate how strongly they will feel emotions in the future, though they can accurately predict whether those emotions will be positive or negative. For example, individuals might assume that in old age their health and life quality will be much worse than it truly is, and they may doubt their ability to accurately assess their own condition at that time. As a result, they might make decisions in advance for their future selves, such as choosing euthanasia or determining their care. Yet, when they actually reach old age and experience the situation firsthand, they often perceive it differently—the expected negative feelings are not as severe as anticipated, which can lead to changed choices.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines affective forecasting as anticipating future emotions, which aligns with the answer key's definition of predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Correct: The student accurately explains the core concept that healthy people may make advance decisions (like choosing euthanasia) based on predicted future preferences, but when they actually experience the situation, their actual preferences may differ from what they predicted.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

In general, people tend to underestimate small probabilities. When these probabilities are very tiny, they are often seen as virtually impossible, influencing people's behavior accordingly. Yet, if the probabilities are just somewhat low, individuals may take a risk on them, especially if they feel secure about the future and are responding to a situation framed around potential losses.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student states that people 'underestimate small probabilities' in general, which contradicts the answer key that merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that extremely low probabilities are 'seen as virtually impossible,' which aligns with the answer key's point about them being interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 0.5

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency of individuals to consider losses as significantly more impactful than equivalent gains, leading them to prioritize avoiding losses over acquiring gains.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly describes loss aversion as a behavioral tendency where losses are more impactful than equivalent gains, but fails to express this specifically in terms of utility/value function as required. The answer lacks the technical explanation that negative utilities are weighted more heavily or that the value function is steeper for losses than gains.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

In expected value theory, the value is considered objective and is expected to influence most individuals similarly. In contrast, expected utility theory views value as subjective, shaped by personal history, belongings, and present desires. Therefore, utility theory recognizes that people may perceive the same result differently and vary in their motivation to respond to it.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student discusses subjective vs objective values but doesn't mention the key distinction that expected value theory deals only with financial values while expected utility theory deals with both financial and non-financial values.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected utility theory accounts for individual differences and subjective perceptions, which relates to risk aversion and personal biases, while expected value theory treats decisions more objectively without considering these factors.

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

The first model is the rational agent model, where individuals aim to maximize their benefits and consistently act logically. The second model, prospect theory, acknowledges that people respond differently to gains and losses and perceive past, present, and future in distinct ways. The third model, expected value theory, suggests that people make decisions based on the objective worth of certain items or outcomes (like salary, price, or bets). In contrast, the fourth model, expected utility theory, views value as subjective, focusing on personal utility—how something fulfills our needs or how we can utilize it.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions 'rational agent model' instead of expected value theory. While related concepts, this doesn't match the specific model from the answer key which focuses on choosing between options with probabilistic financial outcomes.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies prospect theory and captures its key descriptive nature by mentioning that people respond differently to gains and losses, which aligns with the behavioral/descriptive aspects mentioned in the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory and explains it focuses on objective worth of outcomes, which aligns with the answer key's description of financial outcomes with probabilities.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected utility theory and explains the subjective nature of utility and personal fulfillment, which matches the answer key's emphasis on subjective utility beyond just financial outcomes.

Score: 0.75

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Individuals prefer certainty and avoid risk when outcomes are framed as gains. However, when outcomes are presented as losses, they are more likely to take risks and gamble. Thus, in an effort to prevent losses, people generally become more willing to take risks and show less aversion to risk.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly explains that loss aversion decreases risk aversion when people face potential losses. They accurately describe that people become risk-seeking in the loss domain to avoid losses, which directly addresses how loss aversion affects the degree of risk aversion.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning is a form of learning where a stimulus becomes linked to a response. In classical conditioning, when a stimulus consistently occurs together with a response, we come to anticipate that response whenever the conditioned stimulus is present. In operant conditioning, the response is our behavior, which we learn based on previous rewards or punishments related to that behavior in response to a stimulus—behaviors that are rewarded tend to be repeated, while those that are punished are less likely to continue.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as a form of learning involving associations, though they describe it as linking stimulus to response rather than learning through covariation. The core concept of associative learning is captured.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as learning when stimuli consistently occur together, leading to anticipation of responses. This captures the essence of learning associations through temporal and spatial covariation.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning behaviors based on rewards and punishments, noting that rewarded behaviors increase while punished behaviors decrease. This demonstrates understanding that actions cause consequences.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory correlation occurs when we exaggerate the frequency or connection between certain events because we notice the times they happen together more. This phenomenon arises from our tendency to create a coherent story and interpret the sequence of events, rather than simply giving more attention to specific occurrences.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student only defines illusory correlation and does not address illusory causation at all. Additionally, their definition of illusory correlation focuses on exaggerating frequency rather than perceiving correlation where none exists, and they don't distinguish it from illusory causation as required by the question.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

A schema is a mental structure that organizes events, conversations, or locations that typically occur together, leading us to anticipate their connection—such as the schema of high school. A script, on the other hand, is more detailed and pertains to specific situations where actions generally occur in a predictable sequence, like what usually happens at a restaurant. Therefore, grasping the Dutch healthcare system involves a schema, whereas understanding proper behavior at a birthday party relies on following a script.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that understanding the Dutch healthcare system is a schema and provides a reasonable explanation that schemas are mental structures that organize knowledge about how things are typically connected or organized.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script and provides an accurate explanation that scripts involve predictable sequences of actions in specific situations.

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

Behaviorists embraced the social level of analysis because, unlike internal mental states, behavior is directly observable and influences the behavior of others. As a result, it belongs to the social or behavioral sphere.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies behaviorists as adopting a 'social level of analysis' rather than the physical stance. While the student correctly notes that behaviorists focused on observable behavior, they misunderstand Dennett's stances - behaviorists adopted the physical stance because they focused on stimulus-response mechanisms as physical processes, not social interactions.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

Evolutionary psychologists focus on the social (or moral) level of analysis because it examines the network of human interactions and how specific behaviors are perceived and influence others.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the stance as 'social (or moral) level of analysis' rather than the design stance. While they mention examining behaviors and interactions, they fail to recognize that evolutionary psychology adopts the design stance by focusing on the function and purpose of psychological processes in evolutionary terms, not primarily on social networks or moral perceptions.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Representativeness heuristic refers to the tendency to consider event B more probably caused by event A if B resembles something associated with A. Covariation examines whether events A and B consistently happen simultaneously. Plausibility assesses the likelihood that A is the cause of B.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: Student mentions representativeness heuristic which relates to similarity, but does not identify distinctness/specificity as a separate heuristic for judging causation.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies covariation/consistency as examining whether events A and B consistently happen together, which matches the consistency heuristic.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies plausibility as assessing the likelihood that A causes B, which matches the plausibility heuristic from the answer key.
- Incorrect: Student does not mention contiguity in time and space as a heuristic for judging causation.
- Correct: Student mentions representativeness heuristic describing resemblance between B and something associated with A, which captures the essence of similarity in cause and effect.

Score: 0.6

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Negativity bias means that negative information, messages, or images tend to be remembered better and draw more attention than positive ones. As a result, when we focus more on angry or upset posts on social media, we mistakenly believe that there are more outraged people than actually exist. The representativeness heuristic causes us to assume that the small sample of people we see online reflects the entire population, which isn’t accurate. When we encounter moral outrage on social media, we incorrectly think it occurs in the same proportion in the real world. In truth, individuals with certain characteristics and motivations are more likely to spend time on social media, so we only observe a narrow and unrepresentative group.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias and explains that it causes us to focus more on negative/angry content, leading to overestimation of moral outrage.
- Incorrect: The student identifies representativeness heuristic instead of availability heuristic. While representativeness heuristic is related, the answer key specifically requires availability heuristic - the tendency to estimate frequency based on ease of recall.
- Incorrect: The student does not explain the mechanism connecting negativity bias and availability heuristic. Instead, they focus on sampling bias and unrepresentative populations, missing the key connection about how negativity bias increases memorable examples which availability heuristic then uses for frequency estimation.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

Framework theories propose that individuals naturally function within various domains such as physics, biology, or psychology, each governed by its own set of principles. Occasionally, people mistakenly transfer rules from one domain to another, leading to beliefs like thinking that the negative mental states of a disliked person possess a physical quality capable of contaminating their possessions. This reflects the incorrect application of physical laws related to mechanics and materials to the psychological realm.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly identifies framework theories and cross-domain transfer, but incorrectly identifies the source domain as physics/mechanics rather than biology. The answer key specifically requires identifying that biological contagion concepts are being misapplied to the social/psychological domain.

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

Delusional conspiracies consist of highly improbable schemes, plans, and entities that secretly control everything behind the scenes. In contrast, non-delusional conspiracies challenge the status quo but do so with a basis in reality.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's answer focuses on probability and reality basis but misses the key distinction from the answer key: that delusional conspiracy theories are defined by being both irrational beliefs AND not commonly accepted. The student doesn't mention the social acceptance criterion that differentiates delusional from non-delusional conspiracy theories.

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

Belief in conspiracy theories is associated with elevated levels of narcissism, dark triad traits, and lower intelligence.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies narcissism as a personality factor contributing to conspiratorial thinking, which directly matches the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies lower intelligence as a cognitive factor contributing to conspiratorial thinking, which matches the answer key's mention of 'having a low level of intelligence.'
- Correct: While 'dark triad traits' is not explicitly listed in the answer key, it encompasses narcissism (which is listed) and represents a valid psychological framework for personality factors in conspiratorial thinking, demonstrating understanding of relevant concepts.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Classical conditioning leads us to link seeing a text (a question) with giving an incorrect answer. The stronger this connection grows, the more it can hinder us from learning the right answer, as we might not end up writing it down even after seeing it.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies classical conditioning as the mechanism. The answer key requires understanding of source amnesia (forgetting the source of information), proactive interference (old learning interfering with new), or continued-influence effect. Classical conditioning involves associating stimuli with responses, which doesn't address how incorrect answers interfere with learning correct ones through memory confusion.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

The mere exposure effect suggests that the more often we encounter something, the more we tend to develop a preference for it. Therefore, repeated messages from politicians are likely to generate more favorable attitudes simply because of their repetition.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the mere exposure effect and accurately explains that repeated exposure leads to increased preference. They also correctly apply this concept to the political context, demonstrating understanding of how politicians use repetition to make their messages more attractive.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Certainly. Even individuals without major depressive disorder struggle to accurately predict the intensity of their future emotions, and those with depression tend to overestimate how negative they will feel. Additionally, because negative information and memories stand out more to them, their expectations about future negative experiences are less precise due to availability heuristics and negativity bias.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that people with depression are less accurate at predictions due to overestimating negativity and bias effects. The answer key indicates that depressed individuals are actually MORE accurate because they lack the optimistic bias that non-depressed people have.

Score: 0.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

When sensory information becomes less reliable and unclear, prior beliefs have a greater impact, leading us to perceive what we anticipate. This happens in illusions, where the sensory input is misleading and conflicts with our expectations. As a result, we depend more on our prior knowledge to interpret the stimulus in a way that seems more coherent.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when sensory information becomes less reliable, prior beliefs have greater impact on perception, and they understand that we perceive what we anticipate under these conditions. The example of illusions effectively demonstrates this principle, though the answer key's core concept is fully addressed.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

The first stage is pre-conventional, where a child’s behavior is driven solely by personal interests, and ideas of what is socially right or wrong are not yet developed—at this stage, a child might avoid hitting a sibling only to avoid punishment. The second stage is conventional, where laws, rules, and authorities are adhered to nearly without question, forming the foundation of what is considered good or bad. The final stage is post-conventional, where an individual attains a more profound sense of morality that goes beyond just following laws, recognizing that occasionally breaking the law may be morally justified.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the pre-conventional level as being driven by personal interests and avoiding punishment, which aligns with the answer key's description of obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as adhering to laws, rules, and authorities, which corresponds to the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the post-conventional level as having a deeper sense of morality that goes beyond following laws, which matches the answer key's description of focusing on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

In the causal model, individuals attempt to create a suitable explanation for why an event occurred by linking certain events as causes and effects. Hindsight bias occurs when people think they anticipated an outcome after it has already happened, even if they did not actually foresee it. This happens because, once the outcome is known, previous events seem to logically lead to it, making it feel as though we predicted it.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes a causal model as creating explanations by linking events as causes and effects, which aligns with the answer key's definition of a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student accurately explains how causal models contribute to hindsight bias by making previous events seem to logically lead to known outcomes, which matches the answer key's point that events in causal models seem more inevitable than they were.

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

After discovering the result and the context surrounding it, we cannot erase this knowledge. As a result, we take this information into account when reinterpreting how we previously perceived the situation. This phenomenon is also known as the curse of knowledge, because it is impossible to ignore what we have learned.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly explains that newly learned information cannot be avoided when estimating past likelihood judgments, and properly identifies this as the curse of knowledge. The answer captures the key mechanism of hindsight bias through learning.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing is the traditional perspective where individuals act logically to achieve the greatest possible benefit in a situation. In contrast, satisficing suggests that people aim to meet their needs sufficiently rather than seeking the absolute best and most rational result. People with high levels of neuroticism are more likely to adopt a maximizing decision style.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as seeking the greatest possible benefit/best choice, which aligns with 'trying to make the best choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as aiming to meet needs sufficiently rather than seeking the absolute best, which matches 'making a good-enough choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people with high neuroticism are more likely to adopt a maximizing decision style, exactly matching the answer key.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

Active engagement involves individuals thinking independently about the material beyond just what is presented in textbooks or lecture notes. To gauge their depth of thought, one can ask them to reflect on the content, offer their own examples, or relate it to real-life situations. These types of questions require more targeted feedback, so there should be fewer of them compared to this exam, with opportunities for students to elaborate and make their own connections. The assessment could include a mix of such questions (evaluated by AI) alongside a few more detailed questions that ask for short responses (1-2 paragraphs) and have somewhat different grading standards.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement with the question by addressing the core challenge of promoting active engagement while managing limited resources. They provide concrete strategies including reflection questions, personal examples, real-life connections, and a mixed assessment approach combining AI evaluation with short-response questions. The answer shows thoughtful consideration of practical implementation challenges and offers a realistic solution that balances pedagogical goals with resource constraints.
