## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

System 1 is a fast, automatic thinking process that relies on biases and heuristics, playing a key role in shaping intuition and moral judgment. In contrast, System 2 involves deliberate, logical thinking and is less influential in moral reasoning.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies System 1 as involving fast, automatic processes that shape intuition and moral judgment, which aligns with the answer key's requirement to identify System 1 with intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies System 2 as involving deliberate, logical thinking, which corresponds to the answer key's requirement to identify System 2 with reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student states that System 2 is 'less influential in moral reasoning,' which implies that System 1 is more dominant, satisfying the answer key's requirement about System 1 dominance.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

Representativeness heuristic refers to the tendency to assume that things that appear similar are part of the same category, such as assuming someone is a model based on their appearance.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive bias in this scenario.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that the representativeness heuristic involves assuming category membership based on similarity to typical characteristics, which matches the answer key's explanation about estimating likelihood based on resemblance to stereotypes.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring refers to the idea that the initial information you receive serves as a reference point, creating a strong impression, which you then modify based on subsequent information. The primacy effect means that the first information presented greatly impacts how impressions are formed. Both concepts share the notion that the initial information holds significant importance.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as using initial information as a reference point, which aligns with the answer key's description of taking the first piece of information as the starting point.
- Incorrect: The student describes the primacy effect as impacting impression formation rather than memory retention. The answer key specifically refers to better remembering the first piece of information, which is not captured in the student's response.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both concepts share the importance of initial information, which matches the answer key's point about overreliance on the first piece of information.

Score: 0.6666666666666666

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency to perceive losses as more significant than gains. Risk aversion involves choosing certainty rather than facing uncertainty.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves perceiving losses as more significant than gains, which matches the answer key's point about weighing losses more heavily than gains.
- Correct: The student accurately describes risk aversion as choosing certainty rather than facing uncertainty, which aligns with the answer key's definition of preferring certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 1.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias is the tendency to overpredict how much a future event will affect you. This can affect the choice to end a relationship. When considering a breakup, you might expect to feel much more stressed and sad than you actually will, which can prevent you from leaving even if you are unhappy in the relationship.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as the tendency to overpredict how much a future event will affect you, which captures the essence of overestimating the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Correct: The student accurately explains how impact bias prevents breakups by describing that people overestimate how stressed and sad they will feel after a breakup, which matches the answer key's point about overestimating how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting is the process of anticipating your future emotional state. Although people believe in their ability to do this, they often struggle with accuracy. For example, someone might predict that they would prefer death over living while sick, but when actually faced with the situation, they may choose to continue living.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines affective forecasting as 'the process of anticipating your future emotional state' which matches the answer key's definition of 'predictions about our own future emotional state.'
- Correct: The student accurately explains the end-of-life context by stating that people might predict preferring death over living while sick, but when actually faced with the situation may choose to continue living, which aligns with the answer key's example about healthy people predicting they'll prefer to die when sick but not actually preferring to die when they become sick.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

They tend to overestimate probabilities that are slightly low, but when the probability is extremely low, people will underestimate it, resulting in a difference.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that merely low probabilities are overestimated, which aligns with the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student states that extremely low probabilities are underestimated, but the answer key indicates they are treated as impossibilities (ignored/neglected), which is a different concept than underestimation.

Score: 0.5

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency to give greater importance to losses than to gains. According to prospect theory, losses are perceived as more painful than their actual impact, resulting in negative utility.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion means losses are given greater importance/weight than gains, and mentions that losses result in negative utility. While not using the exact technical language about the value function being steeper for losses, the core concept that losses are weighed more heavily than gains is clearly present.

Score: 1.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory deals with financial options and focuses on calculating probabilities, whereas expected utility theory applies to non-financial choices and incorporates subjectivity, including risk aversion.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory deals with financial options while expected utility theory applies to non-financial choices, which aligns with the answer key's distinction between financial and non-financial values.
- Correct: The student correctly mentions that expected utility theory incorporates subjectivity including risk aversion, which matches the answer key's point about expected utility theory considering risk aversion while expected value theory does not consider heuristics and biases.

Score: 1.0

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected value theory focuses on financial options and involves calculating probabilities. Expected utility theory deals with non-financial choices and incorporates subjectivity, including risk aversion. Multi-attribute utility theory applies to complex scenarios involving multiple criteria and associated weights. Prospect theory explains behavior by considering biases and heuristics.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as dealing with financial options and probabilities, which aligns with the answer key's description of financial outcomes with probabilities.
- Correct: The student accurately describes expected utility theory as dealing with non-financial choices and incorporating subjectivity, which matches the answer key's explanation of utility that can be subjective rather than just financial.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies multi-attribute utility theory as applying to complex scenarios with multiple criteria and weights, which corresponds to the answer key's description of multiple attributes with utilities and weights.
- Correct: The student properly describes prospect theory as explaining behavior through biases and heuristics, which aligns with the answer key's description of it being a descriptive behavioral model that considers heuristics and biases.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency for losses to have a greater impact than gains. Being risk averse means you tend to avoid taking risks. However, in situations where there is a possibility of losing something, you may take actions to prevent losses and become risk seeking, which is the opposite of being risk averse.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion can make people risk seeking rather than risk averse when trying to avoid potential losses, which directly addresses how loss aversion affects risk aversion by potentially decreasing it or even reversing it.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning is a learning process. Classical conditioning involves learning to connect two stimuli that occur together in time and place. Operant conditioning is a process where you learn which behaviors result in punishment and which lead to rewards.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as a learning process, which aligns with the answer key's concept of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as learning to connect two stimuli that occur together in time and place, which matches the answer key's explanation of associating things that happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning which behaviors result in punishment and which lead to rewards, which directly corresponds to the answer key's point about learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation is when you believe one thing causes another, but in reality, they are only correlated. Illusory correlation occurs when you assume a relationship between two things exists, but it actually does not.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly distinguishes between illusory causation (mistaking correlation for causation) and illusory correlation (perceiving a relationship that doesn't exist). The explanation accurately captures the key difference: illusory causation involves misinterpreting an actual correlation as causal, while illusory correlation involves perceiving a correlation that isn't actually there.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

Comprehending the Dutch healthcare system is an example of a schema, as a schema holds knowledge about how things operate in the world. Knowing how to act at a birthday party is a script, since a script is a type of schema that guides behavior in a typical situation.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the Dutch healthcare system as a schema and provides an accurate explanation that schemas hold knowledge about how things operate in the world, which aligns with the answer key's emphasis on knowledge and relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies birthday party behavior as a script and provides a good explanation that scripts guide behavior in typical situations, which matches the answer key's description of scripts as social schemas for specific situational behavior.

Score: 1.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

They take the intentional stance, which involves considering intentions to understand and analyze behavior.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the intentional stance. Behaviorists actually adopted the physical stance because they rejected mental concepts like intentions and focused solely on observable stimulus-response relationships and the physical processes that cause behavior. The intentional stance involves attributing beliefs and desires, which behaviorists explicitly avoided.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

Design stance, as it allows you to examine the purpose of psychological processes.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the design stance and provides an accurate justification that evolutionary psychologists examine the purpose/function of psychological processes, which aligns with the answer key's explanation about considering processes in terms of their function.

Score: 1.0

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

- Distinction: A must be clearly defined.  
- Consistency: Whenever A happens, B must also happen.  
- Plausibility: It is logical to assume that A will lead to B.  
- Contiguous time and space: A must occur in the same place and at the same time as B.  
- Cause and effect are the same: For example, when you kick a ball, the force of the kick (cause) is directly responsible for the ball's movement (effect).

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies distinctness/distinction and provides a reasonable interpretation, though they focus on A being clearly defined rather than B being specific to A.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies consistency and accurately explains that B must always follow A.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies plausibility and provides an accurate explanation that it must be logical for A to cause B.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies contiguity in time and space and accurately explains that A and B must occur at the same time and place.
- Incorrect: The student misunderstands similarity in cause and effect, describing a direct causal relationship rather than superficial resemblance between cause and effect.

Score: 0.8

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

The availability heuristic refers to the tendency to overvalue information that quickly comes to mind. On social media, the most extreme opinions are often the most visible rather than the typical views. As a result, these extreme opinions are more easily recalled, leading you to overestimate the number of people who are morally outraged. Confirmation bias also plays a role, since you look for information that supports your existing beliefs. Thus, encountering more examples of moral outrage reinforces your perception that many people are morally outraged.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student does not mention the negativity bias, instead discussing confirmation bias. While confirmation bias is a real phenomenon, the answer key specifically identifies negativity bias as one of the two primary biases.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the availability heuristic and provides an accurate definition, explaining how easily recalled information leads to overestimation of frequency.
- Correct: The student effectively explains the mechanism by which these biases work together - extreme/outraged content being more visible and easily recalled leads to overestimating moral outrage frequency, which captures the essential connection between the biases and the outcome.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

A framework theory is a general idea about how you perceive the world functions. When you apply knowledge and move from one area to another, a superstition is likely to arise, leading you to believe in magical contagion.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that framework theories from one domain are being applied to another domain, and recognizes this cross-domain application leads to superstitious beliefs like magical contagion. While not explicitly naming the biological and social domains, the core concept of incorrect domain transfer is present.

Score: 1.0

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A delusional conspiracy theory is an irrational belief that is not accepted by society. On the other hand, a non-delusional conspiracy theory might be accurate.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a delusional conspiracy theory is an irrational belief that is not accepted by society, which matches the answer key's criteria of being both irrational and not commonly accepted. The additional comment about non-delusional theories potentially being accurate is consistent with the distinction.

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

You notice patterns in randomness and prefer simple explanations for complicated matters. Be mature.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'seeing patterns in randomness' which directly matches one of the key factors from the answer key.
- Correct: The student mentions 'simple explanations for complicated matters' which corresponds to 'believing in simple explanations for complex events' from the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student only provided two factors instead of the required three, and 'be mature' does not correspond to any cognitive or personality factor listed in the answer key.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

It disrupts conditioning.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's answer about conditioning is not relevant to the psychological mechanisms described in the answer key. The correct mechanisms are source amnesia (forgetting that an answer was incorrect), proactive interference (initial incorrect answers interfering with correct ones), or the continued-influence effect. Conditioning relates to behavioral learning through associations, not memory interference from incorrect quiz answers.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

familiarity through repeated contact

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the core concept of mere exposure - that familiarity gained through repeated contact leads to increased preference, which directly answers the question about the psychological mechanism politicians use when repeating statements.

Score: 1.0

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Healthy individuals tend to underestimate the chances of negative events occurring to them, a tendency known as positivity bias. In contrast, people with major depressive disorder lack this bias, leading them to make more realistic predictions about such outcomes.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people with major depressive disorder are more accurate at making predictions about negative events because they lack the positivity bias (optimism bias) that healthy individuals exhibit, which leads to more realistic rather than overly optimistic predictions.

Score: 1.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

When sensory information is unreliable, prior beliefs take precedence. Therefore, as the trustworthiness of sensory input diminishes, the impact of prior beliefs becomes stronger.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when sensory information becomes unreliable, prior beliefs have increased influence on perception. The answer demonstrates understanding that there is an inverse relationship between sensory reliability and the impact of prior beliefs.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

Pre-conventional: the emphasis is on personal gain, where you distinguish between right and wrong. Conventional: the focus shifts to maintaining a good image in the eyes of others. Post-conventional: you recognize that values can sometimes clash and learn how to navigate those conflicts.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that pre-conventional level focuses on personal gain, which aligns with avoiding punishment or gaining rewards from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes conventional level as focusing on maintaining a good image in others' eyes, which corresponds to the answer key's emphasis on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly captures post-conventional level by describing recognition of clashing values and navigating conflicts, which reflects the abstract principles and values focus from the answer key.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model involves considering a situation and its outcome, assuming that the situation caused the outcome, though this is not always true. When you hold this belief, you tend to think the outcome was foreseeable, even when it wasn't (hindsight bias).

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a causal model involves linking situations to outcomes and understanding causal relationships, which aligns with the concept of a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that causal models make outcomes seem foreseeable when they weren't, which directly corresponds to how events in causal models seem more inevitable than they were, contributing to hindsight bias.

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Hindsight bias is when you believe an outcome was foreseeable, even though it wasn't. Once you gain new information, it's inevitable that this knowledge will influence how you would have predicted the result.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that newly learned information inevitably influences retrospective judgments about past predictions, which is the core mechanism of how learning contributes to hindsight bias described in the answer key.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing refers to aiming for the best possible option, while satisficing involves settling for an option that is good enough. If a person scores high in neuroticism, it is likely that they will adopt a maximizing approach to decision-making.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as 'aiming for the best possible option' which aligns with the answer key's definition of 'trying to make the best choice'.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as 'settling for an option that is good enough' which matches the answer key's definition of 'making a good-enough choice'.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that someone high in neuroticism is likely to adopt a maximizing approach to decision-making, which matches the answer key's expectation.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

It might be beneficial if some portion of the exam consists of multiple choice questions since they take less time to answer. I appreciate the open-ended questions in this course, so I feel it’s unfortunate when the whole exam is made up of multiple choice questions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement by acknowledging the trade-off between efficiency (multiple choice for time constraints) and depth (open-ended questions for engagement), showing understanding of the practical challenge presented in the question.
