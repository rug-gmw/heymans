## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidtâ€™s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

According to the social intuitionist model, System 1 thinking is responsible for fast and automatic decision-making, while System 2 thinking involves slow, deliberate, and effortful reasoning. The model is primarily associated with System 1, indicating that intuitive, automatic processes play the leading role in moral judgments.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 thinking involves fast and automatic processes, which aligns with the answer key's description of System 1 as intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student accurately describes System 2 thinking as slow, deliberate, and effortful reasoning, which matches the answer key's description of System 2 as reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student clearly states that the model is primarily associated with System 1 and that intuitive processes play the leading role, which correctly identifies System 1 as more dominant than System 2.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

The representativeness heuristic occurs when we assume something fits into a category based on how closely it resembles typical members of that category.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying assumption in this scenario.
- Correct: The student provides an accurate explanation of the representativeness heuristic, describing how we estimate category membership based on resemblance to typical category members, which matches the key concept in the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Information given initially can act as a reference point for shaping impressions. The primacy effect describes how people create impressions based on their initial exposure. Both concepts share the idea that first impressions are influenced by the earliest information received.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes anchoring as a reference point for shaping impressions, but doesn't clearly identify it as the tendency to use the first piece of information as a starting point for judgments or decisions.
- Incorrect: The student describes primacy effect as creating impressions based on initial exposure, but misses the key point that it's specifically about better remembering the first piece of information.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both concepts involve the influence of earliest/first information, which aligns with overreliance on first information.

Score: 0.3333333333333333

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion means that individuals place greater importance on losses than on gains. Risk aversion means that people favor certainty rather than uncertainty. Therefore, loss aversion is primarily concerned with the difference between losses and gains, while risk aversion deals with the preference for certainty versus uncertainty.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion means individuals place greater importance on losses than on gains, which matches the answer key's definition of weighing losses more heavily than gains.
- Correct: The student accurately defines risk aversion as people favoring certainty rather than uncertainty, which aligns with the answer key's definition of the tendency to prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 1.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

People often exaggerate how strongly a particular situation will influence their future emotions. The impact bias may stop individuals from ending a relationship because they overpredict the level of unhappiness they will experience after a breakup, even though they are currently unhappy.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as people exaggerating how strongly situations will influence their future emotions, which matches the key concept of overestimating the impact of future events on feelings.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that impact bias prevents breakups because people overpredict the unhappiness they'll feel after breaking up, which aligns with overestimating how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves anticipating how you will feel in the future. This concept is significant in end-of-life choices because individuals might currently believe they prefer to die when facing illness, but once they are actually sick, their desire to die may change.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines affective forecasting as anticipating how you will feel in the future, which matches the answer key's definition of predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Correct: The student accurately explains the importance in end-of-life decisions by noting that healthy people may believe they prefer to die when ill, but their actual preferences may change when they become sick, which aligns with the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

People tend to undervalue low probabilities, with a distinction between moderately low and extremely low probabilities. According to prospect theory, individuals especially underestimate the extremely low probabilities.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student states that people 'undervalue' or 'underestimate' low probabilities, which contradicts the answer key that states merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Incorrect: The student claims that extremely low probabilities are 'underestimated', but the answer key indicates they are often interpreted as impossibilities (ignored entirely), not merely underestimated.

Score: 0.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion means that individuals tend to give greater importance to losses than to equivalent gains.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves giving greater importance/weight to losses than to equivalent gains, which captures the essential concept that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory focuses primarily on financial results, whereas expected utility theory accounts for non-financial outcomes and also incorporates risk aversion.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory focuses on financial results while expected utility theory accounts for non-financial outcomes, which matches the first point in the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly mentions that expected utility theory incorporates risk aversion, which aligns with the second point about considering heuristics and biases (specifically risk aversion) versus not considering them.

Score: 1.0

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesnâ€™t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

1. Expected value theory is a normative approach that primarily focuses on financial factors. 2. Expected utility theory is a normative framework that takes into account both financial and non-financial factors, including risk aversion. 3. Multi-attribute utility theory is a normative model where each choice is characterized by various attributes, each with its own utility and assigned weight. 4. Prospect theory is a descriptive model that builds on expected utility theory by integrating psychological biases and heuristics.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as a normative model focusing on financial factors, which aligns with the answer key's description of financial outcomes with probabilities.
- Correct: The student accurately describes expected utility theory as a normative framework considering both financial and non-financial factors, which matches the answer key's explanation of utilities that can be subjective, not just financial.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies multi-attribute utility theory as a normative model with multiple attributes having utilities and weights, which directly corresponds to the answer key description.
- Correct: The student properly describes prospect theory as a descriptive model building on expected utility theory with psychological biases and heuristics, which aligns with the answer key's description of it being behavioral and considering heuristics and biases.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease peopleâ€™s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Loss aversion means that individuals place greater importance on avoiding losses than on acquiring gains. As a result, people tend to be risk-averse, favoring certainty over uncertainty. While people desire to achieve gains, they prefer these to come with a higher level of assurance rather than unpredictability.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that loss aversion makes people more risk-averse. The answer key indicates that loss aversion can actually decrease risk aversion and make people risk-seeking when trying to avoid potential losses. The student's answer contradicts this key concept by suggesting loss aversion increases risk aversion.

Score: 0.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves learning by noticing associations. Classical conditioning is the process of realizing that two events often occur together in the same time and place. Operant conditioning is understanding that certain actions lead to specific outcomes.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as learning associations, which aligns with the answer key's definition of 'learning associations through covariation.'
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as recognizing that two events often occur together in time and place, which matches the answer key's explanation.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as understanding that actions lead to specific outcomes, which corresponds to the answer key's definition of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation involves linking events in a cause-and-effect manner, while illusory correlation refers to connecting things that frequently occur together. In the case of illusory correlation, there is no definite cause-and-effect connection.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly describes illusory correlation as 'connecting things that frequently occur together' when it actually refers to perceiving correlation between variables that don't actually correlate. While they correctly identify that illusory causation involves incorrect causal interpretation, they miss the key distinction that illusory correlation is about perceiving non-existent correlations rather than just lacking causal connection.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to â€˜properlyâ€™ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

Schema refers to the knowledge of how the Dutch healthcare system operates. It exemplifies a schema because it outlines the guidelines for particular scenarios. Script refers to the expected behavior at a birthday party, serving as an example of a script since it details appropriate conduct in a certain social context.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly identifies the healthcare system as a schema but provides an incorrect explanation, stating it 'outlines guidelines for particular scenarios' rather than explaining that schemas represent organized knowledge and relationships between concepts.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies birthday party behavior as a script and provides an accurate explanation that it details appropriate conduct in a social context, which aligns with the definition of scripts as behavioral sequences for specific situations.

Score: 0.5

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

They chose the physical perspective because they aimed to understand the underlying mechanism. Their goal was to discover how stimuli can cause behavior. This approach is unrelated to the intentional stance, as it does not take into account people's intentions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that behaviorists adopted the physical stance and provides accurate reasoning - they focused on understanding the underlying mechanisms of how stimuli cause behavior, which aligns with the physical stance's emphasis on causal processes.

Score: 1.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

The intentional stance focuses on understanding people's intentions and, consequently, explaining their behavior. It is more connected to behavioral factors compared to the other two stances, which primarily deal with mechanical aspects.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the intentional stance instead of the design stance. While the student provides a reasonable description of the intentional stance, evolutionary psychology adopts the design stance because it explains psychological processes in terms of their adaptive function and evolutionary purpose, not in terms of beliefs and desires (intentional stance).

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Certainly: event A and event B both exist. Distinct: event A is not the same as event B. Plausible: either event A or event B holds a benefit. Close in time and location: event A and B often occur simultaneously. Similar in cause and effect: event A and B usually share the same cause and result.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: Student mentions 'Distinct' but defines it as A not being the same as B, rather than the correct definition that B follows A but not other events (specificity).
- Incorrect: Student does not mention consistency (that B always follows A) at all.
- Incorrect: Student mentions 'Plausible' but incorrectly defines it as either A or B holding a benefit, rather than common sense making it plausible that A causes B.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies contiguity in time and space, stating that A and B occur simultaneously, which captures the essence of temporal and spatial proximity.
- Incorrect: Student misunderstands similarity in cause and effect, saying A and B share the same cause and result, rather than A and B superficially resembling each other.

Score: 0.2

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

The availability heuristic involves people estimating the frequency or likelihood of events based on how easily related instances or memories can be recalled. Negativity bias means people pay more attention to negative emotions. Since social media often displays individuals expressing moral outrage, we tend to overestimate how many people feel this way, combining the effects of both the availability heuristic and negativity bias. As a result, people perceive the world as more pessimistic than it actually is.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions negativity bias but defines it incompletely as 'people pay more attention to negative emotions' rather than the tendency to seek out or place more weight on negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- Correct: The student correctly defines the availability heuristic as estimating frequency or likelihood based on how easily related instances or memories can be recalled, which matches the answer key definition.
- Correct: The student successfully explains how these biases work together - social media displays moral outrage (negativity bias effect), making these examples easily recalled (availability heuristic), leading to overestimation of moral outrage frequency.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

Framework theories are general, intuitive beliefs about how the world operates. When something conflicts with these general intuitive beliefs, people usually tend to avoid it or view it negatively.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes framework theories generally but fails to identify the specific domain transfer that explains magical contagion - that biological contagion concepts are incorrectly applied to social/psychological domains when avoiding objects from disliked people.

Score: 0.0

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

Delusional refers to beliefs that are not recognized or accepted by society. Thus, delusional conspiracy theories involve conspiracies that lack cultural acceptance, while non-delusional conspiracy theories involve conspiracies that might be acknowledged or accepted within a culture.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student only addresses the 'commonly accepted' criterion but omits the 'irrational belief' component. The answer key requires both conditions: a conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both irrational AND not commonly accepted. The student's answer is incomplete as it only discusses cultural/social acceptance.

Score: 0.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

Having faith in supernatural phenomena. Identifying as male. Experiencing a sense of belonging to an in-group versus an out-group.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'having faith in supernatural phenomena' which aligns with 'believing paranormal phenomena' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'identifying as male' which corresponds to 'being a man' from the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student mentions 'experiencing a sense of belonging to an in-group versus an out-group' which is not listed among the cognitive and personality factors in the answer key.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you donâ€™t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

These incorrect answers can disrupt learning due to contextual bias, where you link new information to the environment in which it was acquired.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes contextual bias and environmental linking, which is not the correct psychological mechanism. The answer key requires source amnesia (forgetting that an answer was incorrect), proactive interference (old incorrect answers interfering with new correct ones), or the continued-influence effect. Contextual bias relates to environmental cues affecting memory retrieval, not the interference of incorrect answers with learning correct information.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

They aim to enhance the appeal of their message by utilizing the mere exposure effect.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the mere exposure effect as the psychological mechanism, which matches the answer key's primary answer of 'mere exposure' - the tendency to prefer familiar things.

Score: 1.0

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Individuals with major depressive disorder lack the optimism bias and therefore do not adjust their beliefs significantly in response to positive events. As a result, they may have a more realistic perception of the chances that something negative will occur to them compared to those who exhibit a positivity bias. Consequently, they are not less accurate in making negative predictions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people with major depressive disorder are more accurate (not less accurate) at making predictions about negative events due to their lack of optimism bias, which aligns with the answer key's point about reduced overly optimistic tendencies leading to greater accuracy.

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

When sensory information is reduced or unreliable, perception tends to be heavily influenced by prior beliefs.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when sensory information is unreliable, prior beliefs have increased influence on perception, which directly matches the key concept from the answer key.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You donâ€™t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other peopleâ€™s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

Pre-conventional: seeing reward as positive and punishment as negative. Conventional: behaving rightly by following laws and societal expectations. Post-conventional: moral principles are guided by good intentions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that pre-conventional level focuses on rewards and punishments, which aligns with the answer key's description of 'obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.'
- Correct: The student accurately describes conventional level as following laws and societal expectations, which matches the answer key's focus on 'social norms and other people's feelings.'
- Incorrect: The student describes post-conventional level as being guided by 'good intentions,' which is too vague and doesn't capture the answer key's emphasis on 'abstract principles and values.'

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model involves the idea that events or phenomena have a cause-and-effect connection. This relates to hindsight bias, as individuals frequently link events as if one caused the other. As a result, people claim they predicted the outcome all along, which is the essence of hindsight bias.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a causal model involves cause-and-effect connections between events, which aligns with the answer key's description of a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student accurately explains how causal models contribute to hindsight bias by making people believe they could predict outcomes, which corresponds to the answer key's point about events seeming more inevitable than they actually were.

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

People struggle to reflect on and remember previous probabilities without being influenced by the information they have recently acquired.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people cannot avoid being influenced by newly acquired information when trying to recall or estimate their previous probability judgments, which directly matches the key concept in the answer key.

Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing involves choosing the optimal option, while satisficing means selecting an option that is sufficiently good. Neuroticism is connected to maximizing.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as choosing the optimal option, which aligns with 'trying to make the best choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as selecting an option that is sufficiently good, which matches 'making a good-enough choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that neuroticism is connected to maximizing, which corresponds to the answer key's point that high neuroticism leads to adopting the maximizing decision style.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

To encourage students to actively participate with the content, you can use social cues. For instance, randomly selecting a student during a lecture to answer a question about the material can create a sense of accountability. This approach motivates students to stay engaged, as they are less likely to want to provide an incorrect response in front of their peers.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement with the question by providing a specific, practical strategy (cold calling/random selection) that addresses the core challenge of promoting active engagement with limited resources. The answer shows understanding of social psychology principles (peer accountability, social pressure) and offers a concrete implementation method that is resource-efficient for large classes.
