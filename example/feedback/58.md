## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidtâ€™s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

System 1 thinking is quick and instinctive, and according to this model, moral judgments are primarily driven by this intuitive process. In contrast, System 2 is slower and more deliberate, functioning mainly to justify decisions after they have been made.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies System 1 as intuitive/instinctive thinking, which aligns with the answer key's requirement that System 1 refers to intuitions or emotion.
- Correct: The student correctly describes System 2 as slower and more deliberate, which corresponds to the answer key's requirement that System 2 refers to reasoning, rational thought, or deliberation.
- Correct: The student clearly states that moral judgments are 'primarily driven' by System 1 (intuitive process) and that System 2 mainly functions to justify decisions after they're made, demonstrating that System 1 is dominant over System 2.

Score: 1.0

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

The representativeness heuristic refers to judging the likelihood that someone or something belongs to a certain category based on how closely they match the typical characteristics or stereotype of that category.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process in this scenario.
- Correct: The student provides an accurate explanation of the representativeness heuristic, describing how we judge likelihood of category membership based on similarity to typical characteristics or stereotypes of that category.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring: The initial piece of information or impression acts as a reference point. Primacy effect: the first information has more impact than information encountered later. In both cases, adjustments made based on subsequent information are inadequate, causing the final judgment to be largely shaped by the initial information or impression.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as using initial information as a reference point, which aligns with the answer key's description of taking the first piece of information as the starting point.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as first information having more impact than later information, which corresponds to the answer key's point about better remembering the first piece of information.
- Correct: The student clearly explains that both effects result in overreliance on initial information, with inadequate adjustments from subsequent information, which matches the answer key's point about both corresponding to overreliance on the first piece of information.

Score: 1.0

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion centers on preventing losses, while risk aversion is concerned with steering clear of risky circumstances.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes loss aversion as 'preventing losses' but misses the key concept that losses are weighted more heavily than equivalent gains. The definition lacks the comparative aspect that is central to loss aversion.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that risk aversion involves 'steering clear of risky circumstances,' which captures the essence of preferring certainty over uncertainty, though expressed in different terms.

Score: 0.5

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias is a cognitive bias in which a person exaggerates the effect that a future event will have on their emotions. This often causes individuals to overpredict how negative they will feel after a breakup, which can stop them from ending an unhappy relationship.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as exaggerating the effect of future events on emotions, which matches the answer key's definition of overestimating the impact of future events on future feelings.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that impact bias prevents breakups because people overpredict how negative they will feel after a breakup, which aligns with the answer key's point about overestimating how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves anticipating how you will feel in future situations. People often misjudge their future emotions, such as with decisions made near the end of life. Many tend to overestimate the negative feelings they will experience, but in reality, their actual feelings differ from their predictions. This can result in end-of-life choices that no longer align with their true feelings. Therefore, considering affective forecasting is important to ensure these decisions better reflect the individual's preferences and help families make appropriate choices when the person is no longer able to decide.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies affective forecasting as anticipating or predicting future emotions, which aligns with the answer key's definition of 'predictions about our own future emotional state.'
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of the core concept that people's actual feelings when sick differ from their predictions when healthy, leading to misaligned end-of-life decisions, which matches the answer key's point about healthy people predicting they'd prefer to die when sick but potentially feeling differently when actually ill.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

Individuals tend to overvalue unlikely events while undervaluing those that are extremely rare.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that unlikely events (merely low probabilities) are overvalued/overestimated, which matches the answer key point about overestimation of low probabilities.
- Correct: The student correctly states that extremely rare events are undervalued, which aligns with the answer key point that extremely low probabilities are treated as impossibilities (essentially underestimated or ignored).

Score: 1.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion is a bias where individuals perceive losses as more significant than equivalent gains. For instance, losing 10 euros feels as impactful as gaining 15 euros.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion means losses are perceived as more significant than equivalent gains, which directly corresponds to the answer key's point that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. The concrete example with euros effectively illustrates this asymmetric weighting.

Score: 1.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected utility theory expands on expected value theory by incorporating subjective outcomes for choices rather than just financial outcomes. While value theory identifies the best option as the one with the greatest value, utility theory seeks the option that provides the highest utility.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected utility theory incorporates subjective outcomes beyond just financial outcomes, which aligns with the answer key point about expected utility dealing with non-financial values while expected value theory deals only with financial values.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention risk aversion or heuristics and biases as key differences between the theories. They only discuss the general concept of utility versus value without addressing the specific behavioral aspects that distinguish expected utility theory.

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesnâ€™t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected value theory considers choices based on their financial outcomes, aiming to select the option with the greatest expected value. Expected utility theory is similar but also incorporates subjective outcomes, seeking the option with the highest overall utility. Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT) is applied in complex decisions, evaluating options based on multiple attributes, each assigned a specific utility and weight. Prospect theory is a descriptive model that examines how heuristics and biases influence the decision-making process.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as considering financial outcomes and selecting the option with greatest expected value, which aligns with the normative model described in the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes expected utility theory as similar to expected value theory but incorporating subjective outcomes and seeking highest utility, matching the answer key's description.
- Correct: The student correctly explains MAUT as evaluating options based on multiple attributes with assigned utilities and weights, which matches the answer key's description of this normative model.
- Correct: The student accurately identifies prospect theory as a descriptive model that examines how heuristics and biases influence decision-making, which aligns with the answer key's description of it as a behavioral model.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease peopleâ€™s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency for individuals to give more importance to losses than to gains. When a situation is presented as a potential gain, people tend to avoid risks, but when there is a possibility of loss, they are more likely to take risks. This influences how risk-averse people are.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion makes people more willing to take risks when facing potential losses, which decreases their risk aversion in loss domains. The answer captures the key concept that people become risk-seeking to avoid losses, even though it could be more explicit about the contrast with risk aversion in gain domains.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves learning that two events are connected or occur together. In classical conditioning, this association is formed because the two events consistently take place simultaneously and in the same setting. In operant conditioning, the connection is learned through the use of positive stimuli (rewards) for desirable behavior and negative stimuli (punishments) for undesirable behavior.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as learning connections between events, which aligns with the answer key's definition of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as forming associations when two events consistently occur simultaneously and in the same setting, matching the answer key's explanation of learning to associate things that happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning connections through rewards for desirable behavior and punishments for undesirable behavior, which corresponds to the answer key's description of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation is perceiving a cause-and-effect relationship between two events when none actually exists, while illusory correlation is noticing a connection or association between events that does not truly exist.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly defines illusory causation as perceiving causation when none exists, rather than incorrectly interpreting an existing correlation as causal. The definition of illusory correlation is accurate but the key distinction between the two concepts is missed.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to â€˜properlyâ€™ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

Example 1 represents a schema, as it offers an understanding and framework for how things operate within the particular setting of Dutch healthcare. Example 2 is a script, as it outlines the expected behavior in a typical social scenario.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that understanding the Dutch healthcare system is a schema and provides an appropriate explanation that it involves understanding and framework for how things operate, which aligns with the concept of schemas as knowledge structures about relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script and appropriately explains it as outlining expected behavior in a social scenario, which matches the definition of scripts as social schemas for specific situational behaviors.

Score: 1.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

Psychological stance, as it centers on the mental processes and brain functions activated by specific stimuli, rather than the intent behind the trigger like the design stance does.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the psychological stance instead of the physical stance. Behaviorists explicitly rejected studying mental processes and brain functions, focusing instead on observable stimulus-response relationships at the physical level of analysis.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

Design stance, since it focuses on the function of psychological processes.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the design stance and provides the accurate reasoning that evolutionary psychologists focus on the function of psychological processes, which aligns perfectly with the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Specific: Event A results in event B rather than any other outcome. Consistent: Event B invariably occurs after event A. Plausible: Based on my prior understanding, it is reasonable that event A could cause event B. Contiguous in time and location: Events A and B happen at the same place and within the same timeframe. Similar in cause and effect: Events A and B share some resemblance in their causes and consequences.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies specificity/distinctness, explaining that A results in B rather than other outcomes, which matches the key concept that B follows A but not other events.
- Correct: The student accurately describes consistency as B invariably occurring after A, which aligns with the answer key's requirement that B always follows A.
- Correct: The student correctly explains plausibility as being based on prior understanding that A could reasonably cause B, matching the answer key's emphasis on common sense plausibility.
- Correct: The student accurately describes contiguity as events happening at the same place and timeframe, which corresponds to the answer key's requirement of same time and location.
- Incorrect: The student misinterprets similarity, describing it as sharing resemblance in causes and consequences rather than A and B superficially resembling each other as stated in the answer key.

Score: 0.8

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Availability bias: The likelihood of an event is judged based on how readily examples or situations come to mind. If examples are easily recalled, the event is seen as more probable; if they are hard to recall, it is viewed as less likely. Negativity bias: Individuals have a tendency to focus on and remember negative information. On social media, people are more inclined to pay attention to and retain negative content. As a result, when making judgments, many negative examples come to mind easily, causing an overestimation of how many people are morally outraged.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias and explains it as the tendency to focus on and remember negative information, specifically noting how people pay attention to negative content on social media.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies availability bias (using slightly different terminology) and accurately explains it as judging likelihood based on how readily examples come to mind, with easily recalled examples seeming more probable.
- Correct: The student successfully connects both biases to explain the overestimation phenomenon - negativity bias causes attention to negative content, which makes negative examples easily recalled, leading through availability bias to overestimating moral outrage frequency.

Score: 1.0

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

It is a broad concept (framework theory) suggesting that individuals can project their identity onto objects or places. Therefore, when you encounter an object strongly disliked by someone important to you, your mind applies a mental framework that helps you interpret the situation and prompts you to steer clear of that object.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes a general psychological framework about identity projection but fails to identify the key concept from the answer key: that biological contagion concepts are being incorrectly applied to the social/psychological domain. The answer doesn't mention domain-specific knowledge or cross-domain application of framework theories.

Score: 0.0

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A conspiracy theory is considered delusional if it is not recognized or accepted by a broad group of people.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student only identified one criterion (lack of broad acceptance) but missed the crucial requirement that a delusional conspiracy theory must also be an irrational belief. The answer key specifies both conditions must be met.

Score: 0.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

Having faith in paranormal events often stems from a preference for straightforward explanations to complicated circumstances. Being male

Feedback:

- Correct: The student mentions 'having faith in paranormal events' which corresponds to 'believing paranormal phenomena' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student refers to 'preference for straightforward explanations to complicated circumstances' which matches 'believing in simple explanations for complex events' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student mentions 'Being male' which corresponds to 'being a man' from the answer key.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you donâ€™t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Starting with an initial reference point and then making adjustments to reach a final decision or estimate.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes anchoring bias, which is about starting with a reference point and making adjustments. This is completely unrelated to the question about how incorrect answers during self-quizzing can interfere with learning. The correct answer should involve source amnesia, proactive interference, or the continued-influence effect.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

Source amnesia refers to the inability to remember where or how one acquired certain information.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes source amnesia, which is unrelated to the question about psychological mechanisms that make repeated messages more attractive. The correct answer should mention mere exposure effect or illusory-truth effect.

Score: 0.0

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

affirmative

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The answer 'affirmative' does not demonstrate understanding of the key concept that people with major depressive disorder are more accurate at predictions due to reduced optimism bias. It lacks the specific explanation about reduced overly optimistic tendencies that makes depressed individuals more realistic in their risk assessments.

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

The impact of existing beliefs on how we perceive things grows stronger.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that prior beliefs have increased influence on perception when sensory information is less reliable, which matches the core concept from the answer key.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You donâ€™t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other peopleâ€™s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

Pre-conventional: Viewing rewards as positive and punishments as negative. Conventional: Emphasizing the importance of being perceived as good by others. Post-conventional: Concentrating on universal moral principles.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the pre-conventional level as focusing on rewards and punishments, which aligns with the answer key's description of obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately captures the conventional level's emphasis on being perceived as good by others, which corresponds to the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the post-conventional level as concentrating on universal moral principles, which matches the answer key's description of focusing on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

Causal model: People create explanations based on the events that actually occurred, rather than considering other possible outcomes. This process fosters hindsight bias because the actual situation appears logical and easy to understand, making individuals feel that the outcome was unavoidable and that they had foreseen it all along.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a causal model involves creating explanations/narratives of events that occurred, which aligns with the concept of a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student accurately explains how causal models contribute to hindsight bias by making outcomes appear logical, unavoidable, and foreseeable, which matches the key point that events seem more inevitable than they were.

Score: 1.0

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

It is challenging to reflect on past decisions without the insight gained later, which affects how those choices are assessed and leads to hindsight bias.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that newly acquired knowledge/insight cannot be avoided when reflecting on past decisions, which is the core mechanism of how learning contributes to hindsight bias. The answer captures the essential concept that later-gained information interferes with accurate recall of past likelihood judgments.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing involves seeking the best possible choice, while satisficing means opting for an option that is good enough. Individuals with a neurotic personality trait are more likely to engage in maximizing.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as seeking the best possible choice, which aligns with the answer key's definition of 'trying to make the best choice'.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as opting for an option that is good enough, which matches the answer key's definition of 'making a good-enough choice'.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that individuals with neurotic personality traits are more likely to engage in maximizing, which matches the answer key's statement about high neuroticism leading to maximizing decision style.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

I would present the material in terms of gains, as this encourages students to be more cautious and results in them attending all lectures and reading the book thoroughly. When framed as a loss, students tend to take more risks, leading them to skip lectures and engage less with the material.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement by applying prospect theory concepts (gains vs. losses framing) to educational design. They provide a specific, reasoned approach with clear rationale for how framing affects student behavior and engagement, showing thoughtful consideration of the question.
