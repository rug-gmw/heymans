## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidtâ€™s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

Our moral judgments are initially formed by instinctive feelings, which correspond to system 1 thinking. Later, we create reasons to support these judgments, representing system 2 thinking. In this framework, system 1 thinking is more influential since it forms the foundation of the judgment, and the reasoning process doesn't always occur.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 thinking involves instinctive feelings/intuitions in moral judgment formation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes System 2 thinking as the reasoning process that creates justifications for moral judgments.
- Correct: The student correctly states that System 1 thinking is more influential/dominant, explaining that it forms the foundation of judgment while reasoning doesn't always occur.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

The representativeness heuristic refers to judging the likelihood that something belongs to a particular category based on how closely it resembles that category. In other words, if x appears similar to Y, then x is likely to be Y.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying mechanism for this assumption.
- Correct: The student accurately explains the representativeness heuristic as judging likelihood of category membership based on similarity to that category, which matches the answer key's explanation about estimating likelihood based on resemblance to stereotypes.

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring refers to using the initial value as a baseline that can be modified when new information is presented. Primacy effects describe the tendency for the information encountered first to have an outsized impact. Both concepts relate to the initial information we receive.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as using initial/first information as a baseline or starting point, which aligns with the answer key's definition.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as the tendency for first-encountered information to have outsized impact, which captures the essence of better remembering first information.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both concepts relate to initial/first information, demonstrating understanding of their common overreliance on first pieces of information.

Score: 1.0

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency to avoid losses rather than acquire gains, while risk aversion involves favoring sure outcomes over uncertain ones.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves preferring to avoid losses rather than acquire gains, which captures the essence of weighing losses more heavily than equivalent gains.
- Correct: The student accurately describes risk aversion as favoring sure outcomes over uncertain ones, which correctly captures the preference for certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 1.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

The impact bias leads us to exaggerate the influence that future events will have on our emotions. This can stop individuals from ending relationships, as they may believe their emotions will worsen afterward.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as exaggerating the influence of future events on emotions, which matches the answer key's definition of overestimating the impact of future events on future feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly explains that impact bias prevents breakups because people believe their emotions will worsen afterward, which aligns with the answer key's point about overestimating how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves predicting how we will feel in the future. It is important to pay attention to this because we often make mistakes in these predictions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that affective forecasting involves predicting future emotional states, which matches the answer key's definition of 'predictions about our own future emotional state.'
- Incorrect: While the student mentions that we make mistakes in affective forecasting predictions, they fail to specifically connect this to end-of-life decisions or explain the key example that healthy people may predict preferring death when sick but change their preference when actually ill.

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

According to prospect theory, individuals tend to overvalue small probabilities. While low probabilities are generally exaggerated, extremely low probabilities are perceived as zero because they are considered impossible.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that low probabilities are overvalued/exaggerated according to prospect theory, which aligns with the answer key point that merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Correct: The student accurately states that extremely low probabilities are perceived as zero because they are considered impossible, which directly matches the answer key point about extremely low probabilities being interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion represents a consistent mistake in evaluating utility.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly characterizes loss aversion as a 'mistake' rather than explaining that it reflects the asymmetric weighting where negative utilities (losses) are weighted more heavily than positive utilities (gains) of equal magnitude.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory applies only to financial choices, while expected utility theory is applicable to both financial and non-financial decisions. Additionally, expected utility theory considers risk aversion, unlike expected value theory.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory deals only with financial choices while expected utility theory applies to both financial and non-financial decisions, which matches the answer key's distinction between financial and non-financial values.
- Correct: The student correctly states that expected utility theory considers risk aversion while expected value theory does not, which aligns with the answer key's point about expected utility theory considering risk aversion versus expected value theory not considering heuristics and biases.

Score: 1.0

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesnâ€™t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected value theory suggests that the most rational decision is the one that yields the highest average outcome over time. Expected utility theory proposes that every possible result has an associated utility value. Multi-attribute theory extends this by assigning both utility values and weights to different outcomes. Prospect theory builds on expected utility theory by incorporating heuristics and cognitive biases, serving as a descriptive model.

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies expected value theory as focusing on highest average outcome over time, which aligns with the normative model concept and probability-based financial outcomes.
- Correct: Student accurately describes expected utility theory as assigning utility values to outcomes, capturing the key difference from expected value theory regarding subjective utility.
- Correct: Student correctly explains multi-attribute theory as extending utility theory with both utility values and weights, though they say 'outcomes' rather than 'attributes' - the core concept is understood.
- Correct: Student accurately describes prospect theory as building on expected utility theory while incorporating heuristics and biases, and correctly identifies it as a descriptive model.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease peopleâ€™s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency for individuals to prioritize avoiding losses rather than acquiring gains. Therefore, when a situation is presented in terms of potential losses, people tend to take greater risks.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion leads people to take greater risks when situations involve potential losses, which demonstrates understanding that loss aversion can decrease risk aversion and make people risk-seeking in loss domains.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning is the process of learning by making connections through co-occurrence. Classical conditioning involves learning that two events occur simultaneously and linking them. Operant conditioning involves learning associations based on consequences like punishment and rewards.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as learning through connections/associations via co-occurrence, which aligns with the answer key's definition of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as learning that two events occur simultaneously and linking them, which matches the answer key's description of associating things that happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning associations based on consequences like punishment and rewards, which corresponds to the answer key's description of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation occurs when we incorrectly interpret a correlation as a cause-and-effect relationship, even though the correlation is real. In contrast, illusory correlation involves perceiving a connection between two things that actually has no basis.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly distinguishes between illusory causation (misinterpreting real correlation as causation) and illusory correlation (perceiving non-existent correlation). The explanation accurately captures that illusory causation involves a real correlation being misinterpreted, while illusory correlation involves perceiving a relationship that doesn't actually exist.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to â€˜properlyâ€™ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

The Dutch healthcare system is a schema since it represents an understanding of what to anticipate. A birthday party is considered a script because it is a social schema describing a typical scenario.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the Dutch healthcare system as a schema and provides a reasonable explanation that it represents understanding and expectations, which aligns with schemas being knowledge structures about relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies birthday party behavior as a script and accurately describes it as a social schema for a typical scenario, which matches the answer key's explanation of scripts as behavioral guidelines for specific situations.

Score: 1.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

The mechanical perspective focuses on how stimuli provoke behaviors, emphasizing the connection between the two without speculating on the reasons behind the occurrence.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student uses 'mechanical perspective' instead of 'physical stance' which is incorrect terminology for Dennett's framework. While they correctly identify the focus on stimulus-behavior connections, they fail to use the proper conceptual framework requested in the question.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

Design stance, since evolutionary psychology views all psychological processes as having a purpose or being beneficial.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the design stance and provides an accurate justification that evolutionary psychology views psychological processes as having a purpose or being beneficial, which aligns with the functional perspective described in the answer key.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

- uniqueness - reliability - believable - close in time and location - comparable in cause and outcome

Feedback:

- Correct: Student uses 'uniqueness' which captures the same concept as distinctness/specificity - that B follows A but not other events.
- Correct: Student uses 'reliability' which effectively conveys the same meaning as consistency - that B reliably/always follows A.
- Correct: Student uses 'believable' which directly corresponds to plausibility - both refer to common sense acceptance of the causal relationship.
- Correct: Student phrase 'close in time and location' accurately captures contiguity in time and space from the answer key.
- Correct: Student phrase 'comparable in cause and outcome' effectively expresses similarity in cause and effect - both describe resemblance between A and B.

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Negativity bias refers to our tendency to focus more on negative information. Since negative content, such as moral outrage, stands out more, we notice it more frequently and can more easily recall examples of it due to the availability heuristic. This leads us to overestimate the number of people who are actually morally outraged.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias and accurately describes it as the tendency to focus more on negative information, which aligns with the answer key's description of seeking out or placing more weight on negative information.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the availability heuristic and demonstrates understanding that it involves recalling examples more easily, which corresponds to the answer key's definition of estimating frequency based on ease of recall.
- Correct: The student successfully explains the connection between the two biases - that negativity bias makes us notice moral outrage more, which through availability heuristic leads to overestimating how many people are morally outraged, matching the causal relationship described in the answer key.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

Cross-modal means that information from one area can affect or impact another area.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's answer describes cross-modal information transfer but doesn't address the specific concept of magical contagion or explain how biological domain concepts (contagion) are incorrectly applied to social/psychological domains when avoiding objects from disliked people.

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

Conspiracy theories that are delusional are not accepted by culture, whereas non-delusional ones are.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student only identifies the 'not commonly accepted' criterion but misses the equally important 'irrational belief' component. The answer key requires both conditions - that the belief be irrational AND not commonly accepted - to distinguish delusional from non-delusional conspiracy theories.

Score: 0.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

- favoring straightforward explanations instead of complex ones  
- exhibit narcissistic traits  
- are male

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'favoring straightforward explanations instead of complex ones' which matches the answer key point about 'believing in simple explanations for complex events'.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'exhibit narcissistic traits' which directly corresponds to the answer key point about 'being narcissistic'.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'are male' which matches the answer key point about 'being a man'.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you donâ€™t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Feedback helps us recognize and fix errors, allowing us to learn from them. Without feedback, this process doesn't occur, and wrong answers hinder the learning process.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student discusses the general importance of feedback in learning but fails to identify the specific psychological mechanism asked for. The answer does not mention source amnesia, proactive interference, or the continued-influence effect, which are the key mechanisms by which incorrect answers can interfere with learning even when correct feedback is provided.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

Mere exposure refers to the phenomenon where repeated exposure to something leads us to view it more favorably.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies mere exposure as the psychological mechanism and accurately describes it as the phenomenon where repeated exposure leads to more favorable views, which matches the answer key's definition of the tendency to prefer familiar things.

Score: 1.0

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

No. The positivity bias suggests that healthy individuals tend to be less accurate in anticipating negative events and often underestimate the likelihood of bad things happening to them.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people with major depressive disorder are more accurate, and demonstrates understanding of the positivity bias concept - that healthy individuals underestimate negative events. This aligns with the answer key's point about reduced overly optimistic tendencies in depression.

Score: 1.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

As sensory information becomes less reliable, prior beliefs take on a greater role and exert more influence over perception.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when sensory information becomes less reliable, prior beliefs have greater influence on perception, which directly matches the key concept in the answer key.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You donâ€™t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other peopleâ€™s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

The first stage is pre-conventional, where individuals make moral decisions based on their own interests, responding to rewards and punishments. The second stage is conventional, where moral decisions are influenced by consideration for others' feelings and the desire to avoid causing harm. The final stage is post-conventional, where moral reasoning is guided by universal ethical principles.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the pre-conventional level and accurately describes it as being based on rewards and punishments, which matches the answer key's description of obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the conventional level and describes it as being influenced by consideration for others' feelings, which aligns with the answer key's description of focusing on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the post-conventional level and describes it as being guided by universal ethical principles, which matches the answer key's description of focusing on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

Causal models serve as intuitive links connecting our prior beliefs to events that have actually occurred. This leads to hindsight bias because we create causal explanations based on what did happen, rather than what might have happened. As a result, events appear more unavoidable than they truly are (a process known as creeping determinism).

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that causal models are explanatory frameworks that connect events, describing them as 'intuitive links connecting our prior beliefs to events that have actually occurred,' which captures the essence of a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student accurately explains how causal models contribute to hindsight bias by making events 'appear more unavoidable than they truly are' and even uses the correct technical term 'creeping determinism,' demonstrating understanding of how inevitability perception contributes to hindsight bias.

Score: 1.0

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Learning leads to hindsight bias because when assessing probabilities again, itâ€™s impossible to disregard accurate information. This new information disrupts the original judgment, causing it to move closer to what actually happened. This phenomenon is known as the curse of knowledge.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly explains that learning contributes to hindsight bias by making it impossible to disregard newly acquired information when reassessing past probability judgments, and appropriately identifies this as the curse of knowledge phenomenon.

Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing involves selecting the best possible option, while satisficing involves choosing an option that is good enough. A person with high neuroticism is likely to use the maximizing approach.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as selecting the best possible option, which aligns with the answer key's description of trying to make the best choice.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as choosing an option that is good enough, which matches the answer key's definition of making a good-enough choice.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

Utilize 'slimstampen,' a tool that assists students in studying the material online. It automatically grades their responses, and if you want to encourage students further, you can reward them with a 0.5 bonus on the exam for correctly completing all the chapters. Incentives are more effective motivators than penalties!

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement with the question by proposing a specific, practical solution (SlimStampen) that addresses the core challenge of limited time and resources while promoting active engagement. The answer shows understanding of automated assessment tools, includes a thoughtful incentive structure, and reflects on motivational psychology principles.
