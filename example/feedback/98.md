## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

System 1 thinking represents the intuitive aspect of moral judgment, while System 2 involves deliberate, logical evaluation of those moral decisions, allowing for correction if needed. In this model, System 1 is considered the more dominant influence.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies System 1 thinking as representing the intuitive aspect of moral judgment, which aligns with the answer key's requirement to identify System 1 as intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student accurately describes System 2 as involving 'deliberate, logical evaluation,' which corresponds to the answer key's definition of System 2 as reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student explicitly states that 'System 1 is considered the more dominant influence,' which directly matches the answer key's requirement that System 1 thinking is more dominant than System 2.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

The representativeness heuristic involves estimating the likelihood of something belonging to a particular category based on how much it resembles typical members of that category.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student did not explicitly identify that the representativeness heuristic underlies the assumption about the colleague being a fashion model, which was the first part of the question.
- Correct: The student correctly explained the representativeness heuristic as estimating likelihood of category membership based on resemblance to typical members, which matches the answer key's explanation.

Score: 0.5

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring refers to the tendency to rely on the initial information we receive as a reference for forming impressions. The primacy effect means that the first information disproportionately influences our impressions. Both concepts share the idea that the initial information holds the most weight.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as relying on initial information as a reference point, which matches the key concept of taking first information as a starting point.
- Incorrect: The student describes primacy effect as first information influencing impressions rather than the tendency to better remember first information, missing the memory component.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both concepts involve giving disproportionate weight to initial information, demonstrating understanding of their common overreliance on first information.

Score: 0.6666666666666666

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency to perceive losses as more significant than equivalent gains. In contrast, risk aversion involves a preference for reducing or completely avoiding risk.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves perceiving losses as more significant than equivalent gains, which matches the answer key's description of weighing losses more heavily than gains.
- Correct: The student accurately describes risk aversion as a preference for reducing or avoiding risk, which aligns with the answer key's definition of preferring certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 1.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias refers to our tendency to exaggerate the effect that future events will have on our emotions. For example, people often assume that a breakup will significantly worsen their feelings, even if they are already unhappy.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as the tendency to exaggerate the effect of future events on emotions, which matches the answer key's definition of overestimating the impact of future events on future feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly explains how impact bias prevents breakups by stating people assume breakups will significantly worsen their feelings even when already unhappy, which aligns with overestimating how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves predicting how a choice will influence our future emotions. This is particularly relevant to end-of-life decisions because people often inaccurately anticipate their future feelings. In the context of death, an individual’s actual emotional state at that moment may differ significantly from what they had originally expected.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies affective forecasting as predictions about future emotional states, though they phrase it as 'how a choice will influence our future emotions' rather than direct predictions about emotional states.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of the key concept that people's actual emotional states when facing end-of-life situations may differ from their earlier predictions, which aligns with the answer key's point about healthy people's preferences changing when they become sick.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

Prospect theory suggests that individuals tend to overvalue small probabilities, and this tendency remains consistent whether the probabilities are simply low or exceptionally low.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that prospect theory suggests people overvalue (overestimate) small/low probabilities, which aligns with the answer key point about merely low probabilities being overestimated.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that the tendency remains consistent for exceptionally low probabilities, missing the key distinction that extremely low probabilities are often treated as impossibilities rather than being overestimated.

Score: 0.5

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion in prospect theory means that people typically consider losses more significant than gains, assigning a greater negative utility to losses than the positive utility they assign to equivalent gains.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion means losses are weighed more heavily than gains, and specifically mentions that negative utility from losses is greater than positive utility from equivalent gains, which captures the key concept that the value function is steeper for losses than gains.

Score: 1.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory considers only financial results, whereas expected utility theory includes non-financial outcomes as well. Additionally, expected utility theory accounts for risk aversion, which expected value theory does not.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory deals only with financial values while expected utility theory includes non-financial outcomes, which matches the first point in the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately states that expected utility theory accounts for risk aversion while expected value theory does not, which aligns with the second point about expected utility theory considering risk aversion whereas expected value theory does not consider heuristics and biases.

Score: 1.0

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected value utility is a model that helps identify the best choice for achieving the most favorable financial result. Expected utility theory extends this by incorporating the utility of an action and can be applied to both financial and non-financial decisions to determine the most advantageous outcome. Multi-attribute utility theory evaluates various attributes of a decision, each assigned a different utility and weight based on its importance. Prospect theory is a descriptive model that accounts for the heuristics and biases people use in decision-making, expanding upon expected utility theory.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as focused on financial outcomes and achieving the most favorable financial result, which aligns with the normative model choosing between options with probabilistic financial outcomes.
- Correct: The student accurately describes expected utility theory as extending expected value theory beyond financial outcomes to include subjective utility, and correctly notes it can be applied to non-financial decisions.
- Correct: The student correctly explains multi-attribute utility theory as evaluating various attributes with different utilities and weights based on importance, which matches the answer key description of multiple attributes each having utility and weight.
- Correct: The student accurately identifies prospect theory as a descriptive model that accounts for heuristics and biases in decision-making, and correctly notes it builds upon expected utility theory, matching the behavioral/descriptive nature described in the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Loss aversion means we perceive losses as more significant than gains, making us more cautious about taking risks. Even when a potential gain is greater, the fear of losing often prevents us from taking chances because losses have a stronger impact on us.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that loss aversion makes people more risk averse and cautious. The answer key indicates that loss aversion actually decreases risk aversion and can make people risk-seeking when they face potential losses, as people are willing to accept risk to avoid losses.

Score: 0.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves learning connections through experiencing events that occur together. Classical conditioning is the process of linking stimuli that happen simultaneously or in the same environment. Operant conditioning involves learning the relationship between a behavior and the resulting reward or punishment.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as learning connections/associations through experiencing events that occur together, which aligns with the key concept of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as linking stimuli that happen simultaneously or in the same environment, which matches the answer key's description of learning to associate things that happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning the relationship between behavior and resulting rewards or punishments, which directly corresponds to the answer key's definition of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory correlation occurs when we perceive a connection between things that aren't actually related. Illusory causation happens when we interpret a real correlation as a cause-and-effect relationship, even though it isn't causal.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly distinguishes that illusory correlation involves perceiving connections between unrelated variables, while illusory causation involves misinterpreting real correlations as causal relationships. This matches the key distinction in the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

Understanding the Dutch health care system is a schema, as it represents a collection of knowledge that helps anticipate behavior. In contrast, knowing the appropriate conduct at a birthday party is a script, since it is a socially and culturally specific schema designed for typical situations like a birthday celebration.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the healthcare system as a schema and provides a reasonable explanation that it represents a collection of knowledge, which aligns with the answer key's emphasis on knowledge and relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies birthday party behavior as a script and accurately explains it as a socially and culturally specific schema for typical situations, which matches the answer key's description of a social schema for specific situational behavior.

Score: 1.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

They embraced the physiological perspective because they aim to understand behavior by studying how the underlying mechanisms and physical properties function.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that behaviorists adopted the physical stance (referring to it as 'physiological perspective') and provides an accurate explanation that they focused on underlying mechanisms and physical properties that produce behavior, which aligns with the answer key's emphasis on processes that cause stimuli to result in behavior.

Score: 1.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

They take the intentional stance by contemplating our behavior in terms of our thoughts and intentions.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the intentional stance instead of the design stance. Evolutionary psychology focuses on the functional purpose and adaptive value of psychological processes (design stance), not on beliefs and desires that drive behavior (intentional stance).

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Specificity means that A causes B if B occurs only after A and not due to any other factors. Consistency implies that A causes B if B always occurs after A. The possibility or logic that the relationship between A and B remains constant across different times and places is considered. A causes B if B directly follows A consistently in the same location, indicating A is the sole cause. Additionally, A causes B if B follows A and it is not the case that C also follows A.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies specificity and explains it as B occurring only after A and not due to other factors, which matches the distinctness heuristic from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies consistency and explains it as B always occurring after A, which matches the answer key exactly.
- Incorrect: The student mentions 'possibility or logic' and consistency across times and places, but does not clearly identify plausibility as common sense making the causal relationship believable.
- Correct: The student mentions A and B occurring consistently in the same location with B directly following A, which captures the contiguity in time and space heuristic.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention or address the similarity in cause and effect heuristic, where A and B superficially resemble each other.

Score: 0.6

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Due to negativity bias and the availability heuristic, we are drawn to emotionally negative content, such as morally outraged posts on social media. The availability heuristic means we judge the likelihood or frequency of an event based on how easily it comes to mind. Since we encounter this negative content more frequently, we tend to overestimate the number of people who are genuinely morally outraged.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias and explains that it draws us to emotionally negative content, including morally outraged posts on social media.
- Correct: The student accurately defines the availability heuristic as judging likelihood or frequency based on how easily examples come to mind.
- Correct: The student successfully connects both biases, explaining that negativity bias increases exposure to outraged content, which through the availability heuristic leads to overestimating the frequency of moral outrage.

Score: 1.0

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

Biology: Items belonging to others may carry different bacteria than your own, which could cause illness if you handle or use them. Psychological: If you dislike the person who previously owned the items, it can make you feel uncomfortable, leading you to avoid using them.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that biological concepts of contagion (bacteria transmission) are being inappropriately applied to psychological/social situations where discomfort with disliked individuals leads to avoidance of their belongings, demonstrating understanding of domain confusion in framework theories.

Score: 1.0

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A delusional conspiracy theory involves a belief in something imagined and impossible, whereas a non-delusional conspiracy theory concerns a scenario that might have actually occurred and could be true.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student focuses on plausibility/possibility rather than the key criteria of irrationality combined with lack of common acceptance. The answer misses that the distinction is based on whether the belief is both irrational AND not commonly accepted, not just whether it's imagined/impossible versus possible.

Score: 0.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

Feelings of being a minority (alienation), belonging to a lower social class, and having low intelligence.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: Feelings of being a minority/alienation is not listed among the cognitive and personality factors in the answer key.
- Incorrect: Belonging to a lower social class is not mentioned in the answer key as one of the factors contributing to conspiratorial thinking.
- Correct: Having low intelligence is correctly identified as one of the factors listed in the answer key.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

The mere exposure effect means that if you see the incorrect answer frequently, it becomes more familiar and easier to recall than the correct one.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the mere exposure effect as the mechanism. The mere exposure effect refers to developing preference for things we're exposed to frequently, not memory confusion. The correct answer involves source amnesia (forgetting the source/context of information) or proactive interference (old incorrect information interfering with new correct information).

Score: 0.0

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

The mere exposure effect refers to the phenomenon where information we encounter more frequently becomes more readily accessible in our minds.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly identifies the mere exposure effect but provides an incorrect definition. They describe accessibility (which relates to availability heuristic) rather than the correct definition of mere exposure as the tendency to prefer things we are familiar with due to repeated exposure.

Score: 0.0

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Yes, because they no longer exhibit a positivity bias and instead have an intense negativity bias. This causes them to inaccurately believe that negative events are more likely to occur, even though the likelihood is not higher compared to individuals without major depressive disorder.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that people with major depressive disorder are less accurate due to negativity bias, when the answer key indicates they are actually more accurate because they have reduced optimism bias. The student's answer directly contradicts the key point about improved accuracy.

Score: 0.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

When the reliability of new sensory information diminishes, prior beliefs have a greater impact on perception.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when sensory information becomes less reliable, prior beliefs have increased influence on perception, which directly matches the core concept in the answer key.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

Pre-conventional: we see rewards as positive and punishment as negative, focusing on our own interests and expecting something in return for our actions. Conventional: we pay attention to others' feelings and aim to avoid causing harm. Post-conventional: we recognize that moral conflicts can exist and take them into account.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the pre-conventional level as focusing on rewards and punishment, and mentions self-interest, which aligns with the answer key's description of obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as paying attention to others' feelings and aiming to avoid harm, which matches the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Incorrect: The student's description of recognizing moral conflicts is too vague and doesn't capture the essence of the post-conventional level, which should focus on abstract principles and values rather than just acknowledging conflicts.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

The results of previous events are more likely to have caused the current event than things that did not occur, leading us to believe that past happenings were more probable and thus more predictable. This plays a role in hindsight bias, making us think events were easier to foresee than they actually were, causing the false impression that we would have anticipated them all along.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student does not clearly define what a causal model is as a coherent narrative of how past events are related. Instead, they focus on causation probability without explaining the structural aspect of causal models.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that causal models contribute to hindsight bias by making past events seem more predictable and inevitable than they actually were, which aligns with the key point about events seeming more inevitable.

Score: 0.5

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

When evaluating our previous likelihood estimates, we cannot ignore information we have recently acquired, meaning that actual outcomes are also considered. This leads to hindsight bias.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that newly learned information cannot be ignored when estimating past likelihood judgments, and accurately connects this to hindsight bias. The answer captures the core mechanism described in the answer key.

Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

optimizing

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student only wrote 'optimizing' which does not describe maximizing as trying to make the best choice. The term is related but lacks the required explanation.
- Incorrect: The student provided no description of satisficing as making a good-enough choice. The answer is completely missing this required element.
- Incorrect: The student did not address the relationship between high neuroticism and maximizing decision style. This part of the question was not answered at all.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

Developing a system that can evaluate exams and provide accurate feedback and grading in a subjective and expert manner could be beneficial, as it eliminates the clinical intuition bias that a human assessor might possess.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement by proposing an automated evaluation system to address the constraint of limited time and resources. They show understanding of assessment challenges by identifying human bias as a potential issue and suggesting technology as a solution for scalable, consistent grading.
