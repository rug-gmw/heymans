## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

System 1 carries out moral reasoning through intuition, which is quick and requires little effort. System 2, on the other hand, approaches moral reasoning by following rules, making it more deliberate.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 involves intuition in moral reasoning, which aligns with the answer key's requirement to identify System 1 as intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 2 involves deliberate, rule-following reasoning, which matches the answer key's requirement to identify System 2 as reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Incorrect: The student does not address which system is more dominant according to Haidt's social-intuitionist model. The answer key requires stating that System 1 is more dominant than System 2.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring refers to the tendency for individuals to establish an initial reference point in their minds and then evaluate subsequent information in relation to that point. The primacy effect means that the first information people receive is the most easily remembered.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as establishing an initial reference point, which aligns with the answer key's description of taking the first piece of information as a starting point.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as the first information being most easily remembered, which matches the answer key's definition of better remembering the first piece of information.
- Incorrect: The student does not address what anchoring and the primacy effect have in common, missing the key point about both representing an overreliance on first information.

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency of individuals to steer clear of losses, while risk aversion describes the preference for obtaining gains with minimal or no risk involved.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes loss aversion as 'steering clear of losses' which misses the key concept that losses are weighted more heavily than equivalent gains. The definition lacks the comparative aspect that is central to loss aversion.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies risk aversion as preferring minimal or no risk, which captures the essence of preferring certainty over uncertainty, though phrased differently than the answer key.

Score: 0.5

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias is the tendency for people to avoid making decisions, often choosing to remain inactive, especially when it comes to their relationships.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly defines impact bias as a tendency to avoid making decisions or remain inactive. Impact bias is actually the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Incorrect: The student does not explain how impact bias could prevent breakups. They don't mention that people overestimate how bad a breakup will make them feel, which is the key mechanism.

Score: 0.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves people making decisions by using the likelihood of past events to estimate the chances of current events occurring.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly defines affective forecasting as using past events to estimate current event probabilities, when it actually refers to predictions about one's own future emotional states.
- Incorrect: The student does not address the importance of affective forecasting in end-of-life decisions or mention the discrepancy between healthy people's predictions and actual preferences when sick.

Score: 0.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

Yes, people generally believe that events with low probabilities can occur, but they tend to assume that events with extremely low probabilities will not happen.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student states people 'believe that events with low probabilities can occur' but doesn't specify that these probabilities are overestimated, which is the key point about probability weighting in prospect theory.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people 'assume that events with extremely low probabilities will not happen,' which aligns with the answer key point about extremely low probabilities being interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 0.5

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

At the pre-prospect stage, loss aversion causes individuals to evaluate decisions more cautiously.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's answer discusses behavioral effects at a 'pre-prospect stage' but does not address what loss aversion reflects in terms of utility within prospect theory itself. The answer key specifically asks about utility representation, where loss aversion means negative utilities are weighted more heavily than positive utilities or that the value function is steeper for losses than gains. The student's response misses this key conceptual point about the mathematical/utility representation of loss aversion.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory suggests that individuals focus on the actual outcomes' values, reflecting system 1 thinking. In contrast, expected utility theory proposes that people take into account both the likelihood of outcomes and their values, which aligns with system 2 thinking.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly describes expected value theory as focusing only on actual outcomes' values, when in fact expected value theory does consider probabilities (EV = probability × value). The answer key point about financial vs non-financial values is not addressed.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that expected utility theory considers probabilities while expected value theory doesn't, when both theories consider probabilities. The answer key point about risk aversion and heuristics/biases is not mentioned.

Score: 0.0

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to people's tendency to steer clear of losses. This leads them to avoid risks that could result in losing something.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that loss aversion leads people to avoid risks and be more risk averse. The correct relationship is that loss aversion can actually decrease risk aversion and make people risk-seeking when they face potential losses, as they become willing to take risks to avoid those losses.

Score: 0.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves the expectation that events will occur with variation. Classical conditioning refers to the belief that events happen simultaneously in time and place. Operant conditioning is the understanding that events occur according to cause and effect and likelihood.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes conditioning as 'expectation that events will occur with variation' which misses the core concept of learning associations through covariation. The answer is vague and doesn't capture the fundamental learning aspect.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that classical conditioning involves events happening 'simultaneously in time and place,' which captures the essence of learning associations when things occur together temporally and spatially.
- Correct: The student describes operant conditioning as understanding 'cause and effect and likelihood,' which adequately captures the concept that actions lead to consequences (rewards or punishments).

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation occurs when a cause-and-effect relationship is assumed between two events, but no actual causation exists. Illusory correlation refers to the perception of a relationship between two events when no real correlation is present.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly distinguishes between illusory causation (assuming causal relationships where none exist) and illusory correlation (perceiving correlations where none exist). While the wording differs from the answer key, the core concepts are accurately captured - illusory causation involves incorrect causal interpretation while illusory correlation involves perceiving non-existent relationships between variables.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

Knowing how the Dutch healthcare system operates is a framework, while knowing the appropriate way to act at a birthday party is a script.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly identifies that understanding the Dutch healthcare system is not a script, but uses the term 'framework' instead of 'schema'. While the conceptual understanding may be present, the specific terminology required by the answer key is not used.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, which matches the answer key's requirement that this represents behavioral knowledge for a specific situation.

Score: 0.5

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Heuristics based on how easily examples come to mind.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: Student did not mention distinctness/specificity - that B follows A but not other events.
- Incorrect: Student did not mention consistency - that B always follows A.
- Incorrect: Student did not mention plausibility - that common sense makes A causing B reasonable.
- Incorrect: Student did not mention contiguity in time and space - that A and B occur simultaneously and in the same location.
- Incorrect: Student did not mention similarity in cause and effect - that A and B superficially resemble each other.

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Confirmation bias is the tendency for individuals to favor information that aligns with their existing beliefs. Hindsight bias is the inclination to believe, after an event has occurred, that it was predictable all along. People tend to trust and believe only the information that supports their expectations, often leading to an overestimation of outcomes.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies confirmation bias instead of negativity bias. While confirmation bias involves favoring information that aligns with existing beliefs, negativity bias specifically refers to the tendency to seek out or place more weight on negative information like morally outraged content.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies hindsight bias instead of availability heuristic. Hindsight bias is about perceiving past events as more predictable than they were, while availability heuristic is about estimating frequency based on how easily examples come to mind.
- Incorrect: The student fails to explain the correct mechanism. They mention trusting supportive information leading to overestimation, but don't describe how negativity bias increases attention to morally outraged content, which then makes such examples more available and leads to overestimation through the availability heuristic.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

The tendency to favor information that supports one's existing beliefs or opinions.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes confirmation bias, which is about favoring information that supports existing beliefs. This does not address how incorrect answers during self-quizzing can interfere with learning through mechanisms like source amnesia, proactive interference, or the continued-influence effect.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

Recency effect

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student answered 'recency effect,' which refers to better recall of items at the end of a list, not the psychological mechanism by which repeated exposure increases preference or perceived truth. The correct answer should be mere exposure effect or illusory-truth effect.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Certainly.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student provided no substantive answer to the question about whether major depressive disorder affects accuracy in predicting negative events. The response 'Certainly' does not address the key point that people with depression are more accurate due to reduced optimism bias.

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

It will cause people to have an inflated sense of their abilities.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's answer about inflated sense of abilities is completely unrelated to the question about how decreased sensory reliability affects the influence of prior beliefs on perception in the ideal-observer model. The correct answer should explain that prior beliefs have greater influence when sensory information is less reliable.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model illustrates the relationships between past and current events, allowing the estimation of the likelihood of current events based on previous ones.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a causal model shows relationships between past events, which aligns with the answer key's definition of a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention hindsight bias or explain how causal models contribute to it by making events seem more inevitable than they actually were.

Score: 0.5

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

The act of learning can increase hindsight bias.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student only states that learning increases hindsight bias but fails to explain the mechanism - that newly learned information cannot be avoided when estimating past likelihood judgments, which is the core explanation required by the answer key.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Individuals with a maximizing decision style usually select the optimal option for a given situation. In contrast, those with a satisficing decision style often choose options that are adequate or appropriate, though not necessarily the best. Maximizing decision style.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as selecting the optimal option, which aligns with 'trying to make the best choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as choosing adequate or appropriate options that are not necessarily the best, which matches 'making a good-enough choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that those high in neuroticism adopt the maximizing decision style, though the answer is incomplete as it only states 'Maximizing decision style' without full explanation.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

Perhaps I can leverage the recency effect by reiterating the message that "The material is important, so please read it," and encourage students to actively interact with the content.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The answer is too brief and superficial. While it mentions the recency effect and encouraging student interaction, it lacks depth and doesn't demonstrate serious engagement with the complex challenge of promoting active learning with limited resources. The response doesn't provide concrete strategies or show understanding of pedagogical approaches that could realistically address the constraints mentioned in the question.
