Grade: 7.5

## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidtâ€™s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

System 1 thinking operates quickly and automatically, driven by emotions and shortcuts like heuristics and biases. In contrast, System 2 thinking is slower and more deliberate, allowing for the reassessment of those biases. In terms of moral reasoning, System 1 corresponds to intuitive judgments that arise rapidly and are shaped by emotions. This intuitive process tends to dominate initially, with people usually sticking to their first impressions until System 2 prompts them to rethink and evaluate the biases involved, leading to more reasoned moral judgments.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies System 1 thinking as driven by emotions and operating through intuitive judgments that arise rapidly, which aligns with the answer key's description of System 1 as intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student accurately describes System 2 thinking as slower, more deliberate, and involving reassessment and evaluation, which corresponds to the answer key's description of System 2 as reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student clearly states that System 1 'tends to dominate initially' and that people 'usually stick to their first impressions,' indicating System 1's dominance over System 2, which matches the answer key requirement.

Score: 1.0

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

Representation bias occurs when we assume that A is B simply because A resembles B, despite statistical evidence indicating that this is unlikely.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student uses 'representation bias' instead of 'representativeness heuristic'. While these terms are related, the answer key specifically asks for the representativeness heuristic.
- Correct: The student correctly explains the core concept - assuming A is B because A resembles B - which captures the essence of how representativeness heuristic works by judging likelihood based on similarity to stereotypes.

Score: 0.5

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring involves relying heavily on the initial information received, and while subsequent information can lead to adjustments, these changes do not always occur. The primacy effect causes us to recall the first information more vividly, leading us to believe it is accurate. Thus, both anchoring and the primacy effect focus on the initial information, assuming its correctness.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as relying heavily on initial information received, which matches the answer key's definition of taking the first piece of information as the starting point.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as causing us to recall the first information more vividly, which aligns with the answer key's definition of better remembering the first piece of information.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both concepts focus on initial information and assume its correctness, which corresponds to the answer key's point about overreliance on the first piece of information.

Score: 1.0

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the idea that people feel more upset by losing something than they feel joy from gaining an equivalent amount. When individuals possess something, they are reluctant to lose it. Risk aversion describes the tendency of people to avoid taking risks when their future is certain. Loss aversion relates to utility, while risk aversion concerns value.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly explains that loss aversion means people feel losses more strongly than equivalent gains, which matches the answer key's definition of weighing losses more heavily than gains.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly defines risk aversion as avoiding risks 'when their future is certain' rather than the preference for certainty over uncertainty. The answer key emphasizes preferring certainty, not avoiding risks when certain.

Score: 0.5

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate how strongly future emotions will affect us. This bias can stop individuals from ending unhappy relationships, as they might believe that a breakup will result in even greater emotional pain down the line.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies impact bias as overestimating future emotional effects, which aligns with the answer key's definition of overestimating the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that impact bias prevents breakups because people overestimate the emotional pain they'll experience, which matches the answer key's point about overestimating how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting refers to the process of anticipating how we will feel in the future. This concept is important in end-of-life decisions because people often express a desire not to continue living when they approach the end of their lives, fearing the severity of illness. However, this is paradoxical, as studies show that individuals tend to be happier at the end of life than expected. Therefore, it is important to consider this when making decisions about end-of-life care.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines affective forecasting as 'the process of anticipating how we will feel in the future,' which captures the essence of predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of the key concept that people's predictions about their preferences when sick (expressing desire not to continue living) may differ from their actual experience (being happier than expected at end of life), which aligns with the answer key's point about the discrepancy between predicted and actual preferences.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

Small probabilities tend to be underestimated, as they are perceived as impossible. There is a difference between just low probabilities and extremely low probabilities, with the latter being significantly more underestimated than the former.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student states that merely low probabilities are underestimated, but according to prospect theory, they are actually overestimated (overweighting of small probabilities).
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that extremely low probabilities are treated differently and are perceived as impossible, which aligns with the answer key.

Score: 0.5

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the concept that losses feel more significant and unpleasant compared to gains due to their much lower perceived value relative to the higher value of gains.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes loss aversion as losses feeling more significant but incorrectly states that losses have 'much lower perceived value relative to the higher value of gains.' The answer key requires understanding that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities, meaning the utility function is steeper for losses than gains - not that losses have lower value, but that they have greater psychological impact per unit.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory centers on making decisions based on the expected values of various options, whereas expected utility theory takes into account additional elements that affect personal preferences. In expected value theory, you multiply the outcome's value by its probability, while in expected utility theory, you multiply the utility by the probability.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory focuses on financial/monetary values while expected utility theory incorporates broader personal preferences and non-financial factors that affect utility.
- Incorrect: The student explains the mathematical calculation difference but does not mention the key behavioral aspect that expected utility theory accounts for risk aversion and behavioral biases while expected value theory does not.

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesnâ€™t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected value theory centers on making decisions by considering the expected values of various options. In contrast, expected utility theory takes into account additional factors that affect subjective feelings alongside these values when making decisions. MAUT is a model that incorporates multiple assumptions within a decision, multiplying each assumption's utility by its importance weight to reach a conclusion. Prospect theory, meanwhile, emphasizes decisions based on gains and losses instead of absolute values.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as focusing on expected values of options, which aligns with the normative model concept and financial outcomes from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes expected utility theory as building on expected value theory but incorporating subjective feelings/factors, which matches the answer key's description of non-financial, subjective utility.
- Correct: The student correctly describes MAUT as incorporating multiple assumptions (attributes) with utility and importance weights, which accurately reflects the multi-attribute utility theory concept from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies prospect theory's focus on gains and losses rather than absolute values, which captures the key behavioral/descriptive nature and the reference point dependency that distinguishes it from expected utility theory.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease peopleâ€™s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Loss aversion is the tendency to weigh losses more heavily than gains. This often results in risk-seeking behavior when faced with the chance to avoid losses, as people tend to choose risks rather than accept definite losses.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion leads to risk-seeking behavior when people face potential losses, which aligns with the key point that loss aversion decreases risk aversion and can make people risk seeking to avoid losses.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning refers to the connection formed between two elements that appear to be related. Classical conditioning involves linking two stimuli because they occur close together in time and place. Operant conditioning, on the other hand, is the connection between a behavior and its outcome, where actions can result in either a reward or a punishment.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as forming connections/associations between related elements, which aligns with the key concept of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as linking two stimuli that occur close together in time and place, which matches the answer key's description of learning to associate things that happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as the connection between behavior and outcome, where actions result in rewards or punishments, which directly corresponds to the answer key's definition of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation is mistakenly believing that one event caused a particular result, such as assuming a certain medicine cured a patient. Illusory correlation is the mistaken belief that two or more factors are related or tend to occur together when, in reality, they are not connected.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly distinguishes that illusory causation involves incorrectly assuming a causal relationship (mistakenly believing one event caused another) while illusory correlation involves perceiving a relationship between variables that are not actually connected. The definitions align with the answer key's distinction between misinterpreting correlation as causation versus perceiving non-existent correlations.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to â€˜properlyâ€™ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

The Dutch healthcare system serves as an example of a schema, illustrating the types of systems present within a particular culture. In contrast, how to act appropriately at a birthday party represents a script, which refers to the typical social behaviors, communication patterns, and values expected in specific everyday situations like a birthday celebration.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the Dutch healthcare system as a schema and provides an accurate explanation that it represents knowledge about types of systems within a culture, which aligns with schemas being knowledge structures about relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies birthday party behavior as a script and accurately explains it as referring to typical social behaviors and expectations in specific situations, which matches the definition of scripts as social schemas for situational behavior.

Score: 1.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

When examining how stimuli prompt behavior, behaviorists employed the intentional stance. This approach involves interpreting situations by considering behavior, desires, and thoughts, aiming to understand why certain behaviors occur and how stimuli affect desires and actions.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the intentional stance, which focuses on beliefs, desires, and mental states. Behaviorists actually adopted the physical stance because they rejected studying mental phenomena and instead focused on observable stimulus-response mechanisms and the physical processes that cause stimuli to produce behaviors.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

Evolutionary psychologists take the design stance because it emphasizes functionalism, focusing on the purpose or usefulness when examining something.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance and provides an accurate explanation that it focuses on function/purpose/usefulness, which aligns with the answer key's explanation that they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

The first heuristic, distinctness, indicates that event A is the sole cause of B, with no other factors involved. The second heuristic, consistency, means that event A invariably leads to B. It must be plausible, meaning that based on what we know, it is feasible for event A to cause B. The cause and effect must be contiguous in space and time, meaning event A occurs before B and happens nearby, allowing A to cause B. The final heuristic, similarity, suggests that the event and its cause share similarities.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies distinctness and explains it as A being the sole cause of B with no other factors involved, which captures the essence of specificity in the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies consistency and explains it as A invariably leading to B, which matches the answer key's explanation that B always follows A.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies plausibility and explains it as being feasible based on what we know, which aligns with the answer key's mention of common sense making causation plausible.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies contiguity in space and time, explaining that A occurs before B and nearby, which matches the answer key's requirement for same time and location.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies similarity and explains that the event and cause share similarities, which corresponds to the answer key's similarity in cause and effect heuristic.

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Confirmation bias and negativity bias both play a role. Negativity bias causes social media platforms to show us more negative content than positive, resulting in an abundance of morally outraged posts and making us think that many people are upset. Confirmation bias drives us to look for information that supports our existing beliefs, further strengthening the idea that a large number of people are morally outraged.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias and explains how it causes us to see more negative/morally outraged content on social media, which aligns with the answer key's explanation of negativity bias.
- Incorrect: The student identifies confirmation bias instead of the availability heuristic as the second bias. While confirmation bias is related, the answer key specifically requires the availability heuristic as the mechanism for overestimating frequency based on easily recalled examples.
- Incorrect: The student doesn't explain the specific mechanism of how negativity bias and availability heuristic work together. They mention confirmation bias reinforcing beliefs rather than the availability heuristic's role in frequency estimation based on ease of recall.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

Magical contagion combines symptoms from various areas, resulting in an error that crosses different domains. Personal characteristics are attributed to objects, but our common-sense understanding tells us this cannot happen.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that magical contagion involves applying concepts from one domain (biological/physical contagion) to another domain (social/psychological) where it doesn't logically belong, demonstrating understanding of cross-domain framework theory errors.

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A delusional conspiracy theory is one that is believed by a smaller group of people and is not broadly accepted, unlike a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student only mentions the 'not commonly accepted' criterion but fails to identify that a delusional conspiracy theory must also be an 'irrational belief.' The answer is incomplete as it only addresses one of the two required distinguishing characteristics.

Score: 0.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

Intelligence is considered a personality trait because it affects the mental capacity to critically evaluate conspiratorial ideas. Having strong analytical skills reduces the likelihood of believing in conspiracy theories.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies low intelligence as a factor contributing to conspiratorial thinking, though they frame it positively by discussing how intelligence reduces conspiracy beliefs.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies analytical thinking as a factor, noting that strong analytical skills reduce conspiracy beliefs, which aligns with the answer key point about low analytical thinking contributing to conspiratorial thinking.
- Incorrect: The student only provides two factors (intelligence and analytical thinking) when the question asks for three factors from the lecture.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you donâ€™t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Because of the availability heuristic, encountering your incorrect answer may cause you to recall it later without clearly remembering whether it was right or wrong, leading to a faulty reconstruction of your thoughts.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the availability heuristic as the mechanism. While they correctly describe the general phenomenon of recalling incorrect information without remembering its accuracy status, the availability heuristic refers to judging likelihood based on ease of recall, not forgetting the source of information. The correct mechanism is source amnesia, where one forgets that their own answer was incorrect and mistakes it for the correct answer.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

Simple familiarity through repeated exposure

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the mere exposure effect, which is the psychological mechanism where repeated exposure to something increases familiarity and preference for it. This directly matches the answer key's concept of 'mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with.'

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Many individuals who estimate the likelihood of negative events occurring to them tend to have a positivity bias, causing them to focus on the low probability of being affected. However, major depressive disorder can eliminate this positivity bias or turn it into a negativity bias, which can negatively impact their predictions. As a result, their forecasts may become less accurate.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly identifies that depression affects optimism bias but reaches the wrong conclusion. They state that depression makes predictions 'less accurate' when the answer key indicates depression actually makes people 'more accurate' by reducing overly optimistic tendencies.

Score: 0.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

The impact of previous beliefs on perception grows stronger as the trustworthiness of sensory information diminishes. When the evidence you observe is uncertain, you tend to rely more on your prior beliefs, causing your perception to align more closely with those beliefs while giving less weight to the sensory input.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that prior beliefs have greater influence on perception when sensory information is less reliable. They demonstrate understanding of the inverse relationship between sensory reliability and prior belief influence, and explain the mechanism clearly with appropriate terminology.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You donâ€™t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other peopleâ€™s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

The pre-conventional stage centers on personal interests and what benefits oneself. The conventional stage emphasizes the perspective of others, considering how they view you and what you can contribute to them. The post-conventional stage prioritizes the greater good of the world, where conflicting values may arise, leading to selecting the most optimal solution.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the pre-conventional level as focusing on personal interests and self-benefit, which aligns with the answer key's description of obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as emphasizing others' perspectives and considering how others view you, which matches the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the post-conventional level as prioritizing the greater good and dealing with conflicting values to find optimal solutions, which aligns with the answer key's description of focusing on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model of past events can make us believe that those events were more unavoidable than they actually were, which fuels hindsight bias by causing us to think the outcome was clear from the beginning, leading to the feeling that we always predicted it.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student does not explicitly define what a causal model is - they jump directly to its effects without explaining that it's a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student correctly explains how causal models contribute to hindsight bias by making events seem more unavoidable/inevitable than they were, and connects this to the 'I knew it all along' feeling.

Score: 0.5

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

We gain knowledge from past events, and this knowledge affects how we interpret them. Therefore, when reflecting on the past, we cannot do so without the influence of what we have since learned, which can cause us to believe the outcome was more predictable than it actually was. This phenomenon is known as the curse of knowledge and results in hindsight bias.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly explains that newly learned information cannot be avoided when estimating past likelihood judgments, leading to hindsight bias. They also correctly identify this as the curse of knowledge, demonstrating a complete understanding of the concept.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing refers to the tendency of individuals to look for the best possible choice and outcome. In contrast, satisficing involves making decisions that are adequate or satisfactory. People who score high in the personality trait of neuroticism are more likely to use a maximizing approach when making decisions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as looking for the best possible choice and outcome, which aligns with the answer key's definition of 'trying to make the best choice.'
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as making decisions that are adequate or satisfactory, which matches the answer key's definition of 'making a good-enough choice.'
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people high in neuroticism are more likely to use a maximizing approach, which directly matches the answer key's statement.

Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

You might suggest using the Heymans tool, which provides students with targeted feedback on the questions they need. This encourages students to interact more deeply with the content by asking questions, while the AI generates quizzes to assess their understanding. It also eliminates the need for teacher involvement.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement by proposing a specific technological solution (Heymans tool) that directly addresses the challenge of promoting active engagement while minimizing time-intensive grading. The answer shows understanding of the constraint (limited time/resources) and offers a practical approach using AI-generated quizzes and targeted feedback to achieve the learning objectives without requiring personalized teacher involvement.

Score: 1.0
