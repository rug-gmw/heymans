## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

In this model, emotional thinking from System 1 plays a key role in shaping our moral intuition, relying primarily on our gut feelings rather than logical analysis, following the affect-as-information principle. When conditions permit—such as having enough time to think, encountering conflicting moral intuitions, or being motivated to reason—moral reasoning, associated with System 2, can occur. However, most of the time, it mainly functions to rationalize our initial moral intuition after the fact.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies System 1 as emotional thinking that shapes moral intuition and relies on gut feelings, which aligns with the answer key's description of System 1 as intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies System 2 as moral reasoning and logical analysis, which matches the answer key's description of System 2 as reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student clearly indicates System 1 dominance by stating that System 2 reasoning occurs only under specific conditions and 'most of the time' functions to rationalize initial moral intuitions, demonstrating that System 1 (emotion/intuition) is more dominant.

Score: 1.0

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

The representativeness heuristic occurs when our mental image of a social group, such as a stereotype, leads us to assume that a person who fits that image is probably part of that group, while disregarding the real likelihood of meeting someone from that group (ignoring the base rate).

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process in this scenario.
- Correct: The student provides an accurate explanation of the representativeness heuristic, describing how stereotypes lead us to categorize people based on similarity to our mental image of a group, and even adds the important detail about ignoring base rates.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring describes how a specific piece of information can affect individuals' estimates and perceptions, causing their judgments to lean toward a particular reference point known as the anchor. Similarly, there is a pronounced primacy effect in forming impressions, where initial information heavily impacts people's views of a person or scenario. These ideas are components of a belief-adjustment model and tend to prevail when adjustments to judgments are inadequate, which occurs frequently.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as involving a reference point that affects judgments and estimates, which captures the essence of taking the first piece of information as a starting point.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as initial information heavily impacting people's views, which aligns with the tendency to better remember the first piece of information.
- Correct: The student recognizes that both concepts involve overreliance on initial information by describing how initial information heavily impacts judgments in both cases, consistent with the commonality of overreliance on first information.

Score: 1.0

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion means that individuals place greater importance on avoiding losses than on achieving gains. Risk aversion suggests that people favor certainty when making decisions. As a result, people may take risks to prevent losses but act cautiously when facing potential gains.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion means individuals place greater importance on avoiding losses than on achieving gains, which aligns with the answer key's definition of weighing losses more heavily than gains.
- Correct: The student accurately defines risk aversion as people favoring certainty when making decisions, which matches the answer key's description of preferring certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 1.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias is a consistent mistake where individuals exaggerate how much future events will affect their emotions. For example, someone may avoid ending a troubled relationship because they overpredict the emotional distress of a breakup, failing to consider how quickly emotions tend to diminish over time.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as exaggerating how much future events will affect emotions, which aligns with the answer key's definition of overestimating the impact of future events on future feelings.
- Correct: The student accurately explains how impact bias prevents breakups by stating people 'overpredict the emotional distress of a breakup,' which matches the answer key's point about overestimating how bad a breakup will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting refers to the attempt to predict how future events will influence one's emotions. While individuals can generally judge if their feelings will be positive or negative, they often struggle to accurately assess how long and how strongly these emotions will last. In decisions made at the end of life, like those involving dementia, it is crucial for people to make choices for their future selves when they can think as rationally as possible, even though intuitive, fast thinking (system 1) may lead them to overestimate the impact their emotions will have later, due to impact bias.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines affective forecasting as predicting future emotional states, though they provide more detail about the accuracy challenges involved.
- Incorrect: The student discusses impact bias and rational decision-making but doesn't address the key point about healthy people predicting they'd prefer death when sick, but potentially changing their preference when actually ill.

Score: 0.5

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

Prospect theory suggests that individuals often downplay the likelihood of rare events. Very small chances, even in decisions involving significant risk, are perceived as essentially impossible.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student states that individuals 'downplay the likelihood of rare events' which contradicts the answer key that merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that very small chances are 'perceived as essentially impossible' which aligns with the answer key point about extremely low probabilities being interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 0.5

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion describes the tendency of individuals to give more importance to losses than is justified by a rational assessment that would weigh gains and losses equally. This leads to a departure from ideal decision-making, with people displaying non-linear preferences based on utility. In situations involving loss aversion, the way options are presented can influence how potential losses are perceived. Even when two options have similar utility, their framing may cause people to irrationally perceive one as more likely to result in losses.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes loss aversion as a general behavioral tendency and discusses framing effects, but does not specifically explain how loss aversion is reflected in the utility function of prospect theory - namely that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities or that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory is useful only for financial choices that can be quantified in monetary terms, whereas expected utility theory considers the personal value individuals assign to options and their results. Additionally, expected value theory ignores risk aversion and its influence on decisions, while expected utility theory incorporates this factor.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory deals with monetary/financial quantification while expected utility theory considers personal values assigned to options, which aligns with the distinction between financial vs non-financial values.
- Correct: The student accurately states that expected value theory ignores risk aversion while expected utility theory incorporates it, which matches the answer key's point about expected utility theory considering risk aversion as a heuristic/bias factor.

Score: 1.0

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected value theory is a prescriptive framework for selecting among options based on their financial outcomes. Expected utility theory similarly provides a prescriptive approach for making decisions involving various outcomes with personal subjective values. Both theories presume complete knowledge of expected utilities and probabilities, flawless calculation abilities, and do not consider heuristics or cognitive biases. Multi-attribute utility theory is another normative model that evaluates different choices by assigning distinct weights and utilities to their possible results. In contrast, prospect theory is a descriptive model that accounts for heuristics, consistent biases, and the ways people typically perceive probabilities during decision-making. It also assumes that individuals evaluate outcomes relative to a reference point, focusing on gains and losses rather than absolute values.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as a prescriptive/normative framework for selecting among options based on financial outcomes, which aligns with the answer key's description of a normative model with financial outcomes and probabilities.
- Correct: The student accurately describes expected utility theory as a prescriptive approach for decisions involving outcomes with personal subjective values, which matches the answer key's explanation that it's like expected value theory but with subjective utility rather than just financial outcomes.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies multi-attribute utility theory as a normative model that evaluates choices by assigning weights and utilities to different attributes/results, which corresponds to the answer key's description of multiple attributes with utilities and weights.
- Correct: The student accurately describes prospect theory as a descriptive model that accounts for heuristics and biases in decision-making, which aligns with the answer key's characterization as a descriptive behavioral model similar to expected utility theory but considering heuristics and biases.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Individuals tend to avoid risks when significant gains are at stake, but they are more inclined to take risks when facing potential losses. Since people often exaggerate the impact of losses, they are more prone to risk-taking, which also depends on how certain those losses are perceived to be.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people become more inclined to take risks when facing potential losses, which demonstrates understanding that loss aversion can decrease risk aversion and make people risk-seeking. The answer captures the key concept that loss aversion leads to risk-seeking behavior in the domain of losses.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning is a type of learning where specific stimuli are linked to help anticipate future events. Classical conditioning involves learning by connecting stimuli that occur together in time and space. Operant conditioning involves learning by linking behaviors with rewards or punishments, making those behaviors more or less likely to be repeated.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as a type of learning involving associations, which aligns with the answer key's definition of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as learning by connecting stimuli that occur together in time and space, which matches the answer key's explanation.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning by linking behaviors with rewards or punishments, which corresponds to the answer key's description of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

An illusory correlation is a false connection between variables, whereas illusory causation involves a genuine correlation between variables that are not directly cause-and-effect related but vary together because of an outside factor (a confounding variable).

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly defines illusory causation as involving a genuine correlation with a confounding variable, when it actually refers to misinterpreting any correlation as causation. The definition of illusory correlation as a false connection is correct, but the overall distinction between the two concepts is not accurately captured.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

Concerning the Dutch healthcare system question, a schema is outlined as a framework that helps individuals gain a deeper understanding of Dutch culture by linking various knowledge domains, including healthcare, to form a comprehensive view. A script, on the other hand, is a type of schema related to social scenarios, like a Dutch birthday party, where there are culturally appropriate behaviors to follow.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that understanding the Dutch healthcare system is a schema and provides an appropriate explanation that it involves linking knowledge domains to form understanding, which aligns with schemas being about knowledge and relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that knowing how to behave at a Dutch birthday party is a script and accurately explains that scripts are social schemas involving culturally appropriate behaviors in specific situations.

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

These behaviorists embraced a more mechanical perspective, viewing emotions as outcomes generated by specific processes activated by stimuli, and thus as effects of stimuli impacting particular brain structures.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes a mechanical perspective focusing on brain structures and processes, which sounds more like the design stance. The answer key specifies that behaviorists adopted the physical stance because they focused on stimulus-behavior causation, but the student's description of 'processes activated by stimuli' and 'brain structures' suggests a higher level of analysis than the purely physical stance that behaviorists actually used.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

Evolutionary psychologists take a functional approach, explaining the advantages of ingroup favoritism over extended periods and throughout evolutionary history. They infer the benefits of this social behavior by linking it to its positive impact on survival.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly identifies that evolutionary psychologists take a functional approach and explains the evolutionary benefits, but fails to specifically identify Dennett's 'design stance' as requested in the question. The answer describes what evolutionary psychologists do without connecting it to Dennett's framework of stances/levels of analysis.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Distinctness refers to identifying whether A is the sole cause of B or if other factors can also produce B. Plausibility means that, given what we know about B, it is reasonable to believe that A could cause it. Contiguity in space and time indicates that B occurs immediately as A takes place. Consistency in cause-and-effect means that A produces the same level of B each time it occurs.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies distinctness and provides an accurate explanation that A is the sole cause of B, which aligns with the answer key's concept of B following A but not other events.
- Incorrect: The student fails to mention consistency as a separate heuristic. While they mention 'consistency in cause-and-effect' later, they don't identify it as one of the five main heuristics in the proper context.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies plausibility and provides an appropriate explanation about it being reasonable to believe A could cause B based on what we know, matching the answer key's common sense criterion.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies contiguity in space and time, explaining that B occurs immediately as A takes place, which aligns with the answer key's requirement of same time and location.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention similarity in cause and effect as one of the five heuristics. They only provide four heuristics total instead of the required five.

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

We often overjudge how many individuals produce morally outraged content due to the availability heuristic. We make an assumption that since we encounter and recall more negative content (availability-by-number), there must be a larger number of people holding these morally outraged opinions. Additionally, negativity bias influences this perception because we are more inclined to engage with such content, which leads algorithms to show us even more negative material, creating an echo chamber that doesn't necessarily represent the widespread opinion on the issue.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias and explains that we are more inclined to engage with negative/morally outraged content, which aligns with the answer key's definition of negativity bias as seeking out or placing more weight on negative information.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the availability heuristic and explains that we make assumptions about frequency based on what we encounter and recall more easily, which matches the answer key's definition of estimating frequency based on ease of recall.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of how these biases work together - negativity bias causes us to engage more with outraged content, which through algorithms increases our exposure, and availability heuristic then leads us to overestimate prevalence based on this increased exposure. This captures the mechanistic relationship described in the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

In this case, practical and widely accepted medical guidelines related to viral infections are mistakenly used to interpret a social context. This mix-up leads our inherent biases to make us believe someone is contagious simply because we dislike them, despite this conclusion being illogical.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that biological concepts of contagion are being misapplied to social situations. They recognize this as a domain confusion where medical/biological frameworks are inappropriately used in social contexts, which aligns with the answer key's point about biological domain concepts being incorrectly applied to the social domain.

Score: 1.0

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

The key distinction lies in whether a belief is culturally and socially accepted at a particular place and time. A delusional conspiracy theory is an irrational idea that society rejects and disapproves of, whereas a non-delusional conspiracy theory may be a widely accepted perspective on a subject that people lack full understanding of.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that the distinction between delusional and non-delusional conspiracy theories depends on both irrationality and social acceptance. They accurately capture that delusional theories are both irrational and socially rejected, while non-delusional theories have broader acceptance, which aligns with the answer key's criteria.

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

The following cognitive and personality traits are positively linked to conspiratorial thinking: perceiving patterns in random events, exhibiting narcissistic tendencies, and assigning intentionality where none exists.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'perceiving patterns in random events' which matches 'seeing patterns in randomness' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'exhibiting narcissistic tendencies' which matches 'being narcissistic' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'assigning intentionality where none exists' which matches 'attributing agency where it does not exist' from the answer key.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Confusing these wrong answers with the correct one can hinder learning due to source amnesia, a condition where the context in which information was acquired is forgotten.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies source amnesia as the psychological mechanism and accurately explains that it involves forgetting the context (that the answer was incorrect) which can lead to confusing wrong answers with correct ones, directly addressing the core concept from the answer key.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

The mere exposure effect refers to the tendency for individuals to favor things they are most familiar with.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the mere exposure effect and accurately describes it as the tendency to favor things that are familiar, which directly matches the answer key's explanation of mere exposure as the tendency to prefer things we are familiar with.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Individuals with major depressive disorder may be better at making predictions compared to typical individuals who tend to display irrational optimism and a positivity bias, often underestimating the chances of negative events affecting them. Those with MDD might adjust their beliefs about situations more precisely, taking into account both positive and negative information without preference. However, their pronounced negativity bias can lead them to overestimate the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes, placing excessive emphasis on negative possibilities.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people with major depressive disorder are more accurate at making predictions about negative events compared to non-depressed individuals, and accurately explains this is due to reduced optimistic bias in depressed individuals. While the student also mentions potential overestimation due to negativity bias, the core concept that MDD leads to greater accuracy in risk prediction is clearly understood and explained.

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

When sensory information becomes less reliable and provides inadequate evidence for updating beliefs, our perception tends to lean more heavily on our existing prior beliefs.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when sensory information becomes less reliable, perception relies more heavily on prior beliefs, which directly matches the key concept in the answer key.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

Pre-conventional level – centered on oneself; actions causing negative consequences are seen as morally wrong, while those benefiting the individual are viewed as morally right. Conventional level – centered on the opinions of others, judging what is good or bad based on societal standards. Post-conventional level – highlights universal moral principles and recognizes that multiple moral values can exist simultaneously and may sometimes conflict.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the pre-conventional level as self-centered, focusing on avoiding negative consequences and gaining personal benefits, which aligns with the answer key's description of obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as being centered on others' opinions and societal standards, which matches the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the post-conventional level as highlighting universal moral principles and recognizing conflicting moral values, which aligns with the answer key's description of focusing on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model is a mental framework that describes how individuals seek out causes linked to an outcome in order to achieve a sense of mental ease when understanding that outcome.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes a causal model as a 'mental framework' for seeking causes, but fails to capture that it is specifically a coherent narrative of how past events are related to each other.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention hindsight bias at all or explain how causal models make events seem more inevitable than they actually were, which is the key connection to hindsight bias.

Score: 0.0

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Because the information we learn is more accessible, the availability heuristic and the curse of knowledge make it simpler to believe that an event was more predictable than it truly was, since the actual outcome is easier to recall compared to other possible outcomes.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that newly learned information cannot be avoided when estimating past likelihood judgments, and specifically mentions the curse of knowledge. They also provide a good explanation of the mechanism through accessibility and availability heuristic, showing understanding of how hindsight bias operates.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

These decision-making approaches are linked to personality characteristics. Maximizing involves striving to select the optimal option, whereas satisficing means choosing an option that is satisfactory or adequate. Individuals with high levels of neuroticism tend to prefer a maximizing style when making decisions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as 'striving to select the optimal option' which aligns with 'trying to make the best choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as 'choosing an option that is satisfactory or adequate' which matches 'making a good-enough choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that individuals with high neuroticism tend to prefer a maximizing decision style, which directly matches the answer key.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

I would focus my approach on statistical forecasts derived from existing empirical data about which types of assessments generate the most engagement. I would integrate this with clinical insights and experimentally try out various evaluation methods to observe student reactions and involvement with the material. Additionally, I would create a survey to gather students’ preferences regarding examinations, believing that addressing their needs and desires will lead to greater engagement.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement by proposing a systematic, evidence-based approach that includes statistical analysis of assessment effectiveness, experimental testing of methods, and student feedback collection. The answer shows thoughtful consideration of the challenge and provides concrete strategies for increasing engagement while working within resource constraints.
