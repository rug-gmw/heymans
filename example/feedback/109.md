## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

In this model, our reasoning primarily relies on System 1 thinking, while System 2 thinking is used afterward to justify our moral judgments. System 1 is the main system driving moral reasoning in this framework.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student does not explicitly define what System 1 thinking refers to (intuitions/emotions) in Haidt's model.
- Incorrect: The student does not explicitly define what System 2 thinking refers to (reasoning/rational thought/deliberation) in Haidt's model.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 is the main/dominant system in moral reasoning according to Haidt's social-intuitionist model.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

This illustrates the representativeness heuristic, which suggests that we judge the likelihood of an event by how closely an example resembles that event.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process in this scenario.
- Correct: The student provides an accurate explanation of the representativeness heuristic, describing how we judge likelihood based on resemblance, which captures the essence of estimating category membership based on similarity to stereotypes.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring refers to the concept that the initial piece of information encountered influences how we assess subsequent evidence. The primacy effect describes the tendency to remember the first items in a sequence more clearly. Both concepts share the focus on the impact of information presented at the beginning.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as the influence of initial information on subsequent assessments, which aligns with the answer key's description of taking the first piece of information as a starting point.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as the tendency to remember first items in a sequence more clearly, which matches the answer key's definition of better remembering the first piece of information.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both concepts share a focus on the impact of information presented at the beginning, which corresponds to the answer key's point about overreliance on first information.

Score: 1.0

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Risk aversion refers to the preference for safer choices instead of taking risks, while loss aversion is the overall inclination to avoid experiencing losses.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes loss aversion as 'inclination to avoid experiencing losses' but misses the key concept that losses are weighted more heavily than equivalent gains. The answer doesn't capture the asymmetric valuation aspect.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies risk aversion as preferring safer choices over risky ones, which aligns with the answer key's description of preferring certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 0.5

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias refers to the common mistake of exaggerating the emotional impact that future events or choices will have on us. For example, when it comes to ending relationships, individuals may avoid breaking up because they expect to experience greater emotional distress afterward than they truly would.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as exaggerating the emotional impact of future events, which aligns with the answer key's definition of overestimating the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Correct: The student accurately explains how impact bias prevents breakups by stating people avoid breaking up because they expect greater emotional distress than they would actually experience, which matches the answer key's point about overestimating how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves predicting how future events might impact our emotions. It is crucial in end-of-life decisions because our expectations of how someone will feel about a situation may not accurately represent their true emotional experience.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies affective forecasting as predicting future emotional states/impacts, which aligns with the key point about predictions of future emotional state.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of the importance by noting that expectations may not match true emotional experience, which captures the essence of healthy people's predictions about dying when sick versus actual preferences when sick.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

People often overrate small chances, but when probabilities are extremely low, they are frequently undervalued and seen as impossible.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people 'overrate small chances,' which aligns with the answer key point that merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Correct: The student accurately states that extremely low probabilities 'are frequently undervalued and seen as impossible,' which matches the answer key point about extremely low probabilities being interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

According to prospect theory, individuals consistently misjudge the value of attributes, perceiving losses as more harmful than gains of the same amount are beneficial.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion means losses are perceived as more harmful than equivalent gains are beneficial, which reflects the core concept that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory considers only monetary factors, whereas expected utility theory incorporates both monetary and non-monetary factors. Expected utility theory evaluates choices based on utility, while expected value theory assesses them based on monetary amounts.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory deals only with monetary/financial factors while expected utility theory incorporates both monetary and non-monetary factors, which matches the first point in the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student mentions that expected utility theory evaluates based on utility while expected value theory uses monetary amounts, but fails to address the key distinction about risk aversion and heuristics/biases that is specified in the answer key.

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

The behavioural life cycle describes how individuals mentally divide their wealth into separate accounts to guide their financial decisions. The expected value model forecasts how people evaluate the anticipated outcome of various financial choices to select the best one. The expected utility model incorporates both monetary and non-monetary factors to determine the option that provides the greatest overall utility. The multi-attribute-utility model considers multiple variables, each with distinct utility and significance, to identify the option with the highest utility.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes 'behavioural life cycle' instead of expected value theory. Expected value theory involves choosing options based on probability-weighted financial outcomes, not mental accounting of wealth.
- Correct: The student correctly describes expected value model as evaluating anticipated outcomes of financial choices, which aligns with the normative model involving probabilistic financial outcomes.
- Correct: The student correctly explains expected utility model as incorporating both monetary and non-monetary factors for utility maximization, matching the answer key's description of subjective utility beyond just financial outcomes.
- Correct: The student accurately describes multi-attribute utility model as considering multiple variables with distinct utility and significance, which corresponds to the answer key's explanation of multiple attributes with utilities and weights.

Score: 0.75

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Since individuals strive to prevent losses, they may become more willing to take risks when the possibility of losing is emphasized.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion makes people more willing to take risks when trying to avoid losses, which demonstrates understanding that loss aversion can decrease risk aversion and make people risk-seeking.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves learning through noticing regular patterns between two factors. In classical conditioning, a neutral stimulus becomes capable of eliciting a response after being repeatedly paired with a stimulus that naturally triggers that response. In contrast, operant conditioning focuses on forming connections between actions and their consequences, such as rewards or punishments.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as learning through patterns/associations between factors, which aligns with the key concept of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as pairing stimuli that occur together, which matches the answer key's explanation of learning to associate things that happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning connections between actions and consequences (rewards/punishments), which directly corresponds to the answer key's definition.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation occurs when people believe that two events have a cause-and-effect relationship, even though they only happen to vary together. In contrast, illusory correlation is perceiving a connection between things that are actually completely unrelated.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly distinguishes between illusory causation (incorrectly inferring causation from correlation - 'believe that two events have a cause-and-effect relationship, even though they only happen to vary together') and illusory correlation (perceiving correlation where none exists - 'perceiving a connection between things that are actually completely unrelated'). The explanation accurately captures both concepts.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

A schema refers to an outline of general knowledge that helps us predict what to anticipate in a given scenario, such as the Dutch healthcare system. In contrast, a script describes the typical sequence of events in a specific social context, like the expected behavior at a birthday party.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the Dutch healthcare system as a schema and provides an accurate explanation that schemas involve general knowledge structures that help predict what to expect in scenarios.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies birthday party behavior as a script and accurately explains that scripts describe typical sequences of events in specific social contexts.

Score: 1.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

Behaviourists took the physical perspective because they concentrated on the bodily processes that produce behaviour.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that behaviorists adopted the physical stance and provides an accurate explanation that they focused on bodily processes that produce behavior, which aligns with the answer key's emphasis on processes causing stimulus-behavior relationships.

Score: 1.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

They take the design stance by viewing human psychology through the lens of what humans are evolutionarily designed to perform.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the design stance and provides an accurate explanation that evolutionary psychologists view psychology in terms of what humans are designed to do evolutionarily, which aligns with the functional perspective described in the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Distinctiveness indicates whether B occurs exclusively after A or if B can follow other events as well. Consistency concerns the regularity with which B follows A. Temporal order means that B happens only after A has taken place. Contiguity in time and space addresses whether A and B occur close together in time and location. Consensus refers to whether A is also followed by events besides B.

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies distinctiveness and explains it as B occurring exclusively after A, which matches the answer key's concept of specificity.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies consistency and explains it as regularity with which B follows A, matching the answer key.
- Incorrect: Student mentions 'temporal order' instead of plausibility. While temporal order is related to causation, it doesn't match the answer key's plausibility heuristic about common sense.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies contiguity in time and space and provides an accurate explanation matching the answer key.
- Incorrect: Student mentions 'consensus' about A being followed by other events, but this doesn't match the answer key's 'similarity in cause and effect' heuristic about superficial resemblance.

Score: 0.6

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Negativity bias causes us to focus on negative emotional information. Due to the availability heuristic, this information becomes more readily accessible in our memory, making us think that cases of moral outrage happen more often than they actually do.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias and explains it as focusing on negative emotional information, which aligns with the answer key's description of seeking out or placing more weight on negative information like morally outraged content.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the availability heuristic and demonstrates understanding that it involves estimating frequency based on how readily accessible examples are in memory, which matches the answer key's definition.
- Correct: The student successfully connects the two biases, explaining how negativity bias makes negative information more accessible, which then leads the availability heuristic to cause overestimation of moral outrage frequency. This captures the causal relationship described in the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

Framework theories are everyday explanations we use to understand the world, but they do not apply to all areas of knowledge. In this instance, the understanding of diseases spreading via physical contact is wrongly applied to the realm of personality traits.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that biological contagion concepts (diseases spreading via physical contact) are being inappropriately applied to a different domain (personality traits/social realm), which matches the answer key's requirement to explain how contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social/psychological domain.

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

Conspiracy theories are considered delusional when they rely on alleged evidence that starkly contradicts commonly accepted notions of reasonableness, while a non-delusional conspiracy is grounded in possible evidence that appears credible according to general criteria.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that delusional conspiracy theories contradict commonly accepted standards of reasonableness/evidence, while non-delusional ones have credible grounding. This captures the key distinction between irrational beliefs that lack common acceptance versus those with rational basis.

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

Having narcissistic traits, identifying as male, and favoring straightforward explanations over intricate ones.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies narcissistic traits as a factor contributing to conspiratorial thinking, which matches 'being narcissistic' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies gender as a factor by mentioning 'identifying as male,' which corresponds to 'being a man' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the preference for simple explanations by stating 'favoring straightforward explanations over intricate ones,' which matches 'believing in simple explanations for complex events' from the answer key.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Due to source confusion, we might store the wrong answer in our memory but lose track of the fact that it was incorrect. As a result, when the same question comes up again, we may mistakenly retrieve the incorrect answer and believe it to be right.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies source confusion (equivalent to source amnesia) as the mechanism, accurately explains how incorrect answers can be stored without the context that they were wrong, and properly describes how this leads to mistakenly retrieving and believing the incorrect answer to be correct.

Score: 1.0

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

Restating the same points repeatedly gradually increases their familiarity to listeners. Because individuals tend to favor things that feel familiar, this can cause the messages to become more appealing to them as time goes on.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that repetition increases familiarity and that people tend to favor familiar things, which accurately describes the mere exposure effect mechanism from the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

No, individuals with major depressive disorder generally assess the likelihood of negative events occurring to them similarly to those without the disorder.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly identifies that MDD does not make people less accurate, but fails to recognize that people with MDD are actually MORE accurate due to reduced optimism bias. The student states they assess likelihood 'similarly' rather than more accurately.

Score: 0.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

As the trustworthiness of sensory input lessens, your perception tends to align more with your existing beliefs, even though your certainty in those beliefs also weakens.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that as sensory reliability decreases, perception aligns more with prior beliefs/expectations. The additional point about certainty weakening shows deeper understanding but doesn't contradict the key concept.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

The pre-conventional stage of moral development focuses on self-interest and personal gain. The conventional stage centers on maintaining social order and conformity. The post-conventional stage involves reasoning guided by universal ethical standards, beyond societal rules.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the pre-conventional level as focused on self-interest and personal gain, which aligns with the answer key's description of obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as centering on maintaining social order and conformity, which matches the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly describes the post-conventional level as involving reasoning guided by universal ethical standards beyond societal rules, which aligns with the answer key's focus on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model involves attempting to piece together past events to identify the reasons behind a specific result. We usually concentrate more on the elements closely connected to the outcome, which leads to hindsight bias.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a causal model involves piecing together past events to identify reasons behind results, which captures the essence of creating a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student explains that focusing on elements closely connected to the outcome leads to hindsight bias, which effectively captures how causal models make events seem more inevitable and contribute to hindsight bias.

Score: 1.0

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Learning entails incorporating new information to enhance our decision-making. Since it is unavoidable to take new information into account for future choices, the results we observe will inevitably influence how we evaluate the event afterward.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that learning involves acquiring new information and recognizes that this new information unavoidably influences retrospective evaluations of past events, which is the core mechanism of hindsight bias described in the answer key.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximising involves selecting the best possible option from all available choices, while satisficing means picking the first option that meets the necessary requirements. Individuals with high levels of neuroticism tend to be more inclined to maximise.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as selecting the best possible option from all available choices, which aligns with the answer key's definition of trying to make the best choice.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as picking the first option that meets necessary requirements, which corresponds to the answer key's definition of making a good-enough choice.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that individuals with high neuroticism tend to maximize, matching the answer key's statement that high neuroticism is associated with the maximizing decision style.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

I would approach this problem by creating a multi-attribute utility model. I would identify all relevant factors influencing the decision, such as how important student engagement in learning is or how comfortable students are with mandatory assignments, and assign appropriate weights to each factor, possibly consulting colleagues and former students. Using this, I could determine which choice appears to offer the greatest overall benefit.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The answer appears to misunderstand the question. The student describes creating a multi-attribute utility model to make a decision, but the question asks for practical teaching approaches to engage students within resource constraints. The response doesn't address teaching methods, assessment strategies, or student engagement techniques that would be relevant to the course context.
