## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

This theory suggests that system 1 plays the primary role in moral judgments because these decisions rely on intuitive, emotional responses. When confronted with a moral dilemma, system 1 responds immediately as an initial reaction. Although an individual may later engage system 2 to thoughtfully justify the judgment, this occurs only after the emotional response has taken place.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 involves intuitive, emotional responses in moral judgments.
- Correct: The student implicitly acknowledges System 2's role by mentioning that individuals 'engage system 2 to thoughtfully justify the judgment,' indicating understanding that System 2 involves reasoning/deliberation.
- Correct: The student clearly states that 'system 1 plays the primary role in moral judgments' and explains that System 2 reasoning occurs 'only after the emotional response has taken place,' demonstrating understanding that System 1 is dominant.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

The assumption is based on the representativeness heuristic, which leads us to classify a person or object—in this example, a classmate—as belonging to a particular group, such as models, because they share similar traits with other members of that group.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive bias in this scenario.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that the representativeness heuristic involves classifying someone as belonging to a group (models) based on shared traits with that group, which captures the essence of estimating likelihood based on resemblance to stereotypes.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

The primacy effect involves placing greater importance on the initial information we encounter when forming a judgment. It is connected to the anchoring effect, where the first piece of information serves as a reference point (anchor), and subsequent information is considered less significant but used to modify our judgment.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes anchoring as using first information as a reference point but doesn't clearly define it as the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point. The explanation is somewhat accurate but lacks the precise definition from the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student describes primacy effect as placing greater importance on initial information when forming judgments, but the answer key specifically defines it as the tendency to better remember the first piece of information. The student's answer focuses on judgment formation rather than memory retention.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both effects involve overreliance on first/initial information, stating that first information serves as reference point and subsequent information is considered less significant, which aligns with the answer key's point about overreliance on first information.

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion pertains to utility and involves placing greater importance on losses than on gains when deciding. Risk aversion involves probability and refers to steering clear of specific risks (such as dread risks) when making choices.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves placing greater importance on losses than on gains, which matches the key concept of weighing losses more heavily than gains.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly describes risk aversion as steering clear of specific risks like 'dread risks' rather than the general tendency to prefer certainty over uncertainty. This conflates risk aversion with other risk-related concepts.

Score: 0.5

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias is a cognitive tendency to overpredict how strongly and for how long an event will affect our future emotions. For example, someone considering ending a relationship might hesitate because they believe recovery will take a long time, overlooking the fact that they may feel relief from leaving a harmful situation, receive support from friends, and have the opportunity to meet someone new.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as overpredicting how strongly and for how long events will affect future emotions, which captures the essence of overestimating the impact of future events on feelings.
- Correct: The student provides a clear example showing how impact bias prevents breakups by explaining that people hesitate because they believe recovery will take longer than it actually will, which demonstrates understanding that people overestimate how bad a breakup will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting refers to our common mistake of inaccurately predicting how we will feel in the future about a certain event and how much impact it will have on us. When people are healthy, they often claim they would never want to be confined to a hospital bed and reliant on others' care, influenced by their current good health. However, affective forecasting is frequently incorrect because it is shaped by present emotions and feelings, which can change over time, and it overlooks other factors. As a result, making decisions about ending the lives of terminally ill individuals is challenging, since we cannot be sure that the preferences they expressed while healthy remain the same after their circumstances have changed.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines affective forecasting as predictions about future emotional states, though they frame it as 'inaccurately predicting how we will feel' which captures the essence of the concept.
- Correct: The student clearly explains that healthy people may express preferences about end-of-life situations that differ from what they would actually want when sick, directly addressing how this impacts end-of-life decision making.

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

This theory suggests that low probabilities tend to be overvalued, while extremely low probabilities are often regarded as impossible. As a result, our perception of probability is distorted and does not follow a linear pattern.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that low probabilities are overvalued/overestimated according to prospect theory.
- Correct: The student accurately states that extremely low probabilities are regarded as impossible, which aligns with the answer key's point about them being interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion involves a mistaken perception where losses are perceived as more significant than they actually are, causing them to be weighed more heavily than gains when making decisions or judgments.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly characterizes loss aversion as a 'mistaken perception' rather than understanding it as a systematic feature of how utilities are weighted in prospect theory. While they correctly identify that losses are weighed more heavily than gains, they miss that this is how the value function is structured (steeper for losses than gains) rather than being a perceptual error.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory allows financial calculations because it is primarily concerned with economic decisions. However, it can be extended to include non-financial choices by assigning them subjective utilities, while also considering personal perceptions of risk.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that expected value theory can be extended to include non-financial choices by assigning subjective utilities. This describes expected utility theory, not expected value theory. Expected value theory deals only with financial/monetary values.
- Incorrect: The student mentions 'considering personal perceptions of risk' but does not clearly distinguish that expected value theory ignores risk aversion while expected utility theory incorporates it. The answer lacks the clear contrast between the theories' treatment of heuristics, biases, and risk aversion.

Score: 0.0

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

The models include: expected value theory, a normative approach designed for financial decisions, where the potential financial outcomes of each choice are calculated based on their likelihood over repeated trials, relying on probability calculations. Expected utility theory is another normative model similar in structure to expected value theory but applicable beyond financial contexts. It involves determining the subjective utility of various options and combining these with their probabilities to identify the best outcome. Multi-attribute utility theory addresses decisions involving multiple factors by listing all attributes, assigning values to each, and weighting them in every option to find the optimal choice, making it normative as well. Prospect theory is descriptive, incorporating heuristics and biases like loss aversion and the distortion of probabilities, while maintaining a structure akin to expected utility theory.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as a normative model for financial decisions involving probability calculations of outcomes, which aligns with the answer key's description.
- Correct: The student accurately describes expected utility theory as similar to expected value theory but extending beyond financial contexts to include subjective utility, matching the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly explains multi-attribute utility theory as a normative model involving multiple attributes with utilities and weights, which corresponds to the answer key description.
- Correct: The student properly identifies prospect theory as a descriptive model that incorporates heuristics and biases while being similar to expected utility theory, consistent with the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

When events are presented in terms of potential losses, people tend to take more risks (for example, during economic crises, political messages focusing on what the country stands to lose lead individuals to support more extreme parties, as fear of loss outweighs the risk involved). Conversely, when events are framed around potential gains, individuals are less likely to take risks (when political discussions emphasize the benefits offered by a party without mentioning economic drawbacks, voters may opt for less extreme options).

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion makes people more willing to take risks when facing potential losses, demonstrating understanding that loss aversion can decrease risk aversion and make people risk-seeking. The political examples effectively illustrate this concept, showing how framing effects interact with loss aversion to influence risk preferences.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning is a learning process through which we develop associations by recognizing patterns of correlation. In classical conditioning, we connect two stimuli by identifying their correlation. In operant conditioning, we link a stimulus to a reward or punishment, depending on their relationship.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as a learning process involving associations and patterns of correlation, which aligns with the answer key's definition of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as connecting two stimuli through their correlation, which matches the answer key's explanation of learning to associate things that happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as linking a stimulus to rewards or punishments based on their relationship, which corresponds to the answer key's definition of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation occurs when we mistakenly think that two events that are merely correlated have a cause-and-effect connection. In contrast, an illusory correlation involves no actual correlation between the events; they simply occurred simultaneously by chance.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly distinguishes between illusory causation (mistakenly interpreting correlation as causation) and illusory correlation (perceiving correlation where none actually exists). The explanation accurately captures that illusory causation involves real correlation being misinterpreted as causal, while illusory correlation involves perceiving relationships that don't actually exist statistically.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

Understanding how the healthcare system operates is a schema because it represents specific knowledge about its functioning. In contrast, knowing how to act at a birthday party is a script, as it includes culturally and contextually specific elements that can differ across countries or groups, along with a set of expected behaviors for social acceptance. This differs from the healthcare system schema, which involves no behavioral guidelines, only information about its nature and use.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the healthcare system as a schema and provides a reasonable explanation that it represents specific knowledge about functioning, which aligns with the answer key's emphasis on knowledge and relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies birthday party behavior as a script and provides a good explanation emphasizing culturally specific behaviors and social expectations, which matches the answer key's description of a social schema for specific situational behavior.

Score: 1.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

Behaviorists take a mechanical approach, explaining behavior as a response to specific stimuli, much like a machine. Since they rejected the study of the mind, they also dismissed explanations based on mental functions (design stance) and the desires or motivations that can drive behavior (intentional stance).

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that behaviorists adopted the physical stance by describing their 'mechanical approach' that explains behavior as stimulus-response patterns 'much like a machine.' They also demonstrate understanding by correctly rejecting the design and intentional stances, showing they grasp why behaviorists focused on physical/mechanical processes rather than mental phenomena.

Score: 1.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

Evolutionary psychologists take the design stance, as they describe psychological mechanisms based on their role in aiding the survival of a species.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance and provides an appropriate explanation that they analyze psychological mechanisms based on their functional role in species survival, which aligns with the answer key's emphasis on considering processes in terms of their function.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Consider event A as eating candy and event B as experiencing a stomach ache: distinctiveness means event B occurs following event A, but not after other events; for example, when I eat candy, I get a stomach ache, but when I eat foods with less sugar, my stomach feels fine. Replicability refers to event B happening repeatedly after event A; nearly every time I consume excessive candy, I get a stomach ache. Plausibility indicates that it's reasonable to believe event A causes event B; many people I know also get stomach aches after eating a lot of candy, and scientific studies support this. Contiguity in time and space means event B occurs shortly after and near the time of event A; if I ate candy two days ago and have a stomach ache now, it's unlikely the candy caused it. Similarity of cause and effect shows that eating candy involves digestion in the stomach, where the pain arises, demonstrating a connection between the two events.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies distinctiveness (though calls it 'distinctiveness' rather than 'distinctness') and provides an accurate explanation with a relevant example showing B follows A but not other events.
- Correct: The student uses 'replicability' instead of 'consistency' but correctly explains the concept as B always/repeatedly following A with an appropriate example.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies plausibility and provides a good explanation involving common sense, social validation, and scientific support.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies contiguity in time and space, explaining temporal proximity with a clear counterexample of delayed effects being unlikely causal.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies similarity of cause and effect and provides a reasonable explanation connecting the digestive process (cause) with stomach location (effect).

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

The initial bias involved is the availability heuristic, where our frequent exposure to angry individuals on social media leads us to assume that people express their anger just as often and intensely in everyday life. This perception is reinforced by confirmation bias, as we either encounter outraged people in reality and interpret it as validation of our belief, or we browse social media and observe a multitude of angry individuals, which further strengthens our conviction.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student does not mention the negativity bias, which is one of the two primary biases in the answer key. Instead, they incorrectly identify confirmation bias as the second bias.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the availability heuristic and explains how frequent exposure to angry content on social media leads to overestimating the frequency of moral outrage in real life.
- Incorrect: The student does not explain the connection between negativity bias and availability heuristic as described in the answer key. Instead, they describe a different mechanism involving confirmation bias.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

Framework theories are our understanding of wide-ranging areas that help us address everyday issues or make sense of daily occurrences. An example of such a theory is germ theory, which states that microorganisms such as bacteria and viruses can spread to others or contaminate surfaces, and contact with these surfaces can cause illness. Extending this idea to believe that touching something owned by someone we dislike will similarly harm us is an exaggerated application of the biological germ theory into a magical context.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that biological contagion concepts (germ theory involving microorganisms) are being inappropriately applied to a social/magical domain where objects from disliked people are avoided, demonstrating understanding of cross-domain misapplication of framework theories.

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

In a delusional conspiracy theory, an individual is convinced with great certainty of an extremely improbable event. In contrast, someone endorsing a non-delusional conspiracy theory believes it for indirect motives, like aligning with specific political messages or seeking attention.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's answer focuses on certainty levels and motivations for belief, but misses the key distinction from the answer key that a delusional conspiracy theory requires both irrational belief AND lack of common acceptance. The student doesn't address the social acceptance criterion at all.

Score: 0.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

Three elements that encourage conspiratorial thinking include accepting straightforward explanations for complicated issues, having trust issues with authority figures (for example, supporting the free market and rejecting global warming due to opposition to government interventions), and believing in supernatural phenomena.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'accepting straightforward explanations for complicated issues' which matches the answer key point about 'believing in simple explanations for complex events'.
- Correct: The student mentions 'believing in supernatural phenomena' which directly corresponds to the answer key point about 'believing paranormal phenomena'.
- Incorrect: The student discusses 'trust issues with authority figures' and provides examples about free market support and climate change skepticism, but this does not match any of the specific cognitive and personality factors listed in the answer key.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

These wrong answers function as beliefs formed before encountering the accurate information and can affect our understanding, even when we attempt to ignore them, since our final decision still considers them. This implies that even when we are aware that prior knowledge is false and try to amend it, it is difficult to completely disregard it, which can lead to confusion later and cause us to mistakenly accept it as true. Additionally, the tendency to forget the origins of our knowledge contributes to this effect.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the key mechanism of source amnesia in the final sentence, mentioning 'the tendency to forget the origins of our knowledge.' They also accurately describe how incorrect initial answers can interfere with learning by becoming persistent beliefs that are difficult to disregard, even when we know they're wrong, which aligns with the continued-influence effect mentioned in the answer key.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

We tend to favor things we know well, so we are more likely to believe a statement we've encountered before than one that is entirely new to us. This phenomenon is known as the mere exposure effect.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the mere exposure effect as the psychological mechanism by which repeated statements become more attractive. They accurately describe how familiarity leads to preference and increased belief in repeated statements.

Score: 1.0

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Healthy individuals frequently make faulty predictions due to the positivity bias, which leads them to overestimate the likelihood of positive events occurring. Those experiencing depression lack this bias but can still make inaccurate forecasts because of the negativity bias, which causes a preference for negative information over positive. Additionally, predictions about the future are significantly influenced by one's present emotional state, so people with depression may tend to overpredict the amount of negative occurrences in their lives.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that people with depression are less accurate due to negativity bias and overpredicting negative events. The answer key indicates that people with major depressive disorder are MORE accurate at making predictions about bad events because they have reduced optimism bias, not that they are less accurate due to negativity bias.

Score: 0.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

When sensory information is unreliable, our existing beliefs have a stronger impact on our final perception, causing that perception to more closely align with those prior beliefs than with the actual evidence.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when sensory information is unreliable, prior beliefs have a stronger impact on perception, and that perception aligns more with expectations than with actual sensory evidence. This directly matches the answer key's requirement that perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs when sensory reliability decreases.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

Kohlberg proposed that moral development occurs in three stages: the preconventional level, where a person behaves to avoid punishment or gain rewards; the conventional level, where actions are guided by empathy for others or the desire to follow laws and uphold social order; and the postconventional level, where an individual adheres to universal principles of justice that may differ from government laws, focusing on equality for all.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the preconventional level and accurately describes it as behavior focused on avoiding punishment or gaining rewards.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the conventional level and provides an accurate description focusing on empathy for others and following laws/social order, which aligns with the focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the postconventional level and accurately describes it as adherence to universal principles of justice and equality, which demonstrates focus on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model is a narrative we construct to account for an event by identifying its cause. When we build such a model for an event with an unknown cause—often based on guesswork—and then discover the actual cause later, we naturally incorporate this new information into the model. This process fuels the "I knew it all along" sensation and the sense of inevitability that defines hindsight bias.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies a causal model as a narrative that accounts for events by identifying causes, which aligns with the answer key's description of it being a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student effectively explains how causal models contribute to hindsight bias by describing how incorporating new information creates a sense of inevitability and the 'I knew it all along' sensation, which matches the answer key's point about events seeming more inevitable than they were.

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Once we understand the cause of an event, we naturally incorporate that explanation into our existing causal framework for the event. Even if we try to resist, it is difficult for our minds to ignore this knowledge, so it keeps affecting how we view what occurred. As a result, hindsight bias occurs because we assume that the cause was always part of our understanding.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly explains that newly learned information (understanding the cause) cannot be avoided when estimating past judgments, and that this knowledge inevitably affects how we view what occurred, which aligns with the key concept that we cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account when estimating past likelihood judgments.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

In the maximizing approach, an individual aims to choose the best possible option, reflecting a type of perfectionism. In contrast, the satisficing approach involves selecting an option that is good enough to meet current needs, without striving for the absolute best. People who score high in neuroticism tend to adopt the maximizing style, meaning they are more likely to seek the optimal solution when making decisions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as aiming to choose the best possible option, which aligns with the answer key's definition of 'trying to make the best choice.'
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as selecting an option that is 'good enough to meet current needs,' which matches the answer key's definition of 'making a good-enough choice.'
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people high in neuroticism tend to adopt the maximizing style, which directly matches the answer key's requirement.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

From my experience, I grasp the course material best when writing essays or reports that require connecting the subject matter to a specific topic. Consequently, I would use open-ended questions that don’t have definitive answers but encourage students to link ideas and think creatively. To reduce the time needed for grading, I might have other students evaluate the work and submit a report expanding on the topic, with the final grade determined by an oral presentation.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement by proposing a concrete pedagogical approach that addresses the core challenge. They suggest using open-ended questions to promote active engagement, incorporate peer evaluation to reduce grading time, and include oral presentations for assessment. The answer shows thoughtful consideration of both student engagement and resource constraints mentioned in the question.
