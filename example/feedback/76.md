## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidtâ€™s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

In moral reasoning, System 1 thinking plays a primary role in the initial stages, characterized by quick, automatic, emotion-based responses that often operate below conscious awareness and depend heavily on mental shortcuts. In contrast, the more advanced stages of moral reasoning involve System 2 thinking, which is slower, more intentional, mentally demanding, fully conscious, and guided by logical analysis. This framework suggests that System 1 thinking tends to be the prevailing influence.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies System 1 thinking as emotion-based and automatic, which aligns with the answer key's requirement that System 1 refers to intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student accurately describes System 2 thinking as slower, intentional, and guided by logical analysis, which corresponds to the answer key's definition of System 2 as reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student states that 'System 1 thinking tends to be the prevailing influence,' which correctly indicates that System 1 is more dominant than System 2, satisfying the third point in the answer key.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

The representativeness heuristic explains this assumption by suggesting that we tend to evaluate something and its category membership based on how similar it is to our mental image of a typical member of that category.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive mechanism for this assumption.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that the representativeness heuristic involves evaluating category membership based on similarity to a typical or stereotypical member of that category, which matches the key concept in the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring occurs when the first piece of information we receive heavily affects how we interpret subsequent values. Similarly, the primacy effect in forming impressions of others means that the initial details we learn about someone significantly shape our overall judgment of them. Both phenomena highlight the powerful impact of the initial information we encounter.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as being heavily influenced by the first piece of information received, which aligns with the answer key's definition of taking the first piece of information as the starting point.
- Incorrect: The student describes the primacy effect in the context of forming impressions of others rather than memory. The answer key specifically refers to the tendency to better remember the first piece of information, which is different from impression formation.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both phenomena involve the powerful impact of initial information, which matches the answer key's point about overreliance on the first piece of information.

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion is a mental shortcut, whereas risk aversion involves more conscious decision-making.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes loss aversion as a 'mental shortcut' but fails to explain what loss aversion actually is - that people weigh losses more heavily than equivalent gains.
- Incorrect: The student describes risk aversion in terms of conscious vs unconscious processing rather than explaining it as the preference for certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 0.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias occurs when individuals exaggerate how much a choice will affect their feelings. This might lead people in an unhappy relationship to stay together, as they may think that ending the relationship will harm them more emotionally than remaining in it.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies impact bias as exaggerating how much a choice will affect feelings, which aligns with overestimating the impact of future events on future feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly explains that impact bias prevents breakups because people think ending the relationship will cause more emotional harm than it actually would, which matches overestimating how bad a breakup will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting refers to our ability to anticipate how future events will influence our emotions. This concept is significant in end-of-life decision-making because individuals tend to overpredict the emotional impact of these events, which is relevant when they are determining their preferences for what they want to occur at the end of their lives.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines affective forecasting as anticipating how future events will influence our emotions, which aligns with the answer key's definition of predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Incorrect: While the student mentions overpredicting emotional impact, they don't capture the specific dynamic described in the answer key - that healthy people may predict preferring death when sick, but actually sick people may not prefer to die.

Score: 0.5

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

People tend to overvalue small chances, and this tendency is consistent whether the probabilities are low or very low.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people overvalue/overestimate low probabilities, which aligns with the answer key's point about merely low probabilities being overestimated.
- Incorrect: The student states the tendency is consistent across all low probabilities, but the answer key specifies that extremely low probabilities are treated differently - they are interpreted as impossibilities rather than overestimated.

Score: 0.5

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion represents a negative value in prospect theory, as the cognitive effort required to make decisions that avoid losses is perceived as unpleasant.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly describes loss aversion as representing 'a negative value' and focuses on cognitive effort and unpleasantness of decision-making. The correct answer is that loss aversion means negative utilities (losses) are weighed more heavily than positive utilities (gains), or that the value function is steeper for losses than gains. The student's answer does not capture this key asymmetry in weighting.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

A key distinction is that expected value theory usually deals with monetary values, whereas expected utility theory encompasses subjective, non-monetary values. Additionally, expected utility theory can handle both negative and positive utilities, while expected value theory generally focuses on positive values.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory deals with monetary values while expected utility theory encompasses subjective, non-monetary values, which matches the first point in the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student discusses positive vs negative utilities rather than addressing risk aversion and heuristics/biases, which is the key distinction outlined in the second point of the answer key.

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesnâ€™t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected value theory suggests that individuals select the option with the highest expected value over time. Expected utility theory proposes that people pick the option that offers the highest personal value or utility. Prospect theory describes how individuals make choices by aiming for the greatest utility while also accounting for possible heuristics and biases. Cost-benefit analysis entails evaluating the costs and benefits of each alternative and choosing the one that reduces costs and increases benefits the most.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as selecting options with highest expected value, though lacks detail about probability and financial outcomes.
- Correct: The student correctly describes expected utility theory as choosing options with highest personal utility, capturing the key difference from expected value theory.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention multi-attribute utility theory at all, instead discussing cost-benefit analysis which is not one of the four models from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies prospect theory as a descriptive model that accounts for heuristics and biases in utility maximization, though could be more specific about it being behavioral.

Score: 0.75

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease peopleâ€™s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Loss aversion influences how risk-averse individuals are, as it depends on how options are presented. When choices are framed around potential losses, loss aversion arises, meaning people tend to avoid risks more strongly than they seek gains. The level of risk aversion varies based on how the risks associated with the options are perceived.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that loss aversion makes people avoid risks more strongly, when the answer key indicates that loss aversion actually decreases risk aversion and can make people risk-seeking when trying to avoid potential losses.

Score: 0.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning is the process by which individuals learn connections through the occurrence of events together. Classical conditioning involves learning to link two stimuli that frequently occur close together in time and place, while operant conditioning involves learning to connect one's behavior with outcomes such as rewards or punishments.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as learning connections/associations through events occurring together, which matches the answer key's definition of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as learning to link two stimuli that occur close together in time and place, which aligns with the answer key's explanation of associating things that happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning to connect behavior with outcomes like rewards or punishments, which matches the answer key's description of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation refers to the mistaken belief that one thing causes another despite lacking strong evidence to support this connection. Illusory correlation involves perceiving a relationship between two events based on personal bias, even though there is insufficient evidence to confirm such a link.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's answer misses the key distinction. While they correctly identify that illusory causation involves mistaken causal beliefs, they fail to specify that it occurs when correlation is incorrectly interpreted as causation. For illusory correlation, they describe it as perceiving relationships based on bias with insufficient evidence, but don't capture that it's specifically about perceiving correlations that don't actually exist between variables.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to â€˜properlyâ€™ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

Comprehending the Dutch healthcare system is an example of a schema, whereas knowing the correct behavior at a birthday party is an example of a script. This distinction exists because schemas encompass general knowledge about how things function in the world, while scripts involve detailed, routine expectations for specific situations.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the Dutch healthcare system as a schema and provides an accurate explanation that schemas encompass general knowledge about how things function, which aligns with the answer key's description of knowledge and relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies birthday party behavior as a script and provides a good explanation that scripts involve detailed, routine expectations for specific situations, which matches the answer key's description of social schemas describing appropriate behavior in specific contexts.

Score: 1.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

Behaviorists used the mechanical perspective to describe how stimuli cause behavior, as this approach explains it through physical properties.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that behaviorists adopted the physical stance (referred to as 'mechanical perspective'), and accurately explains that this was because they focused on how stimuli cause behavior through physical properties, which aligns with the answer key's emphasis on physical processes causing stimulus-behavior relationships.

Score: 1.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

Evolutionary psychologists use the intentional stance because it interprets behavior based on the thoughts and intentions that drive it.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the intentional stance instead of the design stance. Evolutionary psychology focuses on the function and adaptive purpose of psychological processes (design stance), not on interpreting behavior through thoughts and intentions (intentional stance).

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Likelihood of cause, where A probably causes B and B comes after A. Resemblance between cause and effect, where A looks like B and B looks like A. Closeness in time and location, where B is generally near A and A is generally near B. Regularity, where A typically happens before B and B typically occurs after A. Mutual reliance, where A relies on B and B relies on A.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions 'likelihood of cause' but doesn't capture the distinctness/specificity heuristic, which requires that B follows A but not other events.
- Incorrect: The student describes 'regularity' as A typically happening before B, but misses the consistency heuristic which requires that B ALWAYS follows A, not just typically.
- Incorrect: The student doesn't mention plausibility at all - the heuristic that common sense must make it reasonable that A causes B.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'closeness in time and location' which matches the contiguity in time and space heuristic.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'resemblance between cause and effect' where A looks like B, matching the similarity in cause and effect heuristic.

Score: 0.4

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Confirmation bias occurs when individuals focus solely on information that supports their existing beliefs and avoid challenging it. Negativity bias is the inclination to attract oneself to negative, emotionally charged content. These biases combine to create an overestimation because social media activity is frequently tailored to reinforce confirmation bias, while the increased availability of negative emotional content makes it easier for people to engage with it.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions negativity bias correctly as the inclination to attract oneself to negative content, but incorrectly identifies confirmation bias as the first bias instead of the availability heuristic.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias as the tendency to be drawn to negative, emotionally charged content, which aligns with the answer key's definition.
- Incorrect: The student attempts to explain how the biases combine but focuses on confirmation bias and social media algorithms rather than explaining how negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage which through availability heuristic leads to overestimation.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

Regarding one of the various knowledge domains that make up our framework theories, we tend to avoid using items that once belonged to someone we strongly dislike because we associate those objects negatively with that individual. This understanding comes from the field of psychology.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly identifies psychology as a relevant domain but fails to explain the key concept that biological contagion principles are being misapplied to social/psychological situations. The answer describes the phenomenon but doesn't address how framework theories from different domains (specifically biological contagion) are incorrectly transferred to explain social behavior.

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A delusional conspiracy theory relies entirely on personal beliefs without any supporting proof, while a non-delusional conspiracy theory is grounded in shared beliefs among a group that are backed by evidence.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student focuses on evidence and proof rather than the key distinction in the answer key. The answer key defines delusional conspiracy theories as those that are both irrational beliefs AND not commonly accepted, while the student incorrectly suggests that non-delusional theories must be 'backed by evidence' and misses the critical criterion of common acceptance versus individual belief.

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

Three elements that foster conspiratorial thinking are elevated neuroticism, distrust toward others, and a tendency to be easily influenced in believing specific ideas.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: Elevated neuroticism is not mentioned in the answer key as one of the cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking.
- Incorrect: Distrust toward others is not listed in the answer key as one of the specific factors discussed in the lecture.
- Incorrect: Tendency to be easily influenced is not mentioned in the answer key, which focuses on specific cognitive biases and personality traits like pattern recognition, paranormal beliefs, and narcissism.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you donâ€™t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Providing wrong answers initially can disrupt learning by triggering priming effects. Although incorrect responses might hinder our ability to grasp the right information at first, repeated exposure over time makes it easier to remember and retain the correct knowledge.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions priming effects as the mechanism, but this is not correct. The answer key specifically identifies source amnesia (forgetting that an incorrect answer was wrong and mistaking it for correct), proactive interference (initial incorrect answers interfering with later correct ones), or the continued-influence effect. Priming effects do not explain how incorrect answers interfere with learning the correct information.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

Politicians aim to make their message more appealing by repeatedly conveying it, relying on the continued influence effect.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the 'continued influence effect' as the mechanism. The correct answer is 'mere exposure effect' (or illusory-truth effect), which refers to the tendency to prefer familiar things through repeated exposure. The continued influence effect relates to how misinformation persists even after correction, which is not the psychological mechanism being asked about.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Certainly.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student provided no substantive answer to the question about whether major depressive disorder affects accuracy in predicting negative events. The response 'Certainly' does not address the key point that people with major depressive disorder are more accurate due to reduced optimism bias.

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

The impact of existing beliefs on perception becomes stronger as the trustworthiness of sensory data diminishes.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that prior beliefs have stronger influence on perception when sensory information is less reliable. The answer captures the core concept using appropriate terminology ('existing beliefs' for prior beliefs, 'trustworthiness of sensory data' for reliability of sensory information).

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You donâ€™t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other peopleâ€™s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

Preconventional moral development involves forming morals based on instructions or rules given by others. Conventional moral development involves shaping morals according to the beliefs and expectations of those around you. Postconventional moral development involves reaching a level of maturity that allows you to establish your own morals through independent and advanced reasoning.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes preconventional level as being based on external rules and instructions, which aligns with the focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes conventional level as being shaped by beliefs and expectations of others, which matches the focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly describes postconventional level as involving independent reasoning to establish one's own morals, which corresponds to the focus on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model helps us identify and comprehend the reasons behind a particular result or event. Hindsight bias occurs when we judge an outcome as something we ought to have predicted, even though we had no prior knowledge of it. In this context, the causal model influences how we interpret the cause of the outcome, leading us to conclude that the cause was a failure to recognize it earlier when we should have.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a causal model helps us understand the reasons behind events, which aligns with the answer key's definition of a coherent narrative explaining how past events are related.
- Incorrect: While the student describes hindsight bias accurately, they don't clearly explain how causal models contribute to it. The answer key requires explaining that events in causal models seem more inevitable than they were, but the student focuses on self-blame rather than the inevitability aspect.

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

After acquiring new information like the result of a decision, individuals cannot prevent it from affecting their subsequent probability assessments.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that newly acquired information cannot be prevented from influencing retrospective probability judgments, which captures the core mechanism of hindsight bias as described in the answer key.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

The maximizing decision style involves consistently aiming to select the best possible option or achieve the ideal outcome. In contrast, the satisficing decision style involves choosing an option that is sufficiently good given the specific situation. Individuals with high levels of neuroticism are more prone to use the maximizing decision style.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as aiming to select the best possible option or achieve the ideal outcome, which aligns with 'trying to make the best choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as choosing an option that is sufficiently good given the situation, which matches 'making a good-enough choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that individuals with high neuroticism are more prone to use the maximizing decision style, which directly matches the answer key.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

To address the question of how to evaluate the students, I would assign a comprehensive project designed to accurately measure their involvement with the content. Students would select a chapter they feel most confident about and form small groups with others who share that preference. These groups would then be matched with others based on a survey indicating which chapters they feel least confident about. Each group would prepare a presentation featuring clear examples aimed at boosting their own confidence and enhancing the other group's comprehension.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement by proposing a detailed, practical solution that addresses the core challenge. The group-based presentation approach leverages peer learning, allows for efficient resource use by having students teach each other, and creates active engagement through both preparation and learning from others. The matching system based on confidence levels shows thoughtful consideration of how to maximize learning outcomes while minimizing instructor workload.
