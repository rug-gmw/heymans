## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidtâ€™s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

Moral reasoning is frequently driven by moral intuition, which relies on biases and mental shortcuts associated with system 1. Deeper reflection may involve system 2, but often the true basis for a moral judgment is difficult to articulate and justify because it stems from moral intuition, making system 1 the more influential factor.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 is associated with moral intuition, which aligns with the answer key's requirement that System 1 refers to intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student mentions 'deeper reflection' involving System 2, which corresponds to the answer key's requirement that System 2 refers to reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student clearly states that System 1 is 'the more influential factor' and explains that moral judgments stem from moral intuition, demonstrating that System 1 is more dominant than System 2.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

This is an example of the representative heuristic, where we judge someone as a fashion model simply because they possess characteristics we associate with that role, ignoring the actual likelihood of them being a model (base rate neglect). This overlooks the improbability of someone simultaneously being both a student and a model.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process in this scenario.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of the representativeness heuristic by explaining that we judge category membership based on resemblance to associated characteristics/stereotypes, and even mentions the related concept of base rate neglect.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring refers to the initial information presented that serves as a reference point for a number or task, whereas the primacy effect describes how the first information received is more likely to be remembered. Both significantly influence impressions and memory.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as initial information serving as a reference point, which aligns with the answer key's definition of taking the first piece of information as the starting point.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as the first information being more likely to be remembered, which matches the answer key's definition of better remembering the first piece of information.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both concepts significantly influence impressions and memory, which demonstrates understanding of their common overreliance on first information, though expressed less precisely than the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

The distinction is that loss aversion focuses on avoiding losses of what you currently possess, whereas risk aversion emphasizes reducing uncertainty by opting for a guaranteed outcome.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion focuses on avoiding losses of what you currently possess, which captures the essence of weighing losses more heavily than gains.
- Correct: The student accurately describes risk aversion as emphasizing reducing uncertainty by opting for guaranteed outcomes, which aligns with the preference for certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 1.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias occurs when we exaggerate how negatively we will feel, such as after a breakup, and consequently overestimate its effect on us. This happens because we concentrate too much on that single event (focalism) and generally overpredict the intensity and duration of our emotions (emotional evanescence). As a result, people may remain in unhappy relationships, believing that life outside the relationship will be worse and that their emotional pain will last longer.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies impact bias as overestimating the impact of future events on feelings, though they focus specifically on negative feelings rather than the general tendency.
- Correct: The student clearly explains how impact bias prevents breakups by showing people overestimate how bad they'll feel after breaking up, leading them to stay in unhappy relationships.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting refers to our ability to anticipate our future emotional states, which is often influenced by impact bias, focalism, and the transient nature of emotions. This concept plays a crucial role in end-of-life decision-making because when we are young, we may believe that we would choose to die in difficult circumstances. However, we tend to exaggerate the intensity of these feelings and overlook other factors that could affect us differently and encourage us to keep living.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines affective forecasting as our ability to anticipate future emotional states, which matches the answer key's definition of predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Correct: The student accurately captures the key concept that healthy/young people may predict they would choose to die in difficult circumstances, but may actually feel differently when facing those situations, which aligns with the answer key's point about preferences changing when actually sick.

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

It varies; probabilities around 10% are often overestimated, while very low probabilities are usually underestimated or considered impossible.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that probabilities around 10% are often overestimated, which aligns with the answer key's point about merely low probabilities being overestimated.
- Correct: The student correctly states that very low probabilities are 'considered impossible,' which matches the answer key's point about extremely low probabilities being interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion reflects negative utility and causes a steep drop in the prospect theory curve, resulting in a divergence of the utility and prospect theory lines in the bottom left corner due to the bias introduced by loss aversion.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves negative utility and a steep drop in the prospect theory curve, which captures the key concept that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains, even though the explanation is somewhat convoluted.

Score: 1.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory considers only monetary outcomes, whereas expected utility theory goes further by incorporating additional factors and personal preferences to assign different weights.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory deals only with monetary outcomes while expected utility theory incorporates additional factors beyond financial values, which aligns with the answer key's first point.
- Incorrect: While the student mentions that expected utility theory incorporates personal preferences and weights, they do not specifically address risk aversion or the concept that expected value theory ignores heuristics and biases, which is the key distinction in the second point.

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesnâ€™t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected value theory is a normative approach focused on monetary utility combined with weights. Expected utility theory builds on this by addressing more than just monetary factors. Multiattribute utility theory is normative regarding multiple attributes and their respective weights. Prospect theory further expands on these ideas by incorporating biases and heuristics, making it descriptive.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly describes expected value theory as involving 'weights' when it actually involves probabilities of financial outcomes. The core concept of probability is missing.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected utility theory builds on expected value theory by addressing non-monetary factors (subjective utility), capturing the key distinction.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies multi-attribute utility theory as normative and involving multiple attributes with weights, which matches the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies prospect theory as descriptive and incorporating biases and heuristics, which aligns with the answer key's description.

Score: 0.75

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease peopleâ€™s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

When avoiding loss requires taking risks, people generally become less averse to risk.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion can reduce risk aversion when avoiding losses requires taking risks, which captures the key concept that people become more willing to accept risk to avoid potential losses.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves learning associations. Classical conditioning is acquiring knowledge about events occurring simultaneously in a specific context, while operant conditioning involves learning through consequences such as rewards and punishments.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as learning associations, which aligns with the answer key's definition of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as learning about events occurring simultaneously in context, which captures the essence of learning associations when things happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning through consequences like rewards and punishments, which matches the answer key's description of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusionary causation suggests that something occurred due to a specific cause, whereas illusionary correlation assumes that events frequently happening together are connected, even though they may not share a direct cause-and-effect relationship within the same timeframe.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student confuses the concepts. They describe illusory causation as suggesting something occurred due to a specific cause (which is vague), and illusory correlation as events happening together without direct cause-and-effect. However, the correct distinction is that illusory causation is misinterpreting an actual correlation as causation, while illusory correlation is perceiving a correlation that doesn't actually exist between variables.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to â€˜properlyâ€™ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

The healthcare system functions as a schema, representing a general framework of tasks and operations, since these are the activities carried out within the system. There are specific rules and processes that must be understood. Proper behavior follows a script, guiding how to act in typical and culturally specific scenarios, which itself is based on schemas. For example, behavior during a birthday celebration varies according to different cultural traditions, making it culturally specific.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the healthcare system as a schema and provides a reasonable explanation that it represents a framework of knowledge about tasks, operations, rules and processes that must be understood.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies proper behavior at a birthday party as a script and explains that it guides how to act in typical, culturally specific scenarios, demonstrating understanding that scripts are situation-specific behavioral sequences.

Score: 1.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

From a physical perspective, they saw the person solely based on their physical abilities, without considering their intentions or motives.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly identifies the physical stance but provides an incomplete and somewhat inaccurate explanation. The answer focuses on ignoring intentions/motives but misses the key point that behaviorists adopted the physical stance because they focused on the causal processes linking stimuli to behavioral responses.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

The intentional stance involves explaining behavior by the intentions behind it (because it is advantageous), considering not just tangible objects or concepts but also the reasons and benefits driving that choice.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the intentional stance instead of the design stance. While they correctly recognize that evolutionary psychology focuses on advantages and benefits, the intentional stance explains behavior through beliefs and desires, whereas the design stance explains phenomena through their function or purpose, which is what evolutionary psychologists actually adopt.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Distinct and specific, only after b does a occur, with no other connections involved. It is reasonable to conclude that a follows b, as it appears logical. This relationship is persistent, consistently occurring every time; a always follows b. It is consistent across both space and time, meaning a happens after b in a timely and spatially linked way. Thus, it is logical to see a following b.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions 'distinct and specific' but incorrectly states 'only after b does a occur' and 'a follows b', which reverses the causal direction. The answer key requires that B follows A, not A follows B.
- Incorrect: The student mentions consistency but again reverses the causal relationship, stating 'a always follows b' instead of 'B always follows A' as required by the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies plausibility, stating 'it is reasonable to conclude' and 'appears logical', which aligns with the answer key's requirement for common sense plausibility.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies contiguity in time and space, mentioning 'consistent across both space and time' and 'timely and spatially linked way', which matches the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention similarity in cause and effect at all. This heuristic is completely missing from their response.

Score: 0.4

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

The negativity bias and availability heuristic cause us to notice negative information more frequently because it appears often and is readily accessible. As a result, we believe that many people are constantly upset about everything, even though this is not true.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias as one of the two primary biases and shows understanding that it involves noticing negative information more frequently.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies availability heuristic as the second bias and demonstrates understanding that it relates to information being readily accessible affecting our judgments.
- Correct: The student successfully explains the connection between the two biases - that negativity bias makes negative content more noticeable, which through availability heuristic leads to overestimating how many people are morally outraged.

Score: 1.0

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

Through learning, negative emotions continue to exist and become linked to specific objects, causing the emotions to be transferable.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes emotional transfer but fails to identify the key concept of framework theories - specifically that biological contagion concepts are being misapplied to the social/psychological domain. The answer doesn't mention domains of knowledge or framework theories at all.

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A delusionary conspiracy theory relies on ideas and assumptions that are not widely accepted, with the main distinction being the level of public acceptance. Non-delusional conspiracy theories appear believable and plausible, gaining broader acceptance, although they are still considered conspiracy theories.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student only identifies one criterion (public acceptance) but misses the equally important criterion of irrationality. The answer key requires both conditions: a conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both irrational AND not commonly accepted. The student's answer focuses solely on public acceptance without addressing the rationality aspect.

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

possessing limited intelligence, belonging to a minority group, which results in ingroup favoritism (us versus them), and having limited education

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'possessing limited intelligence' which matches the answer key point about 'having a low level of intelligence'.
- Incorrect: While the student mentions 'belonging to a minority group' and 'ingroup favoritism', this does not match any of the specific factors listed in the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student mentions 'having limited education' but this is not among the cognitive and personality factors listed in the answer key, which focuses on intelligence and analytical thinking rather than education level.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you donâ€™t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

This is an example of the availability heuristic and context amnesia, where an incorrect answer may surface because it remains accessible, but the context in which it was originally recalled is lost, resulting in mistakenly remembering the false answer as true.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions 'context amnesia' which is close to source amnesia, but availability heuristic is not the correct mechanism. The student doesn't clearly identify source amnesia as the key concept, nor do they mention proactive interference or continued-influence effect as alternative explanations.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

The mere exposure effect and availability heuristic suggest that because we frequently encounter it, it becomes more accessible in our minds, which increases its appeal.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the mere exposure effect as the psychological mechanism through which repeated statements become more attractive due to familiarity, which directly matches the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

No, it actually improves them.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that major depressive disorder does not make people less accurate at predictions, and that it actually improves accuracy, which aligns with the answer key's point about increased accuracy due to reduced optimism bias.

Score: 1.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

The impact of previous knowledge increases because the new information is not as effectively processed, limiting its influence on new perceptions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that prior knowledge (previous beliefs) increases in influence when sensory information is less reliable. The answer demonstrates understanding that unreliable sensory input limits the contribution of new information to perception, thereby increasing reliance on expectations/priors.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You donâ€™t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other peopleâ€™s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

The first level, pre-conventional, focuses on right and wrong determined by punishment and reward and is primarily self-focused. The second level, conventional, involves following rules and behaviors influenced by what you believe others expect from you, aiming to meet those expectations. The third level, post-conventional, recognizes that rules, morals, and personal ideas of fairness may vary and do not always align.

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies pre-conventional level as focusing on punishment and reward, which matches the answer key's description of obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: Student accurately describes conventional level as following rules based on others' expectations, which aligns with the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: Student demonstrates understanding of post-conventional level by describing recognition that rules and morals may vary and don't always align, which reflects the answer key's focus on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

When we reflect on events, we tend to try to find meaning, which creates a sense of creeping determinismâ€”making it appear as though everything had to happen a certain way, with each event causing the next, ultimately increasing hindsight bias.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a causal model involves finding meaning and connecting events in a cause-and-effect sequence, which aligns with the concept of a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student accurately describes how causal models contribute to hindsight bias through 'creeping determinism,' making events appear inevitable ('had to happen a certain way'), which directly matches the answer key's point about events seeming more inevitable than they were.

Score: 1.0

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Once the events are known, it becomes difficult to view them without considering this knowledge, which increases the tendency for hindsight bias.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that knowledge of events makes it difficult to ignore that information when making retrospective judgments, which is the core mechanism of how learning contributes to hindsight bias. This captures the essence of being unable to avoid taking newly learned information into account when estimating past likelihood judgments.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing involves aiming for the best possible result and making the optimal decision, similar to a perfectionist, and is linked to higher levels of neuroticism, suggesting that the individual is more likely to use a maximizing approach. In contrast, satisficing focuses on selecting an option that is adequate or satisfactory.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as 'aiming for the best possible result and making the optimal decision', which aligns with the answer key's definition of 'trying to make the best choice'.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as 'selecting an option that is adequate or satisfactory', which matches the answer key's definition of 'making a good-enough choice'.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that maximizing 'is linked to higher levels of neuroticism', directly answering that individuals high in neuroticism are more likely to use a maximizing approach.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

It might be beneficial to use a bit of subtle deception here. Assign a task that requires students to engage with the course material and assign each person a peer to review. Set a deadline for a draft that is commented on by fellow students, followed by a deadline for a version that will be graded by peers. Have several students randomly and anonymously evaluate each other's work. While students may generally be lenient, they will still be honest about truly poor assignments. This way, you only need to personally grade the work that fails or just meets the minimum standards, as students tend to be generous. To ensure fairness, consider having around five students review each assignment to balance out overly lenient or harsh evaluations.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement with the question by proposing a detailed peer review system that addresses the core challenge of limited time and resources while promoting student engagement. The answer shows thoughtful consideration of practical implementation details (multiple reviewers, anonymous evaluation, instructor oversight of failing work) and acknowledges potential issues with student grading tendencies. The solution is creative, feasible, and directly responds to the constraints mentioned in the question.
