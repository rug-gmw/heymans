## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidtâ€™s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

This model suggests that both systems outline approaches to moral decision-making. System 1, also known as the intuitionist model, depends on quick, automatic, and emotion-driven thinking for moral judgments. System 2, or the rationalist model, involves slower, more deliberate thought processes to reach moral conclusions. Here, System 1 takes the lead because moral judgments stem from intuition, which itself arises from emotions and feelings.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies System 1 as involving 'quick, automatic, and emotion-driven thinking' which aligns with the answer key's description of intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student correctly describes System 2 as involving 'slower, more deliberate thought processes' which matches the answer key's description of reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student explicitly states 'System 1 takes the lead' and explains that moral judgments stem from intuition and emotions, correctly identifying System 1 as more dominant.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

This illustrates the representativeness heuristic, which describes how we often assume that something or someone fits into a particular group simply because they appear to match the typical characteristics of that group.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive mechanism in this scenario.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that the representativeness heuristic involves making assumptions about category membership based on how well someone matches typical characteristics of that group, which aligns with the answer key's explanation about estimating likelihood based on resemblance to stereotypes.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring involves introducing an initial piece of information, like a price, which then serves as a benchmark for evaluating subsequent details. The primacy effect describes how we tend to recall the first piece of information or impression we receive. Both concepts highlight the significance of the first piece of information, as it is most vividly remembered and influences our judgments and perceptions of things, people, or prices.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as using the first piece of information as a starting point/benchmark for evaluating subsequent information, which matches the answer key's definition.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as the tendency to recall the first piece of information or impression, which aligns with the answer key's description of better remembering first information.
- Correct: The student clearly identifies that both concepts share the commonality of highlighting the significance of first information and its influence on judgments, which corresponds to the answer key's point about overreliance on first information.

Score: 1.0

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to our inclination to prevent losing what we have, while risk aversion describes our preference to steer clear of excessive risks to avoid significant losses.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes loss aversion as preventing losing what we have, but misses the key concept that losses are weighted more heavily than equivalent gains. The definition lacks the comparative aspect between losses and gains.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly defines risk aversion as avoiding excessive risks to prevent significant losses, conflating it with loss aversion. Risk aversion is about preferring certainty over uncertainty, not specifically about avoiding losses.

Score: 0.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias refers to our habit of exaggerating how negatively we'll feel following an event. For instance, individuals in unhappy relationships often stay together because they assume the breakup will devastate them more than it actually does. However, people typically don't feel as distressed afterward as they initially expected.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies impact bias as the tendency to exaggerate how negatively we'll feel following an event, which captures the essence of overestimating the impact of future events on our feelings.
- Correct: The student accurately explains how impact bias prevents breakups by describing that people in unhappy relationships stay together because they assume the breakup will devastate them more than it actually does, which aligns with overestimating how bad a breakup will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves predicting our future emotions based on possible upcoming events. Often, we exaggerate the negative emotional impact these events will have on us. This is particularly relevant in end-of-life decisions, as terminally ill individuals may opt for an early death because they overestimate the emotional suffering they expect to experience as their condition worsens.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies affective forecasting as predicting future emotions, which aligns with the answer key's definition of 'predictions about our own future emotional state.'
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of the core concept by explaining that terminally ill individuals may choose early death due to overestimating future suffering, which captures the essence of the answer key's point about preferences changing between healthy and sick states.

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

Prospect theory suggests that individuals often downplay the significance of low probabilities. Specifically, they may underestimate moderate low probabilities (like 10%), while viewing extremely low probabilities (such as 0.01%) as effectively impossible, leading them to ignore such risks entirely.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that moderate low probabilities (like 10%) are underestimated, when according to prospect theory they are actually overestimated.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that extremely low probabilities are treated as effectively impossible and ignored entirely.

Score: 0.5

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

In prospect theory, loss aversion refers to our inclination to steer clear of financial losses. This theory suggests that we evaluate outcomes based on how they're presented, particularly in terms of losses and gains. Losses feel significantly more painful, making us more driven to prevent them.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes loss aversion as avoiding losses and mentions that losses feel more painful, but fails to specifically explain that this reflects negative utilities being weighed more heavily than positive utilities or that the value function is steeper for losses than gains in terms of utility.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

The primary distinction between these theories is that expected value theory focuses on how individuals make financial choices involving money, while expected utility theory addresses decisions that don't involve finances. Another key difference is that expected value theory views monetary outcomes in terms of gains and losses, unlike expected utility theory, which deals with non-monetary factors.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory focuses on financial/monetary choices while expected utility theory addresses broader decision-making beyond just financial outcomes, which aligns with the answer key's distinction between financial and non-financial values.
- Incorrect: The student discusses gains/losses framing and monetary vs non-monetary factors, but fails to address the key distinction about risk aversion and heuristics/biases that differentiates how the two theories handle decision-making under uncertainty.

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesnâ€™t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected value theory examines financial decision-making when outcomes and probabilities are consistent. Expected utility theory looks at non-financial choices under the same conditions. Multi-attribute theory explores decisions where each option has varying weights and probabilities. Prospect theory analyzes financial decisions while accounting for human biases and mental shortcuts.

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies expected value theory as dealing with financial outcomes and probabilities, capturing the essential normative nature of the model.
- Correct: Student accurately describes expected utility theory as extending beyond financial outcomes to non-financial/subjective utilities, showing understanding of the key difference from expected value theory.
- Incorrect: Student mentions 'varying weights and probabilities' but misses the key concept that multi-attribute utility theory deals with multiple attributes per option, each with utilities and weights, rather than probabilities.
- Incorrect: Student correctly identifies prospect theory as accounting for biases and mental shortcuts, but incorrectly limits it to financial decisions when it actually applies to utility-based decisions more broadly like expected utility theory.

Score: 0.5

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease peopleâ€™s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to our inclination to prevent losses, which influences how risk-averse we are, often making us more cautious and less willing to take risks.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion affects risk aversion, but gets the direction wrong. They claim loss aversion makes people 'more cautious and less willing to take risks,' while the answer key indicates that loss aversion actually decreases risk aversion and can make people risk-seeking when trying to avoid losses.

Score: 0.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning is about learning that two events or stimuli are connected. In classical conditioning, a neutral stimulus becomes tied to a behavior that's typically unrelated. With operant conditioning, a specific action is linked to a resulting reward or punishment.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as learning connections/associations between events or stimuli, which aligns with the answer key's definition of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as a neutral stimulus becoming tied to a behavior, which captures the essence of learning associations when things happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as linking specific actions to resulting rewards or punishments, which matches the answer key's definition of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation happens when someone mistakenly believes there's a cause-and-effect link between two events that are only correlated, creating a false pattern. Meanwhile, an illusory correlation occurs when someone perceives a connection between two unrelated events.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly distinguishes that illusory causation involves misinterpreting an actual correlation as causation ('mistakenly believes there's a cause-and-effect link between two events that are only correlated'), while illusory correlation involves perceiving a connection between variables that don't actually correlate ('perceives a connection between two unrelated events'). The core distinction is accurately captured.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to â€˜properlyâ€™ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

The Dutch healthcare system serves as an example of a schema, as it forms mental connections and provides context for real-world scenarios, guiding appropriate behavior. This schema helps individuals grasp the steps needed to access and use healthcare in the Netherlands. In contrast, knowing how to act at a birthday party illustrates a scriptâ€”a more specialized type of schema tied to social interactions, like birthdays, which can vary across cultures.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the Dutch healthcare system as a schema and provides appropriate reasoning about it forming mental connections and providing context, which aligns with the answer key's explanation about knowledge and relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies birthday party behavior as a script and accurately describes it as a specialized type of schema tied to social interactions and specific situations, which matches the answer key's explanation about scripts being social schemas for specific behavioral situations.

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

Daniel Dennett's levels of analysis suggest that behaviorists should take a physical stance, interpreting observations and ideas based on individuals' physical actions and behaviors.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that behaviorists adopted the physical stance and provides appropriate reasoning by explaining that this stance involves interpreting observations based on physical actions and behaviors, which aligns with behaviorism's focus on observable stimulus-response processes.

Score: 1.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

According to Dennett's levels of analysis, evolutionary psychologists ought to take an evolutionary perspective. This involves basing their observations and ideas on evolutionary benefits and historical patterns.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student does not identify the design stance specifically. While they correctly mention that evolutionary psychologists focus on evolutionary benefits and function, they fail to name the specific stance from Dennett's framework. The answer key requires identification of the design stance because evolutionary psychologists consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

When I pet my cat, it typically purrs every time. The purring happens right when and where I scratch it, not at another time or place. From what I know, scratching is what usually causes cats to purr.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student does not mention distinctness/specificity as a heuristic. They only provide an example without identifying this as one of the five heuristics.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention consistency as a heuristic. While their example demonstrates consistency ('typically purrs every time'), they don't identify it as a heuristic.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention plausibility as a heuristic. While their example shows plausible reasoning ('from what I know'), they don't identify plausibility as one of the heuristics.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention contiguity in time and space as a heuristic. Although their example demonstrates this ('right when and where I scratch it'), they don't identify it as a heuristic.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention similarity in cause and effect as a heuristic. This concept is completely absent from their response.

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

The tendency to overestimate moral outrage on social media is partly due to our negativity bias, which makes us more likely to focus on negative content. Since moral outrage messages are filled with negativity, we're naturally drawn to them.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias and accurately describes it as the tendency to focus on or be drawn to negative information, including morally outraged content.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention the availability heuristic, which is the second key bias that contributes to overestimating moral outrage frequency.
- Incorrect: The student does not explain how the two biases work together - specifically how negativity bias increases exposure to examples of moral outrage, which then leads the availability heuristic to cause overestimation of frequency.

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A delusional conspiracy theory is one that is highly unlikely and rooted in delusion. In contrast, a non-delusional conspiracy theory is based on something that could actually happen.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student focuses on likelihood/plausibility rather than the key distinction of irrationality combined with lack of common acceptance. The answer misses that the classification depends on whether the belief is both irrational AND not commonly accepted, not just on whether it 'could actually happen.'

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you donâ€™t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Mistakes in initial responses can disrupt learning due to the primacy effect, which means we tend to remember the first information we encounter more vividly. When an incorrect answer is given first, it sticks in our memory more firmly, making it harder to recall the correct answer later.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the primacy effect as the mechanism. The primacy effect refers to better recall of items at the beginning of a list, not the interference of incorrect information with correct learning. The correct mechanisms are source amnesia (forgetting that an answer was incorrect), proactive interference (initial incorrect answers interfering with later correct ones), or the continued-influence effect.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

Politicians aim to enhance the appeal of their message through repetition, leveraging the recency effect to achieve this. The recency effect describes how people tend to recall the most recent information they've encountered. By continuously repeating their message and ensuring it's widely seen, politicians increase the chances that their message will remain fresh in people's minds over extended periods.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the recency effect as the mechanism. The recency effect relates to better recall of recently presented information, not increased preference through familiarity. The correct answer should be mere exposure effect or illusory-truth effect, which explain how repetition increases attractiveness and perceived truthfulness respectively.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) tend to exaggerate the probability of negative events occurring because they have an external locus of control. This means they feel that events are beyond their influence, leading them to believe that bad outcomes are more probable.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that people with MDD exaggerate the probability of negative events, when the answer key indicates they are actually more accurate due to reduced optimism bias. The student also incorrectly attributes this to external locus of control rather than discussing accuracy in predictions.

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

When our senses become less reliable, we rely more on our existing beliefs to interpret what we perceive. If these beliefs dominate our perception, it can result in incorrect stereotypes formed from past experiences and gut feelings, even without solid sensory proof to back them up.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when sensory reliability decreases, prior beliefs have increased influence on perception. They demonstrate understanding that unreliable sensory information leads to greater reliance on existing beliefs/expectations, which matches the core concept in the answer key.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You donâ€™t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other peopleâ€™s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

Kohlberg outlines three stages of moral development. In the pre-conventional stage, individuals lack a sense of reciprocity and only act in their own self-interest. During the conventional stage, people begin to grasp and practice reciprocity, displaying basic moral behavior. Finally, in the post-conventional stage, individuals recognize that morality is universal, though moral principles and instincts can vary among different people.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the pre-conventional level and describes it as focusing on self-interest, which aligns with the answer key's description of avoiding punishment or gaining rewards.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the conventional level and describes it as grasping reciprocity and displaying basic moral behavior, which corresponds to the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the post-conventional level and describes it as recognizing universal morality with varying principles, which matches the answer key's focus on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model fuels hindsight bias by making us see connections between events. When we think something caused a past event, we assume the same pattern will repeat, leading us to believe we could have predicted and stopped it.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a causal model involves seeing connections between events, which aligns with the concept of a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Incorrect: While the student mentions causal models making us believe we could have predicted events, they don't clearly explain that causal models make past events seem more inevitable than they actually were, which is the key mechanism of hindsight bias.

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Hindsight bias is influenced by learning. When a similar event has occurred previously, we become aware of it and gain knowledge from it. This makes us believe the event was predictable and avoidable, assuming we should have applied past lessons.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes how past learning makes events seem predictable in hindsight, but doesn't address the key mechanism: that when estimating what we knew before, we cannot avoid incorporating newly learned information into those retrospective judgments.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing means aiming for the best possible choice, while satisficing means settling for a choice that's good enough. People with high neuroticism tend to have a maximizing decision style because they often feel stressed and pressured to always pick the perfect option.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines maximizing as 'aiming for the best possible choice' which aligns with 'trying to make the best choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as 'settling for a choice that's good enough' which matches 'making a good-enough choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people with high neuroticism tend to adopt a maximizing decision style and provides reasonable justification about feeling stressed and pressured to pick the perfect option.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

From what I've learned in this course, I'd apply the concept of nudges. Nudges gently guide people toward a certain action or decision. For instance, if I assigned my students a writing task, I might ask them to list each group member's contributions and provide a timeline for completing the assignment. This subtle prompt, rooted in libertarian paternalism, encourages students to put in more effort and stay engaged with the course content.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement with the question by applying a specific concept from the course (nudges and libertarian paternalism) to a practical teaching scenario. They provide a concrete example of how to structure assignments to encourage student engagement while working within resource constraints. The answer shows understanding of behavioral concepts and their application to educational settings.
