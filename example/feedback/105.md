## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

System 1 forms moral judgments quickly based on intuition and feelings. System 2 follows by providing a rational explanation for those judgments. According to this model, System 1 plays the primary role.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 is based on intuition and feelings, which aligns with the answer key's requirement that System 1 refers to intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student correctly describes System 2 as providing rational explanation, which corresponds to the answer key's definition of System 2 as reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student clearly states that 'System 1 plays the primary role,' which directly satisfies the answer key requirement that System 1 is more dominant than System 2.

Score: 1.0

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

Representative heuristic, because the colleague resembles a typical example of a representative group (fashion models).

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process, though with a minor spelling variation ('Representative' instead of 'Representativeness').
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of the heuristic by explaining that it involves judging category membership based on resemblance to a typical example or stereotype of that group.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

An anchor is a reference point that individuals use to process new information. The primacy effect describes the tendency to remember the initial words in a list more clearly than those that follow, which occurs because people focus their attention on the first word as a starting point.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as using a reference point to process new information, which aligns with the answer key's description of taking the first piece of information as a starting point.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as the tendency to remember initial items better, which matches the answer key's definition of better remembering the first piece of information.
- Incorrect: The student does not explicitly identify what anchoring and the primacy effect have in common, failing to mention their shared characteristic of overreliance on first information.

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency for losses to feel more significant than equivalent gains. Risk aversion is the preference to avoid taking risks due to uncertainty. Although risk aversion is relevant when the risks are known, loss aversion can serve as a broader underlying drive.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves losses feeling more significant than equivalent gains, which matches the answer key's definition of weighing losses more heavily than gains.
- Correct: The student accurately defines risk aversion as the preference to avoid taking risks due to uncertainty, which aligns with the answer key's definition of preferring certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 1.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias refers to the tendency of individuals to exaggerate the duration and intensity of their emotional reactions. In the context of a breakup, this means that people who are unhappy in their relationship may avoid ending it because they anticipate their emotional distress will be greater and longer-lasting than it actually will be.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies impact bias as the tendency to overestimate emotional reactions, which aligns with the answer key's definition of overestimating the impact of future events on future feelings.
- Correct: The student accurately explains how impact bias prevents breakups by describing that people overestimate how bad and long-lasting their emotional distress will be, which matches the answer key's point about overestimating how bad a breakup will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves anticipating how one will feel in the future. This concept is particularly relevant in end-of-life decisions when a person cannot express their wishes. In such cases, having a living will can be very useful.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies affective forecasting as anticipating how one will feel in the future, which matches the key point about predictions of future emotional state.
- Incorrect: The student discusses living wills and situations where people cannot express wishes, but fails to address the key concept that healthy people may predict preferring death when sick, yet change their preference when actually ill.

Score: 0.5

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

People tend to underestimate small probabilities. They don't make much distinction between "somewhat low" and "very low" probabilities, as prospect theory suggests that individuals prefer the option that appears most certain.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student states people underestimate small probabilities, but the answer key indicates that merely low probabilities are often overestimated according to prospect theory.
- Incorrect: The student claims people don't distinguish between somewhat low and very low probabilities, but the answer key specifies that extremely low probabilities are treated differently (as impossibilities) compared to merely low probabilities.

Score: 0.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Prospect theory explains how individuals make decisions between different options. In this theory, utility refers to the value or satisfaction derived from those options. Loss aversion means that people feel losses more intensely than gains. As a result, individuals tend to avoid risk when making choices.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion means people feel losses more intensely than gains, which captures the core concept that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities in prospect theory's value function.

Score: 1.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected utility theory considers risk preferences by assigning subjective values to the available options.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student does not address the distinction between financial and non-financial values, which is a key difference between expected value and expected utility theory.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected utility theory considers risk preferences through subjective values, which aligns with the concept of risk aversion mentioned in the answer key.

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected value theory involves calculating the average outcome, weighted by probability. Expected utility theory focuses on decisions based on the anticipated utility, factoring in risk. The fast-and-frugal approach emphasizes rapid decision-making using straightforward heuristics. Dual-process models propose two types of decision-making systems (type 1 and type 2).

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies expected value theory as involving probability-weighted outcomes, though lacks mention of it being normative or specifically about financial outcomes.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies expected utility theory as focusing on utility and factoring in risk, capturing the key difference from expected value theory.
- Incorrect: Student mentions 'fast-and-frugal approach' instead of multi-attribute utility theory. This is a completely different model not covered in the answer key.
- Incorrect: Student mentions 'dual-process models' instead of prospect theory. While dual-process models relate to decision-making, this is not the descriptive behavioral model with heuristics and biases described in the answer key.

Score: 0.5

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Individuals with high loss aversion perceive losses as more significant than gains. This influences their willingness to take risks, leading them to prefer the safest choice and avoid uncertainty.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that loss aversion leads people to prefer the safest choice and avoid uncertainty. The answer key indicates that loss aversion actually decreases risk aversion and can make people risk-seeking when trying to avoid potential losses, which is the opposite of what the student described.

Score: 0.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves learning to associate a particular response with a certain stimulus. In classical conditioning, this association is formed by presenting a stimulus alongside a natural response. In operant conditioning, the link is created through the use of rewards or punishments following a behavior.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that conditioning involves learning associations, though they phrase it in terms of stimulus-response rather than covariation. This captures the core concept.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of classical conditioning as forming associations between stimuli and responses through co-presentation, which aligns with the concept of learning associations when things happen together.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning through rewards or punishments following behavior, which matches the answer key's description of learning that actions cause consequences.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation involves perceiving that A causes B, whereas illusory correlation refers to noticing a relationship between two events without understanding the direction of influence between A and B.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly describes illusory correlation as 'noticing a relationship between two events without understanding the direction of influence.' This confuses illusory correlation with issues of causal direction. Illusory correlation actually refers to perceiving a correlation that doesn't exist at all, not misunderstanding the direction of an existing relationship.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

Comprehending the Dutch healthcare systems is considered a schema, as it is a mental framework that arranges knowledge and sets expectations. Recognizing the appropriate conduct at a birthday party is a script, since it is a specific form of schema designed to understand and predict routine occurrences.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the Dutch healthcare system as a schema and provides an accurate explanation that it is a mental framework for organizing knowledge, which aligns with the answer key's emphasis on knowledge and relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies birthday party behavior as a script and accurately explains it as a specific type of schema for understanding routine occurrences, which matches the answer key's description of scripts as social schemas for specific situational behavior.

Score: 1.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

Intentional stance, as the behavior demonstrates the mind's intention based on behaviorist principles.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the intentional stance, which focuses on beliefs, desires, and intentions. Behaviorists explicitly rejected studying mental states and intentions, instead focusing on observable stimulus-response mechanisms, which corresponds to the physical stance.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

Design stance, as it emphasizes the functionality and design of the outcome, which in this case is shaped by evolutionary processes.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the design stance and provides an appropriate justification by explaining that evolutionary psychology emphasizes functionality and design outcomes shaped by evolutionary processes, which aligns with the answer key's point about considering psychological processes in terms of their function.

Score: 1.0

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Consensus refers to whether individuals respond similarly. Distinctiveness involves responses triggered only by a particular stimulus. Consistency means the same outcome occurs repeatedly under similar conditions. The simulation heuristic is a mental shortcut where people envision scenarios to determine cause and effect. Counterfactual reasoning is when people assess what might have happened in different situations by changing certain elements.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: Student mentions 'distinctiveness' but describes it as responses triggered by a particular stimulus rather than the causal heuristic where B follows A but not other events.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies consistency as the same outcome occurring repeatedly under similar conditions, which aligns with B always following A.
- Incorrect: Student does not mention plausibility as a heuristic for judging causation based on common sense.
- Incorrect: Student does not mention contiguity in time and space as a heuristic for judging causation.
- Incorrect: Student does not mention similarity in cause and effect as a heuristic for judging causation.

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Availability bias: Making decisions influenced by how quickly examples or information are recalled.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student does not mention the negativity bias at all, which is one of the two primary biases identified in the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the availability heuristic (called 'availability bias') and provides an accurate definition about how easily recalled examples influence judgments.
- Incorrect: The student does not explain how these biases work together to cause overestimation of moral outrage on social media, missing the crucial connection between the two biases.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

This pertains to the impact of bacteria as seen in biology. It explains how bacteria can transfer to various objects or individuals. In this case, the same concept is applied, but shifted from biology to psychology.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a biological concept (bacteria transfer/contagion) is being incorrectly applied to the psychological/social domain, which matches the answer key's requirement to explain magical contagion as misapplying biological domain concepts to social/psychological domains.

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

Delusional conspiracy theories are those that are irrational or illogical. In contrast, non-delusional conspiracy theories involve a logical and coherent line of thinking, even though they are still considered conspiracy theories.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student only mentions irrationality as the distinguishing factor but fails to include the crucial element that a conspiracy theory must also be 'not commonly accepted' to be considered delusional. The answer key requires both conditions (irrational AND not commonly accepted) to distinguish delusional from non-delusional conspiracy theories.

Score: 0.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

Persistence of belief Neuroticism

Feedback:

- Incorrect: Persistence of belief is not listed among the specific cognitive and personality factors in the answer key for conspiratorial thinking.
- Incorrect: Neuroticism is not listed among the specific cognitive and personality factors in the answer key for conspiratorial thinking.
- Incorrect: The student only provided two factors, but the question requires naming three factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Blocking occurs when the process of acquiring new information is hindered due to interference from previously learned knowledge.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes blocking as a general interference phenomenon but does not specifically address the key mechanism from the answer key. The answer lacks mention of source amnesia (forgetting that an incorrect answer was wrong), proactive interference (incorrect answers interfering with correct ones), or the continued-influence effect. The response is too general and doesn't capture the specific psychological mechanism by which incorrect quiz answers can interfere with learning the correct information.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

Repeated exposure. When statements are presented numerous times, they tend to become more appealing.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies repeated exposure as the mechanism, which aligns with the mere exposure effect from the answer key. The explanation that repeated statements become more appealing demonstrates understanding of how familiarity increases preference.

Score: 1.0

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

No, because individuals considered "normal" tend to have an unrealistic sense of optimism, viewing their future in a positive light. In contrast, those with major depressive disorder lack this bias and are likely to make more accurate predictions about the future.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people with major depressive disorder are more accurate at predictions because they lack the unrealistic optimism bias that characterizes non-depressed individuals, which aligns with the answer key's point about reduced overly optimistic tendencies.

Score: 1.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

Perception is increasingly shaped by existing beliefs.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that prior beliefs have increased influence on perception when sensory information becomes less reliable, demonstrating understanding of the key concept even though the answer is brief.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

Pre-conventional level: Moral decisions are influenced by rewards and punishments. Conventional level: Moral decisions are guided by social rules and the desire to be accepted by others. Post-conventional level: Moral decisions are founded on overarching principles such as justice.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the pre-conventional level as being influenced by rewards and punishments, which aligns with the answer key's description of obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as being guided by social rules and desire for acceptance, which matches the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the post-conventional level as being founded on overarching principles like justice, which corresponds to the answer key's description of focus on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

The causal model of past events describes how easily you can link causes and effects in your mind, resulting in hindsight bias.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes causal models in terms of 'linking causes and effects' but doesn't capture that it's specifically a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that causal models result in hindsight bias, though they don't explain the mechanism of events seeming more inevitable.

Score: 0.5

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Gaining new information leads to hindsight bias because the recently acquired knowledge is unconsciously considered when looking back at past events, making those events seem more predictable than they really were.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that newly learned information is unconsciously incorporated when evaluating past events, which aligns with the key concept that you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account when estimating past likelihood judgments.

Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing involves selecting the option that aims to achieve the best possible outcome, whereas satisficing means choosing an option that is merely adequate. Individuals with high levels of neuroticism are likely to use a maximizing approach to decision-making.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as selecting the option that aims to achieve the best possible outcome, which aligns with 'trying to make the best choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as choosing an option that is merely adequate, which corresponds to 'making a good-enough choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that individuals with high neuroticism are likely to use a maximizing approach, which matches the answer key's assertion that high neuroticism leads to adopting the maximizing decision style.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

I would take the same approach. It was a great chance to create a report for the RUW and evaluate other students' papers as well. This helped me gain a better understanding of the Judgement & Decision Making course. The feedback and grading were done by students rather than a teacher, which I was comfortable with. I believed that, since we share a similar level of knowledge, they could provide feedback just as effectively as a teacher.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement by reflecting on their experience with peer assessment, acknowledging its benefits for understanding course material, and recognizing how student feedback can be effective. They show thoughtful consideration of how peer evaluation can address resource constraints while maintaining educational value.
