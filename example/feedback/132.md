## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

The social-intuitionist model suggests that system 1 is the most influential. You first make judgments intuitively through system 1. Then, system 2 steps in afterward to provide explanations for why you believe something is the case.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student does not explicitly define what System 1 thinking refers to (intuitions/emotion), only mentioning that judgments are made 'intuitively' without clearly stating System 1 = intuitions/emotion.
- Incorrect: The student does not explicitly define what System 2 thinking refers to (reasoning/rational thought), only mentioning that System 2 'provides explanations' without clearly stating System 2 = reasoning/rational thought.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 is most dominant/influential according to Haidt's model, stating 'system 1 is the most influential.'

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

Representativeness heuristic occurs when you categorize someone based on preexisting mental groups or stereotypes.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process in this scenario.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that representativeness heuristic involves categorizing someone based on preexisting mental groups or stereotypes, which captures the essence of estimating likelihood based on resemblance to category stereotypes.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring serves as a reference point that guides your decision-making. The primacy effect refers to the initial information you encounter, which can establish an anchor by shaping your perception based on what you learn first.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that anchoring serves as a reference point that guides decision-making, which aligns with the concept of taking the first piece of information as a starting point.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as relating to initial information encountered, which corresponds to the tendency to better remember first information.
- Correct: The student explicitly connects both concepts by explaining how primacy effect can establish an anchor through first information shaping perception, demonstrating understanding of their common overreliance on first information.

Score: 1.0

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the fear of losing something, while risk aversion is the fear of engaging in risky situations. The key distinction is that loss aversion doesn’t prevent you from taking risks.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes loss aversion as 'fear of losing something' which is too vague and doesn't capture the key concept that losses are weighted more heavily than equivalent gains. The answer misses the fundamental asymmetry between losses and gains.
- Incorrect: The student describes risk aversion as 'fear of engaging in risky situations' which is imprecise. Risk aversion is specifically about preferring certainty over uncertainty, not a general 'fear' of risk. The characterization lacks the precision of preferring certain outcomes over uncertain ones with equivalent expected value.

Score: 0.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias refers to the tendency to overestimate how strongly future events will affect your emotions. This bias might stop people from ending relationships, as they believe the breakup will make them feel even worse later on.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as the tendency to overestimate how strongly future events will affect emotions, which matches the answer key's definition of overestimating the impact of future events on future feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly explains that impact bias prevents breakups because people believe the breakup will make them feel worse than it actually will, which aligns with the answer key's point about overestimating how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves anticipating your future emotional responses. This is crucial in end-of-life choices because individuals often struggle to accurately foresee their future feelings. As a result, someone might make a decision but experience very different emotions about it later in life.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies affective forecasting as anticipating or predicting future emotional responses, which aligns with the answer key's definition of 'predictions about our own future emotional state.'
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of the core concept that people struggle to accurately predict their future emotions and may feel differently later than expected, which captures the essence of the answer key's example about healthy vs. sick preferences regarding end-of-life decisions.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

Prospect theory suggests that individuals tend to overvalue small probabilities. Typically, moderately low probabilities are overestimated more often than very tiny probabilities.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that moderately low probabilities are overestimated, which aligns with the answer key's point about merely low probabilities being overestimated.
- Incorrect: The student mentions that very tiny probabilities are overestimated less than moderately low probabilities, but fails to capture the key insight that extremely low probabilities are often treated as impossibilities rather than just being less overestimated.

Score: 0.5

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion is a negative concept, so any outcome involving losses will be assigned a low level of utility.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly describes loss aversion as simply assigning low utility to losses. The key concept is that losses are weighed more heavily than equivalent gains (asymmetric weighting), not just that losses have low utility. The student misses the comparative/relative nature of loss aversion.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Firstly, expected value theory primarily deals with financial choices, like gambling. In contrast, expected utility theory applies not only to monetary decisions but also to other situations, such as deciding whether to bring an umbrella. Secondly, expected utility theory assigns a utility (a measure of importance) to each possible outcome.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory deals with financial choices while expected utility theory applies to both monetary and non-monetary situations, using the umbrella example to illustrate non-financial decisions.
- Incorrect: The student mentions that expected utility theory assigns utility to outcomes but fails to address the key distinction about risk aversion or heuristics and biases that differentiate the theories' treatment of decision-making under uncertainty.

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

1. Expected value theory describes the optimal result based solely on financial choices. 2. Expected utility theory describes the optimal result by considering the utility or satisfaction individuals assign to a decision. 3. Multiple attributes utility theory (MAUT) describes the optimal outcome by taking into account various attributes and their respective utilities. 4. Prospect theory describes the optimal outcome while incorporating the heuristics and biases that influence people's decisions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as focusing on financial outcomes, though they miss mentioning probabilities and that it's a normative model for choosing between options.
- Correct: The student correctly explains that expected utility theory considers utility/satisfaction rather than just financial outcomes, capturing the key difference from expected value theory.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that MAUT involves multiple attributes and their utilities, though they don't mention the weighting aspect of attributes.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly describes prospect theory as finding the 'optimal outcome' when it's actually a descriptive/behavioral model that explains how people actually make decisions (not optimal ones) under heuristics and biases.

Score: 0.75

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Loss aversion can make individuals more cautious, as the fear of loss leads them to avoid taking risks that might result in any kind of loss.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that loss aversion makes people more risk averse and cautious. The answer key indicates that loss aversion actually decreases risk aversion and can make people risk-seeking when they face potential losses, as they become willing to accept risks to avoid those losses.

Score: 0.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves learning to connect two events, so that when one event occurs, you anticipate the other will happen. Classical conditioning is the process of linking two stimuli together, like a dog learning that the sound of a bell means food is coming. Operant conditioning, on the other hand, involves learning based on consequences, such as rewards or punishments.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as learning connections/associations between events, which aligns with the key concept of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as linking two stimuli together and provides a relevant example (bell and food), demonstrating understanding of temporal/spatial association.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning based on consequences like rewards or punishments, matching the answer key's description of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation occurs when you believe that A caused B simply because B followed A. Illusory correlation, on the other hand, means that A and B appear to be linked, but one does not necessarily cause the other.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly defines illusory causation as believing A caused B because B followed A (post hoc fallacy), when it should be incorrectly interpreting an actual correlation as causation. The definition of illusory correlation is also incorrect - the student describes it as variables appearing linked without causation, but it should be perceiving correlation between variables that don't actually correlate at all.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

Comprehending the Dutch healthcare system involves using a schema, which is a knowledge structure that can be updated as new information is received. Knowing the appropriate behavior at a birthday party is an example of a script, which guides actions in specific situations and is influenced by cultural norms.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the Dutch healthcare system as a schema and provides an accurate explanation that it is a knowledge structure, which aligns with the answer key's description of schemas as knowledge and relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies birthday party behavior as a script and accurately explains that scripts guide actions in specific situations and are influenced by cultural norms, which matches the answer key's description of scripts as social schemas for specific situational behavior.

Score: 1.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

Behaviorists believe that people are capable of change, as their primary focus is on how behavior can be modified in particular ways.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's answer discusses behavioral modification and capacity for change, but completely fails to address the core question about which of Dennett's stances behaviorists adopted. The answer does not mention the physical stance or explain why behaviorists focused on stimulus-response processes rather than mental states.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

Evolutionary psychologists believe that individuals can only change in ways that enhance their chances of survival. They hold this view because they see it as rooted in evolutionary principles.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student answer does not address Dennett's stances or levels of analysis at all, and instead discusses evolutionary principles in general terms. The answer completely misses the core question about which of Dennett's three stances (physical, design, or intentional) evolutionary psychologists adopt, and fails to identify the design stance or explain that evolutionary psychologists consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Availability heuristic > Judging based on the number of examples you can remember. Representativeness heuristic > Assessing whether something matches the categories you have established. Outcome bias > Believing that the cause of an event was obvious after knowing the result. Confirmation bias > Looking for information that supports your existing beliefs. Anchoring-and-adjustment > Beginning with an initial reference point and then making changes from there.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: Student provided availability heuristic instead of distinctness/specificity. The availability heuristic is about memory accessibility, not about whether B follows A but not other events.
- Incorrect: Student provided representativeness heuristic instead of consistency. Representativeness is about category matching, not about whether B always follows A.
- Incorrect: Student provided outcome bias instead of plausibility. Outcome bias is about hindsight judgment, not about common sense plausibility of causal relationships.
- Incorrect: Student provided confirmation bias instead of contiguity in time and space. Confirmation bias is about selective information seeking, not about temporal and spatial proximity of events.
- Incorrect: Student provided anchoring-and-adjustment instead of similarity in cause and effect. Anchoring is about reference points in judgment, not about superficial resemblance between cause and effect.

Score: 0.0

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Availability bias occurs when certain examples come to mind easily, while confirmation bias involves looking for information that supports your existing beliefs. If you specifically search for morally outraged individuals on social media, you'll find plenty, making those examples easy to remember. In this way, confirmation and availability biases reinforce each other.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions availability bias but calls it 'availability bias' instead of 'availability heuristic', and while they correctly describe it as examples coming to mind easily, they don't connect it to estimating frequency or probability.
- Incorrect: The student identifies confirmation bias instead of negativity bias. While confirmation bias involves seeking information that supports existing beliefs, the answer key specifically requires negativity bias - the tendency to seek out or place more weight on negative information.
- Incorrect: The student attempts to explain how the two biases work together, but since they identified the wrong second bias (confirmation instead of negativity), their explanation doesn't match the required mechanism of negativity bias increasing examples of moral outrage that availability heuristic then uses for overestimation.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

When you choose to avoid items that once belonged to someone you strongly dislike, you apply knowledge from one field to another. In this situation, you are moving understanding from the biological realm (contagion) to the psychological realm.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that biological domain knowledge about contagion is being applied to the psychological domain, which matches the answer key's requirement to explain this as incorrect application of contagion concepts across domains.

Score: 1.0

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

The difference between a delusional conspiracy theory and a non-delusional conspiracy lies in the fact that a non-delusional conspiracy can be supported by factual evidence.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student focuses only on factual evidence as the distinguishing factor, but misses the key criteria from the answer key: that a delusional conspiracy theory must be both an irrational belief AND not commonly accepted. The student's answer is incomplete and doesn't address the social acceptance component.

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

1. Identifying as male 2. Self-centered 3. Belonging to a specific group

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies gender (being male) as a factor contributing to conspiratorial thinking, which matches 'being a man' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student mentions 'self-centered' which aligns with narcissism from the answer key, as being self-centered is a core characteristic of narcissistic personality traits.
- Incorrect: The student mentions 'belonging to a specific group' which is not listed among the cognitive and personality factors in the answer key. This appears to be a social/demographic factor rather than a cognitive or personality factor.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Receiving feedback leads to an adjustment in your schema, enabling you to provide the correct answer in the future.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes how feedback helps learning rather than how incorrect answers interfere with learning. The answer does not mention source amnesia, proactive interference, or the continued-influence effect, which are the psychological mechanisms by which incorrect answers can actually hinder learning.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

The more frequently you encounter something, the more likely you are to develop a preference for it, which can lead you to believe it is true.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the core mechanism of mere exposure - that frequent encounters with something lead to increased preference for it. The student also mentions the connection to believing it is true, which relates to the illusory-truth effect mentioned as an alternative answer in the key.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Major depressive disorder can cause individuals to be less accurate when making predictions. The information they rely on to form these predictions is often more heavily influenced by the disorder.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that major depressive disorder makes people less accurate at predictions, when the correct answer is that people with MDD are actually more accurate due to reduced optimism bias. The student's answer directly contradicts the key finding about depressive realism.

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

As the accuracy of sensory data declines, the impact of existing beliefs becomes stronger.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when sensory information becomes less reliable (described as 'accuracy of sensory data declines'), prior beliefs have a greater influence on perception (described as 'impact of existing beliefs becomes stronger'). This demonstrates understanding of the key principle in the ideal-observer model.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

1. Preconventional level: At this stage, you understand which actions bring rewards or punishments. 2. Conventional level: Here, you learn to obey laws and strive to behave well to gain approval from others. 3. Postconventional level: At this point, you develop a strong sense of moral judgment and may choose to act based on what feels right, even if it means disregarding legal rules.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the preconventional level as focusing on rewards and punishments, which aligns with the answer key's description of obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as involving obedience to laws and seeking approval from others, which matches the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly describes the postconventional level as developing moral judgment and acting based on what feels right even when it conflicts with legal rules, which aligns with the answer key's focus on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model of past events involves believing that event A leads to event B. This influences hindsight because recognizing a cause-and-effect connection makes the outcome seem unavoidable.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a causal model involves cause-and-effect relationships between events (A leads to B), which captures the essence of a coherent narrative linking past events.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that recognizing cause-and-effect connections makes outcomes seem unavoidable, which directly addresses how causal models contribute to hindsight bias by making events appear more inevitable.

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Once you acquire knowledge, you can't "unlearn" it, a phenomenon known as the curse of knowledge. This plays a role in hindsight bias, as gaining information makes it hard to forget, leading to the tendency to see events as more predictable after they have happened.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that newly learned information cannot be avoided when making past likelihood judgments, explicitly mentions the curse of knowledge, and accurately explains how this contributes to hindsight bias by making events seem more predictable in retrospect.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing involves seeking the optimal result, while satisficing means selecting an option that is good enough. Individuals with high levels of neuroticism are more inclined to use a maximizing approach to decision-making.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as seeking the optimal result, which aligns with 'trying to make the best choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as selecting an option that is good enough, which matches 'making a good-enough choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that individuals with high neuroticism are more inclined to use a maximizing approach, which matches the answer key's prediction.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

Each week, I would assign tasks to the students that their peers would assess. This approach encourages active learning and promotes peer feedback, enhancing the overall learning experience.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement by proposing a specific, practical solution (peer assessment) that directly addresses the constraints mentioned in the question (limited time and resources while promoting active engagement). The answer shows understanding of pedagogical principles and offers a feasible approach to the teaching challenge presented.
