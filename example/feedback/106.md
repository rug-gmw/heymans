## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

System 1 is a quick and instinctive mode of thinking that is shaped by biases and mental shortcuts. It is useful for making moral decisions rapidly. In contrast, System 2 operates more slowly and deliberately, demanding greater effort and time, and is suitable for moral judgments that require careful consideration. This model suggests that System 1 tends to be more influential since it enables immediate, intuitive choices.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies System 1 as 'quick and instinctive' thinking that enables 'immediate, intuitive choices,' which aligns with the answer key's description of System 1 as intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student accurately describes System 2 as operating 'slowly and deliberately, demanding greater effort' and being suitable for 'careful consideration,' which matches the answer key's characterization of System 2 as reasoning/rational thought.
- Correct: The student states that 'System 1 tends to be more influential,' which correctly identifies System 1 as more dominant than System 2, satisfying the third point from the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

The representativeness heuristic occurs when a person assumes that an object fits into a particular category because it closely resembles the typical members of that category.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process in this scenario.
- Correct: The student accurately explains the representativeness heuristic as making category judgments based on resemblance to typical category members, which captures the essence of estimating likelihood based on stereotype similarity.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring occurs when an initial piece of information shapes your initial belief. The primacy effect happens when your overall impression is influenced by the first information you encounter. Both highlight how initial information strongly affects how we make judgments and decisions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that anchoring involves initial information shaping beliefs/judgments, which aligns with the answer key's description of taking first information as a starting point.
- Incorrect: The student describes primacy effect as influencing overall impressions rather than specifically about memory/remembering first information better, which is what the answer key requires.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both concepts involve initial information strongly affecting judgments and decisions, which captures the overreliance on first information theme from the answer key.

Score: 0.6666666666666666

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion occurs when you steer clear of a definite loss and choose the option that offers the highest gain. Here, you are certain to incur a loss with one of the choices. Risk aversion, on the other hand, involves avoiding the possibility of a loss by selecting the option that has the smallest likelihood of resulting in a loss. In this scenario, it is uncertain whether you will actually face a loss when making a decision.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly describes loss aversion as steering clear of definite loss to choose highest gain. Loss aversion actually refers to weighing losses more heavily than equivalent gains, not about choosing between certain loss and gain options.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly describes risk aversion as avoiding possibility of loss by selecting options with smallest likelihood of loss. Risk aversion is about preferring certainty over uncertainty in general, not specifically about minimizing loss probability.

Score: 0.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate how strongly a future event will affect one’s emotions. This exaggerated fear of the anticipated emotional response leads individuals to steer clear of the event whenever possible. For instance, in the case of a breakup, people may remain in an unhappy relationship because they are scared of the emotional consequences they expect to feel after ending it.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as overestimating how strongly a future event will affect emotions, which aligns with the answer key's definition of overestimating the impact of future events on future feelings.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that impact bias prevents breakups because people are scared of the emotional consequences they expect to feel, which matches the answer key's point about overestimating how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves predicting how we will feel emotionally in the future. This is crucial when making end-of-life decisions because emotions heavily impact these choices. The challenge lies in the fact that emotions can change rapidly (emotional evanescence). For instance, someone might feel deeply depressed upon becoming ill and decide to end their life, believing their sadness will persist. Yet, once they begin the process, they may become frightened or feel less depressed, leading them to reconsider and choose to continue living.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines affective forecasting as predicting how we will feel emotionally in the future, which matches the answer key's definition of predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of the core concept from the answer key by providing a relevant example showing how someone's emotional state and preferences can change from when they are ill and initially want to end their life to later reconsidering and choosing to live, which aligns with the key point about predictions versus actual preferences when sick.

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

People tend to overestimate small probabilities, thinking they are more likely to happen than they really are. However, this only applies to moderately low probabilities. When it comes to extremely low probabilities, individuals often consider them impossible, thereby underestimating the likelihood.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people overestimate small/low probabilities, which aligns with the answer key's point about merely low probabilities being overestimated.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that extremely low probabilities are often considered impossible, which matches the answer key's point about extremely low probabilities being interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency to select the option that minimizes negative feelings or losses.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes loss aversion as a behavioral tendency to minimize losses, but does not address the key concept that in prospect theory's utility framework, loss aversion specifically reflects that negative utilities are weighted more heavily than positive utilities or that the value function is steeper for losses than gains.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

1. Expected value theory considers only the monetary outcomes associated with various options, while expected utility theory additionally takes into account other benefits or drawbacks related to each choice that may not have monetary worth. 2.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory deals only with monetary/financial outcomes while expected utility theory considers non-monetary benefits and drawbacks, which aligns with the answer key distinction between financial and non-financial values.
- Incorrect: The student provided an incomplete answer for the second point, offering no explanation of the difference regarding heuristics/biases and risk aversion as specified in the answer key.

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

1. Expected value model: When faced with several choices, this model links each option to the likelihood of it being selected or occurring, along with its monetary value.  
2. Expected utility model: In situations with multiple options, this model associates each choice with the probability of its occurrence and the utilities it provides, which can include monetary value as well as factors like psychological effort.  
3. Multiple-attributes utility model: This model involves several options, each related to various attributes. Each attribute carries a weight and a utility, which, similar to the previous model, may extend beyond monetary value.  
4. Prospect model: Building on the expected utility model, this approach accounts for human errors such as biases and heuristics, illustrating how people actually make decisions in real life.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as linking options to probability and monetary value, which captures the essence of the normative model for financial outcomes.
- Correct: The student accurately describes expected utility theory as involving probability and utilities that extend beyond just monetary value to include subjective factors like psychological effort.
- Correct: The student correctly explains multi-attribute utility theory as involving multiple options with various attributes, each having weight and utility, matching the key concepts from the answer key.
- Correct: The student properly identifies prospect theory as building on expected utility theory while incorporating human biases and heuristics, and correctly notes it describes how people actually make decisions.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Individuals who are less fearful of losing or who seek the excitement of facing a loss tend to be less cautious about taking risks compared to those who fear loss.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student misunderstands loss aversion. They suggest people who are 'less fearful of losing' are less risk averse, but loss aversion theory states that people who strongly fear losses become risk-seeking when trying to avoid those losses, not that fearless people take more risks.

Score: 0.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves learning to connect two elements: 1. Classical conditioning refers to learning the link between two simultaneously occurring events. 2. Operant conditioning involves learning the relationship between an action and its resulting reward or punishment.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes conditioning as 'learning to connect two elements' which is too vague and doesn't capture the key concept of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies classical conditioning as learning links between simultaneously occurring events, which aligns with the answer key's description of associating things that happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student accurately describes operant conditioning as learning the relationship between actions and their resulting rewards or punishments, which matches the answer key.

Score: 0.6666666666666666

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation occurs when a person believes one event causes another, but in fact, they only occur simultaneously without any causal connection. Illusory correlation happens when someone assumes two events are related or occur together, even though they do not.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that illusory causation involves incorrectly inferring a causal relationship (believing one event causes another when they only occur simultaneously) and that illusory correlation involves perceiving a relationship between variables that don't actually correlate (assuming events are related when they are not). The core distinction between misinterpreting correlation as causation versus perceiving non-existent correlation is accurately captured.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

The first example is a schema, as it offers a mental structure for understanding something. It helps you quickly access information in new situations or events. The second example is a script, since it outlines a series of socially and culturally accepted guidelines to follow in familiar scenarios, such as a birthday party.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the Dutch healthcare system as a schema and provides an accurate explanation that it represents a mental structure for understanding and organizing knowledge.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies birthday party behavior as a script and accurately explains that it involves following socially and culturally accepted guidelines in familiar scenarios.

Score: 1.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

They took the physical perspective, viewing behavior as something that should be studied solely through observing physical characteristics and actions, rather than considering intentions and mental processes that cannot be directly seen by focusing only on physical aspects.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that behaviorists adopted the physical stance and provides accurate reasoning - they focused on observable physical behaviors and stimuli rather than unobservable mental processes, which aligns with the physical stance's emphasis on measurable, objective phenomena.

Score: 1.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

Evolutionary psychologists use the intentional stance since they view behavior as having a purpose or function. In this case, the goal of ingroup favoritism is to form protective groups, which benefits human survival.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the intentional stance instead of the design stance. While they correctly understand that evolutionary psychology focuses on function and purpose, the intentional stance refers to explaining behavior by attributing beliefs and desires to agents, whereas the design stance explains systems in terms of their functional design without necessarily attributing mental states.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

1. Temporal and spatial contingency: A happens before B, never vice versa. 2. Plausibility: It is reasonable to expect B to follow A based on everyday logic. 3. Specificity: A leads exclusively to B, and B is only triggered by A. 4. Consistency: A invariably comes before B, and B always follows A. 5. Covariation: A and B consistently appear together.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies contiguity in time and space, describing it as temporal and spatial contingency where A happens before B. This matches the answer key's concept of A and B occurring at the same time and location.
- Correct: The student accurately describes plausibility as it being reasonable to expect B to follow A based on everyday logic, which aligns with the answer key's definition using common sense.
- Correct: The student correctly captures specificity/distinctness by stating that A leads exclusively to B and B is only triggered by A, which matches the answer key's concept that B follows A but not other events.
- Correct: The student accurately describes consistency as A invariably coming before B and B always following A, which aligns with the answer key's definition that B always follows A.
- Incorrect: The student describes 'covariation' (A and B consistently appearing together) instead of 'similarity in cause and effect' (A and B superficially resembling each other). These are different concepts.

Score: 0.8

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

1. Negativity bias: we are naturally drawn to negative information, such as individuals expressing moral outrage. 2. Availability heuristic: we assume that something occurs more frequently or is more probable if it comes to mind easily. Because we frequently encounter negative content, like moral outrage, it becomes easier to remember. This availability leads us to overestimate how common moral outrage really is.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias and accurately describes it as being naturally drawn to negative information, specifically mentioning moral outrage content.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies availability heuristic and provides an accurate definition of estimating frequency based on how easily examples come to mind.
- Correct: The student effectively explains the connection between the two biases, showing how negativity bias makes moral outrage content more memorable, which then leads the availability heuristic to cause overestimation of its frequency.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

When a person encounters an item owned by someone they dislike, they automatically link that individual to the object. This leads them to view the object negatively, despite the fact that there is no logical reason to dislike it.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes the phenomenon of magical contagion but fails to explain it in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge. The answer does not mention the key concept that biological domain knowledge about contagion is being incorrectly applied to the social/psychological/cultural domain.

Score: 0.0

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

The number of people nearby who also accept a particular conspiracy theory influences perception. In the case of a delusional conspiracy theory, few people believe it, making those who do appear delusional. Conversely, if many people believe a theory, it leads others to view believers as reasonable rather than delusional, even if the theory lacks scientific validity.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that delusional conspiracy theories are distinguished by lack of common acceptance (few believers vs many believers), which aligns with the answer key's requirement that delusional theories are 'not commonly accepted.' While the student doesn't explicitly mention irrationality, they implicitly address this by noting that widespread belief can make theories seem reasonable 'even if the theory lacks scientific validity,' suggesting understanding of the rationality component.

Score: 1.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

1. Difficulty in thinking critically 2. Lack of confidence 3. Tendency to embrace conspiracy theories influenced by those in your environment

Feedback:

- Correct: The student's mention of 'difficulty in thinking critically' aligns with the answer key's 'having a low level of analytical thinking,' which is essentially the same concept expressed differently.
- Incorrect: The student's 'lack of confidence' does not match any of the specific factors listed in the answer key. The answer key includes narcissism (which suggests overconfidence rather than lack of confidence) but not general lack of confidence.
- Incorrect: The student's third point about 'tendency to embrace conspiracy theories influenced by those in your environment' describes social influence rather than the cognitive and personality factors specifically requested. This is more about external influence than internal cognitive/personality traits.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Due to the primacy effect, the information you acquire initially strongly affects your memory. Although you may learn new details later, the first information continues to significantly shape your current understanding of the correct answer, making it more difficult to discard any incorrect answers.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the primacy effect as the mechanism. The primacy effect refers to better recall of items at the beginning of a list, not the interference of incorrect information with correct learning. The answer key requires identification of source amnesia, proactive interference, or the continued-influence effect as the psychological mechanisms.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

The recency effect occurs because politicians repeatedly share the same information, providing people with fresh exposure each time. This repetition helps individuals retain the information more effectively.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the recency effect as the psychological mechanism. The correct answer is the mere exposure effect (tendency to prefer familiar things) or the illusory-truth effect. The recency effect refers to better recall of information presented last in a sequence, not the preference for familiar or repeatedly heard information.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Yes, individuals with major depressive disorder tend to overestimate the likelihood of negative events happening to them, leading to less accurate assessments of the actual risk.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that people with major depressive disorder overestimate negative events and are less accurate, when the answer key indicates they are actually more accurate due to reduced optimism bias compared to non-depressed individuals.

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

The impact of existing beliefs on how we perceive things increases.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that prior beliefs have increased influence on perception when sensory information becomes less reliable, which directly matches the key concept from the answer key.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

1. Pre-conventional: decisions are made based on the potential for rewards or punishments. 2. Conventional: moral choices are guided by societal norms and expectations. 3. Post-conventional: judgments are formed according to universal ethical principles.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the pre-conventional level and accurately describes it as being based on rewards and punishments, which matches the answer key's description of obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the conventional level and accurately describes it as being guided by societal norms and expectations, which aligns with the answer key's description of focusing on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the post-conventional level and accurately describes it as being based on universal ethical principles, which matches the answer key's description of focusing on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model arranges previous events in a cause-and-effect sequence to suggest that the present event was a result of those past occurrences. This leads to hindsight bias by causing people to think that the current event was bound to happen based on what happened before, fostering the idea that the outcome was unavoidable.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a causal model arranges past events in a cause-and-effect sequence, which aligns with the answer key's definition of a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that causal models contribute to hindsight bias by making people think events were 'bound to happen' and 'unavoidable,' which matches the answer key's point about events seeming more inevitable than they were.

Score: 1.0

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

When acquiring new information about an event, you frequently revise your memory of the preceding event to accommodate this new detail. This alters your understanding of how the event occurred. Upon discovering a link between the current event and a past event, you reinterpret it as logical that the current event followed the previous one, even if you wouldn't have thought this made sense without knowing about the connection. This leads to a hindsight bias, making the current event seem inevitable, even though that may not be accurate.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly explains that learning new information affects how we evaluate past events, making us unable to separate our current knowledge from our assessment of what we previously thought was likely. The answer captures the core mechanism of hindsight bias - that newly acquired information inevitably influences our reconstruction of past judgments, making outcomes seem more predictable in retrospect than they actually were.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing involves selecting the optimal option, while satisficing means choosing an option that meets your satisfaction. Individuals with high levels of neuroticism are more prone to use the maximizing approach.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as selecting the optimal option, which aligns with the answer key's definition of trying to make the best choice.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

You might present the idea of actively responding to questions throughout the lecture. By making it standard practice for students to answer questions you pose—such as by providing them with a microphone—they will feel compelled to respond. According to expected utility theory, students would face a higher cost of being unprepared, as this could lead to stress and embarrassment if they answer incorrectly. This approach can motivate students to participate more actively with the lecture content.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement with the question by proposing a specific teaching strategy (active questioning with microphones), connecting it to relevant theory (expected utility theory), and explaining the psychological mechanism (cost of being unprepared leading to motivation). The answer shows thoughtful consideration of how to encourage student engagement within resource constraints.
