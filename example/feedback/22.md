Grade: 5.5

## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

The social-intuitionist model identifies System 1 as moral intuition and System 2 as moral reasoning, with System 1 playing the more influential role.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies System 1 as moral intuition, which aligns with the answer key's description of System 1 as intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies System 2 as moral reasoning, which matches the answer key's description of System 2 as reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student correctly states that System 1 plays the more influential role, which aligns with the answer key's point that System 1 is more dominant than System 2.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

Relatedness refers to assessing how likely it is that something or someone fits into a category based on how well they match our mental representation of that category.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the heuristic as 'relatedness' instead of the representativeness heuristic.
- Correct: The student correctly explains the underlying mechanism - estimating likelihood of category membership based on how well someone matches our mental representation/stereotype of that category.

Score: 0.5

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring involves relying on the initial information when making future choices, while the primacy effect refers to the tendency for the earliest information received to have the greatest influence. Both concepts relate to the sequence in which information is introduced.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as relying on initial information when making decisions, which aligns with the answer key's definition of taking the first piece of information as the starting point.
- Incorrect: The student describes the primacy effect as early information having the greatest influence, but the answer key specifically refers to better remembering the first piece of information, which is about memory rather than influence.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both concepts relate to the sequence of information introduction, which captures the essence of overreliance on first information mentioned in the answer key.

Score: 0.6666666666666666

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion involves a stronger tendency to avoid losses, while risk aversion is the general avoidance of taking risks.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves a stronger tendency to avoid losses, which captures the core concept that losses are weighted more heavily than gains.
- Correct: The student correctly describes risk aversion as the general avoidance of taking risks, which effectively captures the preference for certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 1.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias refers to the tendency for initial impressions to have a stronger influence than more recent experiences. This can make individuals reluctant to end an unhappy relationship, as they continue to view their partner based on their original perception.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly defines impact bias as being about initial impressions vs. recent experiences, when it actually refers to overestimating the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Incorrect: The student's explanation of how impact bias prevents breakups is based on their incorrect definition about initial impressions, rather than the correct mechanism of overestimating how bad a breakup will make them feel.

Score: 0.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves estimating the emotional impact of future events. This is crucial in end-of-life choices because individuals often overestimate how intensely they will feel about future circumstances. As a result, someone who anticipates wanting to end their life if they develop a debilitating illness might not actually feel that way when the time comes, and if they become incapacitated, they may no longer be able to express a change in their wishes.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines affective forecasting as estimating/predicting the emotional impact of future events, which aligns with the answer key's definition of predictions about future emotional state.
- Correct: The student accurately explains the key point about healthy people predicting they would want to die when sick, but then not actually preferring to die when they become ill, demonstrating understanding of the discrepancy between predicted and actual preferences.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

People tend to overestimate events with low probabilities. Additionally, perceptions vary since extremely low probabilities, such as 0.01%, are often seen as impossible.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people overestimate low probabilities, which aligns with the answer key's point about merely low probabilities being overestimated.
- Correct: The student accurately states that extremely low probabilities like 0.01% are often seen as impossible, which matches the answer key's second point about extremely low probabilities being interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

In prospect theory, loss aversion means that individuals perceive outcomes as gains or losses, and they tend to give more emphasis to losses than to gains.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion means giving more emphasis/weight to losses than to gains, which captures the core concept that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected utility builds on the concept of expected value by including extra elements. The key distinctions are that utility theory integrates normative values and accounts for biases and heuristics.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions 'normative values' but doesn't clearly distinguish that expected value theory deals only with financial values while expected utility theory deals with non-financial values as well.
- Incorrect: The student states that utility theory 'accounts for biases and heuristics' but the answer key specifies that expected value theory does NOT consider heuristics and biases, while expected utility theory considers risk aversion specifically.

Score: 0.0

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

The expected value theory model focuses on the financial components of decisions when making choices. The expected utility theory model expands on this by incorporating a utility value that accounts for social factors. The multi-faceted model further develops the utility model by taking into account various dimensions of different outcomes. The prospect theory model suggests that individuals perceive decisions in terms of gains and losses, and it includes heuristics and biases in its framework.

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies expected value theory as focusing on financial outcomes, though they don't mention probabilities which is a key component.
- Incorrect: Student mentions utility expansion but incorrectly specifies 'social factors' rather than subjective utility in general, and doesn't clearly distinguish it from expected value theory.
- Incorrect: Student refers to 'multi-faceted model' instead of 'multi-attribute utility theory' and mentions various dimensions but misses key concepts of multiple attributes, weights, and the normative nature.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies prospect theory as involving gains/losses perception and including heuristics and biases, capturing the descriptive/behavioral nature.

Score: 0.5

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Loss aversion causes individuals to fear losses more strongly than they value equivalent gains.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly defines loss aversion but fails to address how it affects risk aversion. The answer key requires explaining that loss aversion can make people risk-seeking to avoid losses, but the student only states the basic definition without connecting it to changes in risk preferences.

Score: 0.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves learning behaviors by forming associations. Classical conditioning is the process of understanding that stimulus A is connected to stimulus B. Operant conditioning involves learning that a specific behavior results in a particular stimulus, such as behavior A causing stimulus A and behavior B causing stimulus B.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that conditioning involves learning through forming associations, which aligns with the answer key's definition of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as understanding connections between stimuli (stimulus A connected to stimulus B), which matches the answer key's explanation of learning to associate things that happen together.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning that specific behaviors result in particular stimuli/outcomes, which corresponds to the answer key's description of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation involves believing that A causes B, while illusory correlation refers to perceiving a connection between A and B without a cause-and-effect relationship.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly identifies that illusory causation involves believing A causes B, but incorrectly defines illusory correlation as perceiving a connection without cause-and-effect. The key distinction is that illusory correlation occurs when no actual correlation exists between variables, not when correlation exists without causation.

Score: 0.0

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

Knowing how the Dutch healthcare system functions is an example of a schema, while knowing the appropriate behavior at a birthday party is an example of a script. This is because a script provides instructions for a typical social event, and a birthday party is a typical social event.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that understanding the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, though they don't explicitly explain why (it represents knowledge and relationships between concepts).
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that knowing appropriate behavior at a birthday party is a script and provides a valid explanation that scripts provide instructions for typical social events.

Score: 1.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

Physical stance focuses on the observable behavior elicited by specific stimuli, without considering intentions or thoughts.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the physical stance and provides an accurate explanation that aligns with behaviorist principles - focusing on observable behavior from stimuli while explicitly excluding mental processes like intentions or thoughts, which matches the behaviorist rejection of studying the unmeasurable mind.

Score: 1.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

Intentional stance involves considering the thoughts and intentions that drive a person's behavior.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the intentional stance instead of the design stance. While the intentional stance does involve considering thoughts and intentions, evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance because they analyze psychological processes in terms of their adaptive function and purpose, not in terms of beliefs and desires.

Score: 0.0

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Sequential means B happens after A. Continuous means B always follows A. Probable means B may occur after A. Contiguous means A and B happen simultaneously in the same place. Likeness means A and B appear similar on the surface.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: Student mentions 'Sequential' but this doesn't match 'Distinctness/Specificity' which requires that B follows A but not other events - the key distinction is specificity, not just temporal order.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies 'Continuous' as B always following A, which matches the consistency heuristic from the answer key.
- Incorrect: Student describes 'Probable' as B may occur after A, but plausibility refers to common sense making the causal relationship believable, not probability of occurrence.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies 'Contiguous' as A and B happening simultaneously in the same place, matching the contiguity in time and space heuristic.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies 'Likeness' as A and B appearing similar on the surface, which matches the similarity in cause and effect heuristic.

Score: 0.6

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Negativity bias causes individuals to focus more on emotional content, leading them to encounter more outrages on social media. Meanwhile, availability heuristic bias makes people estimate the frequency or likelihood of events based on how readily examples come to mind. Together, these biases result in seeing more outrages due to negativity bias, making them easier to recall and causing an inflated perception of how many people are genuinely morally upset.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias and explains that it causes people to focus more on negative/emotional content, which aligns with the answer key's description of seeking out or placing more weight on negative information like morally outraged content.
- Correct: The student accurately defines availability heuristic as estimating frequency or likelihood based on how readily examples come to mind, which matches the answer key's definition exactly.
- Correct: The student successfully explains the interaction between the two biases - negativity bias causes exposure to more outrage content, which through availability heuristic leads to overestimating moral outrage frequency. This demonstrates understanding of how the biases work together as described in the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

Your understanding of certain subjects is influenced by the perspective of someone you strongly dislike.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student answer discusses influence of perspective rather than addressing magical contagion as misapplication of biological domain concepts (like contamination/infection) to social/psychological domains where physical contact properties don't actually transfer.

Score: 0.0

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

The severity of the theory and society's perception of it play a role; if it is not a serious conspiracy theory, it tends to be more socially accepted and is less likely to be viewed as delusional.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions society's perception but misses the key criteria from the answer key: that a conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief AND not commonly accepted. The student focuses on severity and social acceptance but doesn't identify the irrationality component as a distinguishing factor.

Score: 0.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

Their level of education, their wealth, and the degree to which they feel isolated.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: Level of education is not listed among the cognitive and personality factors in the answer key. The key mentions low intelligence and low analytical thinking, but not education level specifically.
- Incorrect: Wealth is not mentioned as one of the cognitive and personality factors contributing to conspiratorial thinking in the answer key.
- Incorrect: Feeling isolated is not listed among the cognitive and personality factors in the answer key, which focuses on factors like pattern recognition, paranormal beliefs, and narcissism.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Priority

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student answer 'Priority' does not address the psychological mechanism by which incorrect answers interfere with learning. The answer key requires explanation of source amnesia, proactive interference, or the continued-influence effect, none of which are mentioned or implied in this single-word response.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

The psychological process where increased exposure to something leads to a greater preference for it.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the core psychological mechanism - that increased exposure leads to greater preference. This directly describes the mere exposure effect, which is the key concept from the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Negative.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student only provided 'Negative' which is too vague and incomplete. While this could be interpreted as 'No' (correct direction), the answer lacks the crucial explanation that people with major depressive disorder are actually MORE accurate due to reduced optimism bias, not less accurate.

Score: 0.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

When sensory information becomes less reliable, prior beliefs have a greater impact on perception.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when sensory information becomes less reliable, prior beliefs have a greater impact on perception, which directly matches the key concept from the answer key.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

Prenormative involves focusing primarily on personal benefits. Normative centers on considering how others might view you. Postnormative emphasizes evaluating the best choices based on their usefulness.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the pre-conventional level as focusing on personal benefits, which aligns with avoiding punishment and gaining rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as considering how others view you, which matches the focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Incorrect: The student describes post-conventional level as evaluating choices based on usefulness, which doesn't capture the focus on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model of past events examines the factors that contributed to a decision's result. This approach reinforces outcome bias, which subsequently contributes to hindsight bias.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes a causal model as examining factors that contributed to a decision's result, but misses the key concept that it's a coherent narrative showing how past events are related.
- Incorrect: The student mentions outcome bias rather than the correct mechanism - that events in a causal model seem more inevitable than they actually were, which is what contributes to hindsight bias.

Score: 0.0

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

When reflecting on past choices, we inevitably incorporate new information, which reinforces hindsight bias by making the results appear more predictable.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that newly learned information is inevitably incorporated when reflecting on past judgments, and explains how this reinforces hindsight bias by making outcomes seem more predictable than they actually were at the time.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing as a decision-making style involves striving to choose the best possible option with the highest value. In contrast, satisficing is about making a decision that is good enough to bring satisfaction. (The practice exam suggests that neuroticism is associated with maximizing, but the Heymans bot claims neuroticism relates to satisficing since it involves avoiding negative emotions.) Personally, I think neuroticism is connected to maximizing.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as striving to choose the best possible option with the highest value, which aligns with the answer key's definition of 'trying to make the best choice.'
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as making a decision that is good enough to bring satisfaction, which matches the answer key's definition of 'making a good-enough choice.'
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that neuroticism is connected to maximizing, despite acknowledging conflicting information from different sources, which matches the answer key's expected response.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

From what I’ve learned in this course, I would present the information so that actively engaging with the material feels ethically positive, leveraging moral intuition, and gently making active participation the default choice, using a subtle nudge to encourage the desired behavior of fully engaging with the content.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement by applying specific concepts from the course (moral intuition, nudging, default choices) to address the practical challenge of encouraging student engagement within resource constraints. The answer shows thoughtful consideration of how behavioral insights can be applied to educational settings.
