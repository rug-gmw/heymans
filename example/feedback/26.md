## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

System 1 thinking in moral reasoning is quicker, unconscious, and relies on intuition when forming moral judgments, while system 2 thinking is slower, more intentional, and logical in its approach. According to this model, system 1 is the more prevalent mode.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 thinking relies on intuition in moral reasoning, which matches the answer key requirement.
- Correct: The student accurately describes System 2 thinking as logical and intentional, which aligns with the answer key's description of reasoning/rational thought.
- Correct: The student correctly states that System 1 is more prevalent, which matches the answer key's requirement that System 1 is more dominant than System 2.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

Availability heuristic refers to the tendency of people to form judgments using information that is readily accessible to them from their previous experiences and knowledge.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the heuristic as the availability heuristic instead of the representativeness heuristic, which is the correct answer according to the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student's explanation describes the availability heuristic (using readily accessible information from memory) rather than the representativeness heuristic (estimating likelihood based on similarity to stereotypes), which does not match the required explanation.

Score: 0.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring refers to the concept that the initial information someone obtains about a person or thing has the strongest influence on their overall impression, with later information adding to but having less impact on that initial judgment, making it difficult to change one's opinion once the anchor is set. The primacy effect is related, as it involves the tendency for the first details heard or seen about an event or individual to shape subsequent evaluations. Both concepts are connected through their role in forming impressions, particularly at the beginning of the process.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as relating to initial information having the strongest influence and being difficult to change, which aligns with the concept of taking the first piece of information as a starting point.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as the tendency for first details to shape subsequent evaluations, which corresponds to better remembering the first piece of information.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both concepts share a connection through their role in forming impressions at the beginning of the process, which demonstrates understanding of the overreliance on first information.

Score: 1.0

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion is the tendency for individuals to base their choices on the desire to prevent losses, while risk aversion is the tendency to steer clear of decisions or situations that involve potential danger or uncertainty.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves basing choices on preventing/avoiding losses, which aligns with the key concept that losses are weighed more heavily than gains.
- Correct: The student accurately describes risk aversion as the tendency to avoid uncertainty and potential danger, which matches the answer key's definition of preferring certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 1.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias refers to the tendency for individuals to exaggerate the effect a decision will have on their future emotions. This can cause people to stay in unhappy relationships because they believe they will feel much lonelier and sadder than they actually would after ending it.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as the tendency to exaggerate the effect of future events (decisions) on future emotions, which matches the answer key's definition of overestimating the impact of future events on future feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly explains how impact bias prevents breakups by stating people believe they will feel much worse (lonelier and sadder) than they actually would, which aligns with the answer key's point about overestimating how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves anticipating how one might feel in the future after making a decision. This concept is particularly relevant in end-of-life choices, since such decisions are irreversible. It can help assess whether an individual truly feels prepared to proceed with ending their life.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies affective forecasting as predicting future emotional states, though they phrase it as 'anticipating how one might feel in the future after making a decision' rather than the more precise definition of predictions about future emotional state.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention the key insight that healthy people may predict they'd prefer to die when sick, but actually may not prefer to die when they become sick. Instead, they focus on the irreversibility of decisions and assessing preparedness.

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

People tend to overestimate small probabilities, and this tendency is consistent across all low probability events.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people overestimate small probabilities, which aligns with the answer key's point about merely low probabilities being overestimated.
- Incorrect: The student states the tendency is 'consistent across all low probability events,' which contradicts the answer key's distinction that extremely low probabilities are often treated as impossibilities rather than being overestimated.

Score: 0.5

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion represents a tendency to value losses more intensely than equivalent gains.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion means losses are valued more intensely than equivalent gains, which directly corresponds to the answer key's point that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory focuses solely on financial results, while expected utility theory considers both financial outcomes and additional factors by evaluating utility using probabilities and weights. Expected value theory is more statistical and limited in scope, whereas expected utility theory is more subjective and comprehensive.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory focuses on financial results while expected utility theory considers additional factors beyond just financial outcomes, which aligns with the answer key's distinction between financial and non-financial values.
- Incorrect: The student mentions that expected utility theory is more subjective and comprehensive but does not specifically address the key distinction about risk aversion or heuristics and biases that differentiate the two theories as stated in the answer key.

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Loss aversion influences how much people avoid risk because they strongly prefer to prevent losses. When faced with a scenario involving potential loss, individuals might take on more risk in an effort to recover what is at stake.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion can lead people to take on more risk when trying to avoid or recover from potential losses, which aligns with the key point that loss aversion decreases risk aversion and can make people risk seeking in loss domains.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning is a type of associative learning involving two stimuli. Classical conditioning involves learning by linking a behavior to a conditioned stimulus, while operant conditioning involves learning behavior through the connection with rewards.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as associative learning, which aligns with learning associations through covariation from the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student describes classical conditioning as linking behavior to a conditioned stimulus, but the answer key emphasizes learning associations between two things that happen together in time and space, not behavior linkage.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that operant conditioning involves learning behavior through connection with rewards, which matches the answer key's point about actions causing rewards or punishments.

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation refers to when a person believes that a specific cause leads to an event, while illusory correlation involves a person perceiving a connection or relationship between a cause and an event that may not actually exist.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student confuses the concepts by describing illusory causation as believing a cause leads to an event (which is just regular causation thinking) rather than incorrectly interpreting correlation as causation. For illusory correlation, they correctly identify perceiving non-existent relationships but incorrectly frame it in terms of cause-and-effect rather than correlation between variables.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

Knowing how to act appropriately at a birthday party is considered a script because it represents the typical sequence of behaviors expected in that situation. On the other hand, understanding the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, as it serves as a mental structure that organizes overall knowledge about what that system entails or consists of.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that understanding the Dutch healthcare system is a schema and provides an appropriate explanation that it serves as a mental structure organizing knowledge about the system, which aligns with the answer key's description of schemas as knowledge and relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script and explains it as representing typical sequence of behaviors expected in that situation, which matches the answer key's description of scripts as social schemas describing behavior in specific situations.

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

The observer stance was adopted because they decided to study how stimuli provoke behavior as a means to understand the mind, rather than attempting other methods of measuring the mind that proved ineffective.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the 'observer stance' (which is not one of Dennett's three stances) instead of the physical stance. While they correctly understand that behaviorists focused on stimulus-behavior relationships, they mischaracterize this as studying these relationships 'as a means to understand the mind' when behaviorists actually rejected studying the mind entirely and focused purely on observable physical processes.

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

Survival stance, as the idea of ingroup favoritism was formed to build a community that supports relationships for reproduction and mutual care, while also defending the group against possible external threats.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the 'survival stance' rather than the design stance. While they correctly understand that evolutionary psychology examines functions like community building and defense, they misidentify Dennett's levels of analysis. The design stance is about understanding systems in terms of their intended function or purpose, which is exactly what evolutionary psychologists do when they analyze psychological processes for their adaptive value.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Distinctiveness heuristic - Is A exclusively linked to or responsible for B? Consistency heuristic - Does A consistently link to or cause B? Plausibility heuristic - Does A relate to or lead to other occurrences? Contiguity heuristic - Would A still be connected to B under different circumstances? Similarity heuristic - Do others also observe a connection or causal relationship between A and B?

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies distinctiveness heuristic and captures the core concept that A should be exclusively linked to B, which aligns with the answer key's concept of specificity.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies consistency heuristic and accurately describes that A should consistently link to or cause B, matching the answer key.
- Incorrect: Student's explanation of plausibility heuristic is incorrect. They describe it as 'Does A relate to or lead to other occurrences?' which doesn't match the answer key's definition about common sense plausibility of A causing B.
- Incorrect: Student's explanation of contiguity heuristic is incorrect. They describe it as 'Would A still be connected to B under different circumstances?' which doesn't match the answer key's definition about temporal and spatial proximity.
- Incorrect: Student's explanation of similarity heuristic is incorrect. They describe it as whether others observe the connection, which doesn't match the answer key's definition about superficial resemblance between A and B.

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Representative bias and confirmation bias both play a role in this. Confirmation bias causes us to encounter on social media mainly the content that matches our existing beliefs, so if we think people are more morally outraged than they truly are, we tend to seek out information that supports this view while ignoring contradictory evidence. This interacts with representative bias, where we overestimate the frequency of moral outrage because we compare it to a memorable extreme event. Together, these biases amplify the perception that moral outrage is more widespread than it actually is.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student identifies confirmation bias instead of negativity bias. While confirmation bias can play a role, the answer key specifically requires negativity bias - the tendency to seek out or place more weight on negative information like morally outraged content.
- Incorrect: The student mentions 'representative bias' instead of the availability heuristic. While these concepts are related, the answer key specifically requires the availability heuristic - estimating frequency based on ease of recall, not representativeness comparisons to memorable events.
- Correct: The student correctly explains how the two biases work together to cause overestimation of moral outrage frequency. They show understanding that one bias affects what content we encounter, which then influences our frequency judgments through the second bias.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

Magical contagion, as a concept in fields like psychology, suggests that people avoid wearing items, such as a sweater, if they previously belonged to someone they dislike due to a negative mental connection with that person or object. In biology, the magical contagion effect manifests as the body's instinct to shield itself from potential harm or illness. However, despite this aversion, there is no logical reason to believe that wearing a sweater owned by someone you intensely dislike would actually cause you harm or sickness.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that biological contagion concepts (avoiding harm/illness) are being inappropriately applied to social/psychological situations (avoiding items from disliked people), and notes there's no logical reason for actual harm, demonstrating understanding of the cross-domain misapplication.

Score: 1.0

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A delusional conspiracy theory is one that is impossible, while a non-delusional conspiracy theory is one that could potentially be true.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student focuses on possibility/impossibility rather than the key criteria from the answer key: irrationality combined with lack of common acceptance. The answer key defines delusional conspiracy theories as those that are both irrational beliefs AND not commonly accepted, which is different from simply being impossible versus possible.

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

Emotional instability, nervousness, illogical thinking

Feedback:

- Incorrect: Emotional instability is not listed among the specific cognitive and personality factors from the answer key that contribute to conspiratorial thinking.
- Incorrect: Nervousness is not mentioned in the answer key as one of the factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking discussed in the lecture.
- Correct: Illogical thinking aligns with 'having a low level of analytical thinking' from the answer key, as both refer to deficiencies in rational thought processes.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

initial impression advantage

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student answered 'initial impression advantage' which is not related to the psychological mechanisms described in the answer key. The correct mechanisms are source amnesia, proactive interference, or the continued-influence effect, which all relate to how incorrect initial answers can interfere with learning the correct information.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

They believe that by using the repetition theory, their message will appear more appealing.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions 'repetition theory' but does not identify the specific psychological mechanism of mere exposure effect or illusory-truth effect. The answer is too vague and doesn't demonstrate understanding of the underlying psychological principle.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Yes. Individuals with depression tend to exaggerate the chances of negative events occurring to them.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that people with depression are less accurate because they exaggerate negative event probabilities. The correct answer is that people with depression are MORE accurate at predictions because they show reduced optimism bias, not increased pessimism.

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

When sensory information becomes less reliable, prior beliefs can be affected by biases like representativeness bias or confirmation bias, resulting in a distorted and biased perception that ultimately leads to suboptimal decision making.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly describes what happens to prior beliefs themselves (becoming biased) rather than explaining that prior beliefs have increased influence on perception when sensory information is unreliable. The answer misses the key concept that unreliable sensory input leads to greater reliance on expectations/priors in forming perceptions.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

The pre-conventional level includes stages 1 and 2, focusing on how individuals, often young children, make moral decisions based on the possibility of rewards or punishments. The conventional level, comprising stages 3 and 4, involves making moral judgments by striving to be seen as good people and following societal rules and expectations. The post-conventional level, which covers stages 5 and 6, reflects a more advanced and universal ethical understanding, where people base their moral decisions on broader ethical principles.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the pre-conventional level as focusing on rewards and punishments, which matches the answer key's description of obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as involving following societal rules and expectations and striving to be seen as good people, which aligns with the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the post-conventional level as based on broader ethical principles and universal ethical understanding, which matches the answer key's description of focus on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model is a mental framework a person forms after an event, explaining what caused it. This model plays a role in hindsight bias because once someone knows the outcome, their understanding of the cause is shaped by that knowledge. It also reinforces the tendency to believe they predicted the event all along, even if they did not at the moment the decision was made.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies a causal model as a mental framework that explains what caused past events, which aligns with the answer key's definition of a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student explains that causal models contribute to hindsight bias by making people believe they predicted events all along, which captures the essence that events seem more inevitable than they were, though expressed somewhat differently than the answer key.

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Learning plays a role in hindsight bias because new information is always considered when reflecting on a past decision, which affects hindsight bias since you now have knowledge that was unavailable at the time the decision occurred.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that newly learned information cannot be avoided when reflecting on past judgments, which is the core mechanism of how learning contributes to hindsight bias. The answer demonstrates understanding that knowledge acquired after an event influences our retrospective assessment of what we thought we knew before.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing decision style refers to the tendency of individuals to make choices aimed at achieving the best and most optimal result. In contrast, satisficing describes the tendency to make decisions that result in outcomes that are simply adequate or "good enough." Someone who scores high in neuroticism is more likely to use the maximizing decision-making approach.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as making choices aimed at achieving the best and most optimal result, which aligns with the answer key's definition of 'trying to make the best choice.'
- Correct: The student accurately defines satisficing as making decisions that result in outcomes that are adequate or 'good enough,' which matches the answer key's definition of 'making a good-enough choice.'
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that someone high in neuroticism is more likely to use the maximizing decision-making approach, which directly matches the answer key.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

One possible method could involve holding lectures while using a playful ball-shaped device with a built-in microphone that the lecturer can easily toss or pass to students, encouraging them to participate spontaneously. These students are more likely to engage because they know their peers are watching and listening. When a lecturer asks a large group a question, typically no one feels compelled to respond, similar to the example shared in class about a crowded concert hall. In large groups, individuals tend to feel less accountable for their behavior and are heavily influenced by those around them. Returning to the microphone ball, if one person feels encouraged to answer, others are likely to follow, feeling more comfortable responding to subsequent questions. The lecturer can also rely on students’ existing mental frameworks, schemas, and classroom routines, trusting that they understand when to listen and engage. Taking notes, which is also part of classroom behavior, represents another form of engagement. If the lecturer observes students taking notes, it indicates he is effectively doing his job.
