## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

This model suggests that our moral judgments originate from system 1, the intuitive process. We then use system 2 to logically justify the moral decisions initially made by system 1. In this framework, system 1 holds the primary influence.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 refers to the intuitive process, which aligns with the answer key's requirement to identify System 1 as intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student implicitly identifies System 2 as the logical justification process, which corresponds to reasoning/rational thought as specified in the answer key.
- Correct: The student clearly states that 'system 1 holds the primary influence,' directly answering that System 1 is more dominant than System 2.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

The representativeness heuristic involves judging that something belongs to a category because it closely matches typical examples of that category.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process in this scenario.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that the representativeness heuristic involves judging category membership based on similarity to typical examples, which captures the essence of estimating likelihood based on resemblance to stereotypes.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring involves relying on initial information to create an impression and then incorporating new information afterward. The primacy effect refers to the tendency of people to better remember the information they encounter first. Both concepts share the idea of using the earliest information to shape an impression.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as relying on initial information as a starting point, though they phrase it as 'creating an impression' rather than explicitly stating it's used as a starting point.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as the tendency to better remember information encountered first, which matches the answer key exactly.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both concepts involve using the earliest information to shape impressions, which captures the essence of overreliance on first information from the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency to perceive losses as more significant than gains, while risk aversion is the general preference to steer clear of risky situations.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves perceiving losses as more significant than gains, which matches the answer key's description of weighing losses more heavily than gains.
- Correct: The student correctly describes risk aversion as a preference to avoid risky situations, which aligns with the answer key's definition of preferring certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 1.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias refers to the tendency to overestimate the intensity and duration of our emotional reactions to future events. This bias might stop individuals from ending relationships because they assume they will feel worse after a breakup than they actually will.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as overestimating emotional reactions to future events, which captures the essence of overestimating the impact of future events on our feelings. The mention of both intensity and duration adds appropriate detail.
- Correct: The student correctly explains that impact bias prevents breakups because people assume they will feel worse than they actually will, which aligns with the answer key's point about overestimating how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting refers to the predictions we make about how we will feel in the future. This is significant because it can lead to discrepancies between our emotions when making end-of-life choices while healthy and how we actually feel when facing those decisions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines affective forecasting as predictions about future emotional states, which matches the answer key's definition of 'predictions about our own future emotional state.'
- Correct: The student accurately captures the importance of affective forecasting in end-of-life decisions by noting the discrepancy between emotions when healthy versus when actually facing those decisions, which aligns with the answer key's point about healthy people predicting they'd prefer to die when sick but potentially feeling differently when actually sick.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

People tend to both overestimate and underestimate low probabilities. Specifically, they overestimate probabilities that are low but not extremely so, while they underestimate extremely low probabilities by considering them impossible.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that merely low probabilities (like 10%) are overestimated, which aligns with the answer key's first point.
- Correct: The student accurately states that extremely low probabilities are underestimated by being considered impossible, which matches the answer key's second point about them being interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion means that experiencing a loss impacts us more strongly than gaining an equivalent amount, resulting in a greater negative effect.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that losses have a greater impact than equivalent gains, which captures the core concept that negative utilities are weighted more heavily than positive utilities in prospect theory.

Score: 1.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory focuses solely on monetary outcomes, whereas expected utility theory takes into account both financial and non-financial results. Additionally, expected utility theory incorporates heuristics and biases, which are not addressed by expected value theory.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory focuses on monetary/financial outcomes while expected utility theory considers both financial and non-financial results, which matches the first point in the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that expected utility theory incorporates heuristics and biases, when the answer key indicates that expected utility theory considers risk aversion, not heuristics and biases (which are actually outside the scope of traditional expected utility theory).

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected value theory accounts for decisions involving financial outcomes by evaluating the value of each option. Expected utility theory extends this approach to include non-financial outcomes by assessing the utility of each option. Multiple attribute utility theory recognizes that each option comprises several attributes, each with its own utility and importance. Prospect theory is a descriptive model of decision-making, value, and utility that incorporates heuristics and biases.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as dealing with financial outcomes and mentions evaluating the value of each option, capturing the core concept.
- Correct: The student accurately describes expected utility theory as extending expected value theory to include non-financial outcomes through utility assessment.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that multi-attribute utility theory involves options with multiple attributes, each having utility and importance (weight), matching the key concepts.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies prospect theory as a descriptive model that incorporates heuristics and biases, capturing its behavioral nature.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Loss aversion causes people to be more cautious when facing risks.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that loss aversion makes people more cautious/risk averse. The answer key indicates that loss aversion actually decreases risk aversion and can make people risk-seeking when trying to avoid losses.

Score: 0.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves learning the relationship between two events that occur together. The key distinction is that classical conditioning teaches the association between two stimuli, while operant conditioning involves learning cause and effect through behaviors followed by rewards or punishments.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as learning relationships/associations between events that occur together, which aligns with the answer key's definition of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as learning associations between two stimuli, which matches the answer key's explanation of learning to associate things that happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning cause and effect through behaviors followed by rewards or punishments, which directly corresponds to the answer key's definition of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory correlation occurs when people believe there is a connection between two things even though none exists, while illusory causation happens when a real correlation is mistaken for a cause-and-effect relationship.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that illusory correlation involves perceiving a connection/correlation where none exists, and illusory causation involves mistaking a real correlation for causation. This matches the answer key's distinction between perceiving non-existent correlations versus incorrectly interpreting existing correlations as causal.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

Comprehending the Dutch healthcare system is considered a schema because it requires understanding a collection of concepts. Knowing the appropriate behavior at a birthday party is a script since it pertains to a particular social and cultural context.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the Dutch healthcare system as a schema and provides an appropriate explanation that it involves understanding a collection of concepts, which aligns with the answer key's emphasis on knowledge and relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies birthday party behavior as a script and explains it pertains to a particular social and cultural context, which matches the answer key's description of a social schema for specific situational behavior.

Score: 1.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

A mechanical perspective focused solely on observable behavior and its triggers, without considering the underlying intentions behind the actions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that behaviorists adopted a mechanical/physical stance by focusing on observable behavior and stimulus-response relationships without considering internal mental states or intentions, which aligns with the physical stance's emphasis on causal processes rather than beliefs or desires.

Score: 1.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

Evolutionary psychologists take the mechanical stance because they aim to understand the functioning of psychological processes.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the mechanical stance instead of the design stance. While they correctly recognize that evolutionary psychologists focus on functioning, the mechanical stance concerns how something works mechanistically, whereas the design stance (correct answer) concerns what something is designed to do or its purpose/function in evolutionary terms.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Specific: A directly causes B, not C causing B. Consistent: A invariably leads to B. Plausible: Given what I know, A can cause B, so A causes B. Contiguous in space and time: A causes B, and it must be A and B occurring together, not other events. Similar in cause and effect: A causes B because B follows A.

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies distinctness/specificity - that A causes B when B follows A but not other events (C). The concept is understood despite brief phrasing.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies consistency - that A invariably/always leads to B. The core concept is captured accurately.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies plausibility - using prior knowledge to judge if A can reasonably cause B. The explanation captures the common sense aspect.
- Incorrect: Student misunderstands contiguity. They describe it as 'A and B occurring together, not other events' rather than A and B occurring at the same time and place.
- Incorrect: Student misunderstands similarity. They describe it as 'B follows A' rather than A and B superficially resembling each other in appearance or nature.

Score: 0.6

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Availability bias refers to the tendency to judge how likely something is based on how easily we can recall examples. Negativity bias leads us to focus on negative emotional material. These biases can combine, causing us to look for morally outraged content on social media (negativity bias), which in turn makes such examples more memorable and leads us to overestimate how common morally outraged people are (availability bias).

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias and explains it as the tendency to focus on negative emotional material, which aligns with the answer key's description of seeking out or placing more weight on negative information like morally outraged content.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies availability bias (termed as availability heuristic in the answer key) and accurately explains it as judging likelihood based on how easily examples can be recalled, which matches the answer key's definition of estimating frequency based on ease of recall.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of how the two biases interact, explaining that negativity bias causes us to seek morally outraged content, which makes such examples more memorable and leads to overestimation through availability bias, matching the causal relationship described in the answer key.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

The 'incorrect' frame is applied in these situations because the other person is regarded as if they were contagious like bacteria, despite not actually being so. As a result, the field of knowledge related to bacteria is used to evaluate people.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that biological contagion concepts (bacteria being contagious) are inappropriately applied to social/interpersonal situations, demonstrating understanding that framework theories from one domain (biological) are being misapplied to another domain (social).

Score: 1.0

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A non-delusional conspiracy theory may be widely accepted, whereas a delusional conspiracy theory is not.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student only identifies one criterion (lack of common acceptance for delusional theories) but misses the key distinction about irrationality. The answer key requires both irrationality AND lack of common acceptance to distinguish delusional from non-delusional conspiracy theories.

Score: 0.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

Inclination to perceive patterns that do not exist, a belief in the supernatural, and attributing independence to things that are not autonomous.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'inclination to perceive patterns that do not exist' which matches 'seeing patterns in randomness' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student mentions 'belief in the supernatural' which corresponds to 'believing paranormal phenomena' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student describes 'attributing independence to things that are not autonomous' which aligns with 'attributing agency where it does not exist' from the answer key.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

The availability heuristic refers to the tendency to judge the likelihood or frequency of an event based on how easily examples come to mind.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student provided a definition of the availability heuristic, which is unrelated to the question about how incorrect answers during self-quizzing can interfere with learning. The answer key requires discussion of source amnesia, proactive interference, or the continued-influence effect, none of which were mentioned.

Score: 0.0

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

Heuristic based on familiarity

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that the mechanism is based on familiarity, which directly corresponds to the mere exposure effect described in the answer key - the tendency to prefer things we are familiar with through repeated exposure.

Score: 1.0

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

No, they might actually be more accurate because they exhibit less positivity bias compared to psychologically healthy individuals.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people with major depressive disorder are more accurate at predictions and accurately explains this is due to reduced positivity/optimism bias compared to healthy individuals. The core concept matches the answer key despite slightly different terminology.

Score: 1.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

The impact of existing beliefs on perception becomes stronger.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that prior beliefs have a stronger influence on perception when sensory information becomes less reliable, which matches the key concept from the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

Pre-conventional thinking centers on personal interests when determining what is right. Conventional thinking involves considering the perspectives of others in making moral judgments. Post-conventional thinking goes deeper, reflecting on broader principles of what ought to be done and how society views what is right.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes pre-conventional level as focusing on personal interests, which aligns with the answer key's description of avoiding punishment or gaining rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes conventional level as considering others' perspectives in moral judgments, which matches the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Incorrect: The student describes post-conventional thinking as reflecting on 'how society views what is right,' which contradicts the answer key's emphasis on abstract principles and values that transcend societal norms.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model explains that one event occurred as a result of another. It plays a role in hindsight bias because once the outcome is known, we create a causal explanation that makes it harder to remember what we originally predicted, since the causal model is easier to recall.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a causal model explains how events are related through cause-and-effect relationships, which aligns with the answer key's description of a coherent narrative of related past events.
- Incorrect: While the student mentions that causal models affect memory and recall, they don't address the key mechanism that events seem more inevitable than they actually were, which is the core contribution to hindsight bias according to the answer key.

Score: 0.5

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

People often struggle to ignore newly acquired information (the actual outcome) when recalling their initial expectations about the outcome before it was revealed.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people cannot ignore newly acquired information when recalling past judgments, which directly matches the answer key's main point about being unable to avoid taking newly learned information into account when estimating past likelihood judgments.

Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing involves seeking the optimal choice, while satisficing means settling for a decision that is adequate. Individuals with high levels of neuroticism are more inclined to engage in maximizing.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as seeking the optimal choice, which aligns with 'trying to make the best choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as settling for a decision that is adequate, which matches 'making a good-enough choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that individuals with high neuroticism are more inclined to engage in maximizing, which matches the answer key's expectation.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

By repeatedly mentioning the material during lectures and referring to the textbook, students become more acquainted with it, which can increase their interest and motivation to participate.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement by proposing a concrete strategy (repeated exposure and references) with clear reasoning about how it would increase student engagement through familiarity and motivation. While brief, the answer shows thoughtful consideration of the pedagogical challenge presented.
