## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidtâ€™s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

System 1 relies on emotional responses to make moral judgments, where actions are taken because they feel right or avoided because they feel wrong, essentially guided by intuition. In contrast, System 2 involves a conscious, careful assessment of whether an action is morally right or wrong, relying on deliberate rational thought. According to this model, System 1 tends to be more influential.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 relies on emotional responses and intuition in moral judgment, which aligns with the answer key's requirement that System 1 refers to intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student accurately describes System 2 as involving conscious, careful assessment and deliberate rational thought, which matches the answer key's definition of System 2 as reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student states that 'System 1 tends to be more influential,' which correctly identifies System 1 as more dominant than System 2, satisfying the third point in the answer key.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

The representativeness heuristic involves assessing the likelihood that A is part of group B by how much A resembles members of group B. In this process, the actual probability of group B occurring is ignored (known as base-rate neglect).

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying mechanism for the assumption described in the question.
- Correct: The student accurately explains the representativeness heuristic by describing how likelihood of category membership is assessed based on resemblance to group members, and provides additional relevant detail about base-rate neglect.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring refers to the tendency for the initial piece of information received to become fixed in the mind, influencing subsequent judgments, answers, or feelings. Similarly, the primacy effect means that information encountered first is firmly established in the brain and greatly impacts the formation of impressions. Both concepts share the idea that information presented at the beginning holds more sway over our thoughts than information that follows.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as the tendency for initial information to become fixed and influence subsequent judgments, which aligns with the answer key's definition of taking first information as a starting point.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as information encountered first being firmly established and impacting impression formation, which corresponds to the answer key's point about better remembering first information.
- Correct: The student clearly identifies that both concepts share the commonality that initial/beginning information has more influence than later information, which matches the answer key's point about overreliance on first information.

Score: 1.0

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

In loss aversion, individuals strive to prevent losses, whereas in risk aversion, they tend to avoid engaging in risky situations.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves striving to prevent losses, which captures the essence of weighing losses more heavily than gains or preferring to avoid losses over equivalent gains.
- Correct: The student accurately describes risk aversion as the tendency to avoid risky situations, which aligns with the preference for certainty over uncertainty from the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias refers to the tendency to overpredict how much a decision will affect our emotions. For example, individuals who are dissatisfied in their relationship often believe that ending it will make them feel much worse and lonely. However, in reality, the effect of breaking up on their overall happiness is usually smaller than they expect.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies impact bias as overpredicting emotional effects of decisions, which aligns with overestimating the impact of future events on future feelings.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that people avoid breaking up because they believe it will make them feel much worse than it actually would, demonstrating understanding of how impact bias prevents breakups.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves anticipating your future emotions based on current choices. People tend to be inaccurate when estimating how they will feel later on. This concept is significant in end-of-life decisions due to the disability paradox, where individuals commonly assume they will be very unhappy if they become ill, disabled, or elderly, but this frequently turns out to be untrue.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies affective forecasting as predicting future emotional states, though they phrase it as 'anticipating your future emotions based on current choices' which captures the essence of the concept.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of the key application by explaining the disability paradox - that healthy people assume they'll be unhappy when sick/disabled but this often proves incorrect, which aligns with the answer key's point about preferences changing when actually experiencing illness.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

People tend to overestimate small probabilities. Specifically, they overvalue probabilities that are low but not extremely low, while they perceive extremely low probabilities as impossible.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that low probabilities are overestimated, which aligns with the answer key's point about merely low probabilities being overestimated.
- Correct: The student accurately states that extremely low probabilities are perceived as impossible, which matches the answer key's second point about extremely low probabilities being interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Individuals tend to make consistent mistakes when assessing utility, often placing greater importance on losses than on gains, which leads them to prioritize avoiding losses.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves placing greater importance on losses than on gains, which directly corresponds to the answer key's point that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

In expected value theory, you consider the likelihood and monetary value of each choice, making it an objective approach. In contrast, expected utility theory involves assessing the probability and the personal utility of outcomes, which is subjective and not necessarily tied to financial matters.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory focuses on monetary values while expected utility theory deals with personal utility that extends beyond financial matters, matching the first point in the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student mentions subjectivity in expected utility theory but does not specifically address risk aversion or how expected utility theory considers heuristics and biases while expected value theory does not, as required by the second point in the answer key.

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesnâ€™t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected value theory is a normative model that considers the probability and value of various options and is applicable only to financial decisions. Expected utility theory, also a normative model, evaluates the probability and utility of different options and is not restricted to financial contexts. Multi-attribute utility theory is a normative approach that assesses all the utilities and weights of the various attributes across options. Prospect theory, on the other hand, is a descriptive modelâ€”an extension of expected utility theoryâ€”that incorporates biases and heuristics, explaining how people actually behave instead of how they ideally should.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as a normative model involving probability and value of options, and correctly notes it applies to financial decisions.
- Correct: The student accurately describes expected utility theory as a normative model involving probability and utility, and correctly states it's not restricted to financial contexts.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies multi-attribute utility theory as a normative model that assesses utilities and weights of various attributes across options.
- Correct: The student accurately describes prospect theory as a descriptive model that incorporates biases and heuristics, and correctly relates it to expected utility theory while noting it explains actual behavior.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease peopleâ€™s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Loss aversion involves placing greater importance on losses than on gains. Individuals who are normally risk-averse tend to become even more cautious when facing potential losses. When there is an opportunity for gain, people tend to avoid risk, but when there is a possibility of loss, they are more likely to take risks.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion can make people more willing to take risks when facing potential losses, which aligns with the key point that loss aversion can decrease risk aversion and make people risk seeking. The student accurately describes the asymmetric behavior between gain and loss domains.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves learning by linking events that occur together. In classical conditioning, you connect two stimuli that frequently occur simultaneously or in close proximity. In operant conditioning, you learn to associate a specific behavior with a consequence, such as a reward or punishment.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as learning through linking/associating events that occur together, which aligns with the answer key's definition of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as connecting two stimuli that occur simultaneously or in close proximity, which matches the answer key's explanation of learning to associate things that happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning to associate behavior with consequences like rewards or punishments, which directly corresponds to the answer key's definition of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

People frequently confuse illusory correlation with causation. Illusory causation involves an actual cause-and-effect relationship, whereas in illusory correlation, people mistakenly believe there is a cause-and-effect connection when there isn't one. In such cases, an unrelated third factor might be the true cause of the observed effect.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student has the concepts backwards. They state that illusory causation involves an actual cause-and-effect relationship, but illusory causation is actually when correlation is incorrectly interpreted as causation. They also incorrectly describe illusory correlation as mistakenly believing in causation, when illusory correlation is actually perceiving correlation between variables that don't actually correlate.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to â€˜properlyâ€™ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

The Dutch healthcare system functions as a schema, which is a mental structure formed from your overall understanding of a certain concept or scenario. In contrast, the appropriate actions to take at a birthday party represent a script, since scripts are a type of social schema that focus on the sequence of behaviors expected in a given situation.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the Dutch healthcare system as a schema and provides an accurate explanation that it represents a mental structure for understanding a concept, which aligns with the answer key's point about knowledge and relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies birthday party behavior as a script and accurately explains that scripts are social schemas focusing on sequences of expected behaviors in specific situations, which matches the answer key's explanation.

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

Deliberate, as he is examining a person's behavior and thus focusing on their intentions. Observing practical or functional aspects alone will not aid in understanding behavior.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the intentional stance and misunderstands behaviorism. Behaviorists explicitly rejected focusing on mental states, intentions, or internal processes, instead adopting the physical stance by studying only observable stimulus-response relationships without considering internal mental phenomena.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

The functional perspective focuses on the particular role or usefulness of psychological processes. Approaching it from a practical or intentional viewpoint is less beneficial.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly identifies that evolutionary psychology focuses on function/usefulness but fails to explicitly name the design stance from Dennett's framework, which was specifically asked for in the question.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

The cause and effect relationship should be similar, meaning if I cause something in A, the same effect should occur in B. For instance, when I kick a ball with my feet, the ball should move accordingly. The events must be contiguous in both time and space; event B should happen immediately after and close to event A. For example, if I scratch my cat, it should start purring right away, and it must be that particular cat, not another one. The relationship should be distinct, where event B only follows event A and not other actions. So, if scratching my cat causes it to purr, hitting it should not produce the same response. The link should be consistent, meaning event B always follows event A; every time I scratch my cat, it should purr. Lastly, the connection must be plausible; it should make sense based on general knowledge that event B follows event A. For example, scratching a cat logically leads to purring, not some unrelated behavior.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies similarity in cause and effect, explaining that if you cause something in A, the same effect should occur in B, with a clear example of kicking a ball.
- Correct: The student accurately describes contiguity in time and space, explaining that event B should happen immediately after and close to event A, with a good example about scratching a cat.
- Correct: The student correctly explains distinctness, stating that event B should only follow event A and not other actions, with an appropriate example contrasting scratching vs. hitting a cat.
- Correct: The student properly identifies consistency, explaining that event B should always follow event A, with the example that scratching the cat should always result in purring.
- Correct: The student correctly describes plausibility, explaining that the connection should make sense based on general knowledge, with the logical example of scratching leading to purring.

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Negativity bias refers to the tendency for people to pay more attention to negative information. The availability heuristic involves estimating the likelihood or frequency of events based on how readily they can be recalled. When attention is mostly given to negative content like moral outrage, it is encountered more frequently and becomes easier to remember. As a result, we perceive its occurrence as more common or probable.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines negativity bias as the tendency to pay more attention to negative information, which aligns with the answer key's definition of seeking out or placing more weight on negative information.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the availability heuristic as estimating likelihood or frequency based on how readily events can be recalled, which matches the answer key's description of estimating based on ease of examples coming to mind.
- Correct: The student effectively explains the connection between the two biases - that negativity bias causes us to attend to negative content like moral outrage, making it more memorable and available, which through the availability heuristic leads to overestimating its frequency.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

Framework theories are general, intuitive beliefs about how the world operates, like the notion that heavier objects fall faster than lighter ones. Magical contagion, however, doesn't align with these framework theories because objects don't actually undergo any change when used by someone you dislike. It's not feasible for any form of "negative energy" to be transferred to the object from that person.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly identifies that magical contagion doesn't align with rational thinking, but fails to explain it in terms of framework theories for different domains. The answer key requires explaining how biological contagion concepts are incorrectly applied to social/psychological domains, but the student doesn't discuss domain-specific framework theories or cross-domain application at all.

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

Provided it adheres to the universal principles of nature.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's answer about 'universal principles of nature' does not address the key distinction between delusional and non-delusional conspiracy theories, which requires both irrationality and lack of common acceptance.

Your answer:

Be a male. Have limited education. Possess a low intelligence quotient.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'being a man' as one of the cognitive and personality factors contributing to conspiratorial thinking from the lecture material.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'having a low level of intelligence' as a factor, though phrased as 'low intelligence quotient' which is essentially the same concept.
- Incorrect: While 'limited education' relates to cognitive factors, it was not specifically listed in the answer key. The key included 'low level of analytical thinking' but not education level directly.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you donâ€™t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Primacy and recency effects suggest that the initial incorrect response will have a greater influence on forming an impression, making that information more memorable than the correct answer provided afterward.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly applies primacy and recency effects, which relate to serial position in memory tasks, not to the interference of incorrect answers with correct learning. The answer key requires explanation of source amnesia, proactive interference, or continued-influence effect as mechanisms by which incorrect answers interfere with learning the correct information.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

Spaced learning involves repeatedly reviewing information multiple times to enhance long-term retention.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes spaced learning/spaced repetition, which is about memory retention through distributed practice. This does not address the psychological mechanism of mere exposure effect or illusory-truth effect that makes repeated messages more attractive or believable to audiences.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Typically, individuals tend to have a positivity bias, believing that negative events are unlikely to affect them. However, those with major depressive disorder lack this realistic optimism and are more likely to expect unfavorable outcomes.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people with major depressive disorder are more accurate at predictions because they lack the typical positivity bias (overly optimistic tendency) that non-depressed individuals have, leading them to make more realistic assessments of negative outcomes.

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

As the accuracy of sensory information diminishes, we depend more heavily on our prior beliefs, causing these beliefs to have a greater impact. Consequently, our perception tends to align more closely with our existing expectations.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when sensory information reliability decreases, prior beliefs have greater influence on perception, and that perception aligns more with expectations. This directly matches the answer key's requirement that perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs when sensory information becomes unreliable.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You donâ€™t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other peopleâ€™s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

Pre-conventional morality involves making ethical decisions based on the possibility of rewards or punishments (like an eye for an eye). Conventional morality is judging right and wrong according to social approval, meaning actions are taken to gain others' approval. Post-conventional morality is based on evaluating actions by universal moral principles and how broadly they are accepted within society or globally.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes pre-conventional morality as focusing on rewards and punishments, which aligns with the answer key's description of obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes conventional morality as being based on social approval and others' feelings, which matches the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies post-conventional morality as being based on universal moral principles, which aligns with the answer key's description of focusing on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model suggests that events appear more rational in hindsight, making it easier to identify cause and effect. People often pay less attention to other potential outcomes of the cause. Understanding the relationship between cause and effect more clearly can lead to the sensation of "I knew it all along."

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student doesn't clearly define what a causal model is. While they mention cause and effect relationships, they don't explain that it's a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies how causal models contribute to hindsight bias by explaining that events appear more rational/inevitable in hindsight and lead to the 'I knew it all along' sensation, which aligns with the key point about events seeming more inevitable than they were.

Score: 0.5

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Learning refers to the phenomenon where individuals are unable to ignore newly acquired information when reflecting on past events (known as the curse of knowledge). Once people have learned what occurred, it reinforces their sense that they "knew it all along."

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly explains that learning contributes to hindsight bias by making it impossible to ignore newly acquired information when reflecting on past events, and appropriately identifies this as the curse of knowledge. The answer captures the core mechanism of how learning interferes with accurate recall of past likelihood judgments.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing involves striving to select the best possible option, while satisficing means choosing an option that is satisfactory or adequate. Individuals who score highly in neuroticism are more likely to use a maximizing approach when making decisions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as striving to select the best possible option, which aligns with the answer key's definition of trying to make the best choice.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as choosing an option that is satisfactory or adequate, which matches the answer key's definition of making a good-enough choice.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that individuals high in neuroticism are more likely to use a maximizing approach, which directly matches the answer key.

Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

I would definitely use AI, just as was done in this course. When properly trained, AI can perform tasks like grading similarly to how a professor would. The chatbot AI created was also very useful, since it has unlimited time and resources to provide personalized responses to questions. Another approach is for the professor to record videos explaining topics in more detail than is possible during lectures, allowing students to watch these recordings at home whenever they need additional clarification.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement with the question by providing multiple concrete strategies (AI grading, chatbot implementation, recorded videos) that directly address the constraint of limited time and resources while promoting student engagement. The answer shows understanding of how technology can scale personalized support and references specific tools from the course experience.

Score: 1.0
