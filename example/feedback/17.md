## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidtâ€™s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

According to this model, system 1 is the most dominant because it relates to intuitive thinking: we naturally possess certain morals without needing to consciously think about them (for example, believing incest is wrong). System 2, which involves deliberate reflection, tends to support these intuitive judgments, even in the face of limited logical reasons.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 relates to intuitive thinking and provides a good example of moral intuitions (believing incest is wrong without conscious deliberation).
- Correct: The student correctly identifies System 2 as involving deliberate reflection, which aligns with the answer key's description of reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student clearly states that System 1 is most dominant and explains that System 2 tends to support intuitive judgments rather than override them, which accurately reflects Haidt's model.

Score: 1.0

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

The representativeness heuristic is when we judge the probability of something being part of a group based on how closely it resembles that group, without considering other factors like how uncommon the group actually is.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process in this scenario.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that the representativeness heuristic involves judging probability of category membership based on resemblance to that category, which matches the core concept from the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring refers to the tendency to interpret new information based on the initial information received. The primacy effect describes how the first information we encounter influences us more strongly than information we receive afterward. Both concepts highlight how the initial information carries greater significance than subsequent information.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as being related to using initial information as a reference point, though they describe it as interpreting new information based on initial information rather than using it as a starting point. This captures the essential concept.
- Incorrect: The student describes the primacy effect as initial information influencing us more strongly, but fails to specifically mention that it relates to better remembering the first piece of information. The answer focuses on influence rather than memory.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both concepts involve the initial information carrying greater significance than subsequent information, which captures the essence of overreliance on first information.

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency of individuals to perceive losses as more significant than gains, while risk aversion is the preference for certainty rather than uncertainty.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves perceiving losses as more significant than gains, which matches the answer key's description of weighing losses more heavily than gains.
- Correct: The student accurately describes risk aversion as the preference for certainty rather than uncertainty, which directly corresponds to the answer key's definition.

Score: 1.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias refers to the tendency to overestimate the emotional effect an event will have on us. This can stop individuals from ending unhappy relationships because they anticipate feeling far more upset after the breakup than they truly will, leading to fear of ending the relationship.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies impact bias as overestimating the emotional effect of future events, which aligns with the answer key's definition of overestimating the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that impact bias prevents breakups by causing people to overestimate how upset they will feel after breaking up, which matches the answer key's point about overestimating how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

When making end-of-life decisions, it is crucial to consider predictions about your future mental state because healthy individuals frequently assume they would prefer death over living with illness or disability (known as affective forecasting). However, when people experience illness or disability, they often revise their perspective and feel differently (referred to as the disability paradox).

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies affective forecasting as predictions about future mental/emotional state, which aligns with the answer key's definition of predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that healthy people predict they would prefer death when sick, but when actually experiencing illness they often feel differently, which matches the answer key's second point about the contrast between predicted and actual preferences.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

People often underestimate small probabilities, with a distinction between low and extremely low probabilities, as extremely low probabilities may be perceived as impossible.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student states that people 'underestimate small probabilities' which contradicts the answer key that merely low probabilities are 'overestimated'.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that extremely low probabilities may be perceived as impossible, which aligns with the answer key point about them being interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 0.5

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

We experience losses more strongly than equivalent gains, making prospect theory asymmetrical; a loss and a gain of the same amount will have different levels of utility, with the loss potentially being valued at -5 utility and the gain at only +2 utility.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly explains that loss aversion means losses are felt more strongly than equivalent gains, making the utility function asymmetrical. The specific example of -5 utility for a loss versus +2 utility for an equivalent gain clearly demonstrates that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory applies solely to financial choices, whereas expected utility theory can be utilized in various situations and is more subjective than expected value theory.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory applies to financial choices while expected utility theory has broader application beyond just financial values, capturing the essence of the first key difference.
- Incorrect: The student mentions subjectivity but fails to identify the specific concept of risk aversion that distinguishes expected utility theory from expected value theory's assumption of risk neutrality.

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesnâ€™t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected value theory is normative and involves calculating the probability of each option and selecting the one with the highest expected value; it is primarily applicable to financial decisions. Expected utility theory is also normative; it requires assigning a utility to each option, determining their importance, performing a calculation, and choosing the option with the greatest utility. Multi-attribute utility theory, another normative approach, involves identifying all attributes and alternatives, assigning importance to each attribute, scoring them based on utility, summing the scores for each alternative, and selecting the best one. Prospect theory, which is descriptive and developed by Kahneman and Tversky, is based on three main assumptions: people evaluate outcomes in terms of gains and losses rather than absolute values; they often misjudge utility, tending to overestimate medium to high utilities while displaying loss aversion; and they generally misinterpret probabilities, overestimating low probabilities and treating extremely low or high probabilities as impossible or certain.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as normative and explains it involves calculating probabilities and selecting the highest expected value option, with appropriate mention of financial applications.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected utility theory as normative and explains the key concept of assigning utilities to outcomes, though they could have been clearer about utility being subjective rather than just financial.
- Correct: The student accurately describes multi-attribute utility theory as normative, correctly explaining the process of identifying attributes, assigning importance/weights, scoring utilities, and selecting the best alternative.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies prospect theory as descriptive, mentions Kahneman and Tversky as developers, and explains key behavioral aspects including reference point dependence, loss aversion, and probability weighting biases.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease peopleâ€™s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

We tend to avoid risky situations when there is a chance of suffering a loss (risk aversion), but we may become risk-seeking if we have already invested resources that cannot be recovered and want to prevent further losses.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion can make people risk-seeking when trying to avoid or recover from losses, which aligns with the key point that loss aversion decreases risk aversion and can make people risk seeking.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves learning by making connections. Classical conditioning occurs when you frequently experience two events together, causing you to link them. Operant conditioning is learning that your behavior leads to rewards or punishments, so you adjust your actions based on the outcomes.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as learning through making connections/associations, which aligns with the answer key's definition of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as learning when two events are frequently experienced together, which matches the answer key's explanation of associating things that happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning that behavior leads to rewards or punishments and adjusting actions based on outcomes, which aligns with the answer key's definition of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation occurs when one perceives a cause-and-effect connection that is only a correlation, while illusory correlation involves perceiving a correlation between two things when no actual relationship exists.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly distinguishes between illusory causation (misinterpreting correlation as causation) and illusory correlation (perceiving correlation where none exists). The explanation captures the key difference that illusory causation involves real correlation being misinterpreted, while illusory correlation involves no actual relationship at all.

Score: 1.0

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to â€˜properlyâ€™ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

schema: the structure of the Dutch healthcare system â€“ this is a schema similar to using heuristics and framework theories to grasp a complicated system; script: appropriate behavior at a birthday party â€“ this is a typical scenario where the script acts as a social schema, guiding you to, for example, congratulate everyone present.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the Dutch healthcare system as a schema and provides appropriate reasoning, explaining it involves understanding a complicated system's structure and framework, which aligns with schemas being knowledge structures about relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies birthday party behavior as a script and demonstrates understanding by explaining it's a social schema that guides specific situational behavior (like congratulating everyone), which matches the answer key's definition of scripts as behavioral guides for specific situations.

Score: 1.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

From a mechanical perspective, they aimed to understand how stimuli functioned and initiated behavior, focusing on the process rather than the reason behind it, which is a very mechanical approach.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that behaviorists adopted a mechanical/physical approach by focusing on how stimuli functioned to initiate behavior and emphasizing process over reasoning, which aligns with the physical stance's focus on causal mechanisms.

Score: 1.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

From a functional or design perspective, they understand our actions based on how useful they are to us and how they improve our situation.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that evolutionary psychologists adopt a functional/design perspective and accurately explains that this involves understanding psychological processes based on their usefulness and benefits, which aligns with the design stance's focus on function.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

unique: B (my cat purrs) only happens if A (e.g., scratches) occurs specifically consistent: B occurs nearly every time A takes place close in space and time: B follows soon after A each time plausible: given what I know about B, it makes sense that A causes it alike in cause and effect: whenever I perform action A (e.g., move my leg a certain way), B (the ball gets kicked) happens

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies distinctness/specificity with a clear example showing B only occurs with specific A, not other events.
- Correct: Student accurately describes consistency as B occurring nearly every time A happens, demonstrating understanding of the regularity aspect.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies contiguity in time and space, noting that B follows soon after A, showing understanding of temporal proximity.
- Correct: Student properly explains plausibility as making sense based on knowledge, demonstrating understanding of the common sense criterion.
- Correct: Student correctly describes similarity in cause and effect with a relevant example of leg movement causing ball kicking, showing understanding of resemblance between A and B.

Score: 1.0

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Negativity bias refers to our inclination to focus on negative information, which also has a stronger impact on us and is more memorable than positive information. Availability bias occurs because negative content is easier to recall. Combined, these biases lead us to actively look for negative information and remember it clearly, causing us to overestimate how often it occurs.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias as the tendency to focus on negative information and notes its stronger impact and memorability, which aligns with the answer key's description of seeking out or placing more weight on negative information.
- Incorrect: The student mentions 'availability bias' but doesn't properly define the availability heuristic as estimating frequency based on ease of recall. They only mention that negative content is easier to recall without explaining the core mechanism of frequency estimation.
- Correct: The student correctly explains how the two biases work together - negativity bias makes us focus on negative information which becomes more memorable, and this leads to overestimating frequency, which captures the essential interaction described in the answer key.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

It involves applying what you understand from one area to another using framework theories, so if I know I dislike a person, that dislike extends from the person to something that once belonged to them.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes the general process of applying knowledge from one domain to another but fails to identify the specific domains involved. The answer key requires recognizing that biological contagion concepts are being incorrectly applied to the social/psychological domain, which the student does not mention.

Score: 0.0

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A conspiracy theory that is delusional is generally rejected by the public, whereas a non-delusional one is accepted.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student only addresses the 'commonly accepted' criterion but fails to mention that delusional conspiracy theories must also be irrational beliefs. The answer is incomplete as it misses the key distinction about irrationality that separates delusional from non-delusional conspiracy theories.

Score: 0.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

Recognize order in chaos, embrace masculinity, and rise from a challenging upbringing.

Feedback:

- Correct: "Recognize order in chaos" corresponds to seeing patterns in randomness, which is one of the cognitive factors mentioned in the answer key.
- Correct: "Embrace masculinity" relates to being a man, which is listed as one of the personality factors in the answer key.
- Incorrect: "Rise from a challenging upbringing" does not match any of the factors listed in the answer key such as narcissism, low intelligence, low analytical thinking, or the other cognitive biases mentioned.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you donâ€™t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

The persistence of first impressions, even when you deliberately try to alter them.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's answer about 'persistence of first impressions' is too vague and doesn't specifically identify the psychological mechanisms mentioned in the answer key (source amnesia, proactive interference, or continued-influence effect). While it touches on the general concept that initial information can persist, it lacks the precision and technical terminology expected for this psychology exam question.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

simple familiarity through repeated contact

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the core concept of mere exposure - that familiarity gained through repeated contact leads to increased preference, which is exactly the psychological mechanism politicians use when repeating statements.

Score: 1.0

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Major depressive disorder can enhance individuals' accuracy in making these predictions, as they typically lack a positivity bias.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that major depressive disorder enhances accuracy in predictions and correctly explains this is due to the lack of positivity bias (equivalent to reduced optimism bias mentioned in the answer key).

Score: 1.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

When the reliability of sensory information diminishes, the posterior will be more influenced by the prior belief.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when sensory information reliability decreases, prior beliefs have increased influence on perception. The use of Bayesian terminology ('posterior' and 'prior belief') demonstrates understanding of the ideal observer model framework.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You donâ€™t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other peopleâ€™s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

Pre-conventional: driven by avoiding punishment and seeking rewards; focused on oneself. Conventional: motivated by maintaining a good reputation and following laws; concerned with others' feelings. Post-conventional: recognizing that moral principles can clash; guided by universal ethical values.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the pre-conventional level as being driven by avoiding punishment and seeking rewards, which matches the answer key's focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as being motivated by maintaining reputation, following laws, and being concerned with others' feelings, which aligns with the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the post-conventional level as being guided by universal ethical values and recognizing conflicts between moral principles, which matches the answer key's focus on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

It is a model that explains how individuals often attribute causes to events to understand them. In hindsight bias, even if events occurred by chance, people convince themselves they predicted the outcome all along and view it as more certain than it truly was.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a causal model involves attributing causes to events to understand them, which aligns with the concept of a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student accurately explains how causal models contribute to hindsight bias by making people view outcomes as more certain and predictable than they actually were, which matches the key point about events seeming more inevitable.

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

It is challenging to ignore the new information you have acquired since making your likelihood estimate.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that newly acquired information cannot be ignored when estimating past likelihood judgments, which captures the core mechanism of how learning contributes to hindsight bias.

Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing involves striving to choose the very best option, while satisficing means seeking a choice that is good enough. Individuals who score high in neuroticism are more likely to use the maximizing approach.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as 'striving to choose the very best option,' which aligns with the answer key's definition of 'trying to make the best choice.'
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as 'seeking a choice that is good enough,' which matches the answer key's definition of 'making a good-enough choice.'
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that individuals high in neuroticism are more likely to use the maximizing approach, which matches the answer key's statement about adopting the maximizing decision style.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

I would draw inspiration from this course but create two brief, concise assignments focused on libertarian paternalism that can largely be evaluated by AI. Instead of grades, I would use a straightforward pass-fail system, and I would review the submissions only out of interest. Completing these assignments would be mandatory to qualify for the exam.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement by proposing a specific, practical solution that addresses the constraint of limited time and resources. They suggest AI-assisted evaluation, pass-fail grading to reduce workload, and mandatory completion as a participation mechanism. The answer shows thoughtful consideration of the trade-offs between engagement and efficiency.
