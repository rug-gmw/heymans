## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

According to Haidt's model, moral judgments arise from intuition, and we may view a situation as unlikely despite logical reasons supporting it. Moreover, moral reasoning occurs after the judgment has been made, serving as an explanation rather than the cause. In this context, System 1 thinking drives the moral judgment by reflecting our intuitive and emotional responses, while System 2 is involved in providing reasons to justify that moral judgment.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 thinking involves intuitive and emotional responses in moral judgment, which aligns with the answer key's description of System 1 as intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student accurately describes System 2 as being involved in providing reasons to justify moral judgments, which corresponds to the answer key's characterization of System 2 as reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student clearly indicates that System 1 drives moral judgment while System 2 serves to justify afterward, demonstrating understanding that System 1 (intuition/emotion) is more dominant than System 2 (reasoning).

Score: 1.0

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

This is an example of the representativeness heuristic, where we assess the probability that something belongs to a particular category based on how closely it matches the typical image or stereotype of that category. Simply put, if A appears similar to B, we tend to assume A is B.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive bias in this scenario.
- Correct: The student provides an accurate explanation of the representativeness heuristic, describing how we assess probability based on similarity to stereotypes or typical images of a category, which matches the key concept that likelihood is estimated based on resemblance to category stereotypes.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring occurs when the first piece of information provided about a topic serves as a reference point, with subsequent information used to modify this starting point for the final judgment. The primacy effect happens when the initial information disproportionately shapes the overall impression or outcome regarding a subject. In both situations, the initial information impacts the final conclusion, but they do so in different ways.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as using the first piece of information as a reference point or starting point, which aligns with the answer key definition.
- Incorrect: The student describes primacy effect as initial information shaping overall impression rather than specifically about better remembering first information, which is what the answer key requires.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both phenomena involve the initial/first information impacting final conclusions, demonstrating understanding of their common overreliance on first information.

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion involves giving greater importance to losses than to gains of the same size, while risk aversion is the preference for sure outcomes rather than uncertain ones.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves giving greater importance to losses than to gains of the same size, which accurately captures the concept that losses are weighted more heavily than equivalent gains.
- Correct: The student accurately describes risk aversion as the preference for sure outcomes rather than uncertain ones, which correctly captures the tendency to prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 1.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias occurs when people overestimate how strongly an event will affect them. For example, someone might believe that a breakup will impact them more severely than it truly will, leading them to stay in an unhappy relationship.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as overestimating how strongly an event will affect them, which captures the essence of overestimating the impact of future events on future feelings.
- Correct: The student clearly explains how impact bias prevents breakups by stating people believe a breakup will impact them more severely than it truly will, leading them to stay in unhappy relationships.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves anticipating one's future emotional feelings, which is important to consider in end-of-life decisions. People may believe they want to end their life when they become very old or ill, but their feelings might change when that moment arrives, leading to ethical challenges. Therefore, it can be helpful to account for various potential emotional states at the time to facilitate decision-making and prevent ethical conflicts.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies affective forecasting as predicting/anticipating future emotional states, which matches the answer key's definition of 'predictions about our own future emotional state.'
- Correct: The student accurately captures the key concept that people may predict they'll want to die when sick/old but their feelings may change when actually facing that situation, which aligns with the answer key's point about healthy people predicting preference to die but potentially not preferring it when actually sick.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

Individuals may overvalue small probabilities yet regard extremely unlikely events as impossible. For example, a 10% chance might be exaggerated, whereas a 0.01% chance could be seen as nonexistent.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that small probabilities (like 10%) are overvalued/exaggerated, which aligns with prospect theory's finding that merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that extremely low probabilities (like 0.01%) are treated as nonexistent/impossible, which matches the answer key's point about extremely low probabilities being interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion causes losses to feel more significant than equal gains, which negatively affects our emotions because losing money is painful, resulting in negative utility.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion means losses are weighed more heavily than equivalent gains, which aligns with the key concept that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities in prospect theory.

Score: 1.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory is a normative framework that examines how financial or economic choices ought to be made by assigning probabilities to various outcomes and determining the best option by multiplying each outcome's value by its probability. Expected utility theory is similar but extends this concept by incorporating utility, which need not be financial and can represent a subjective experience.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory deals with financial/economic values while expected utility theory incorporates utility that 'need not be financial' and represents 'subjective experience', which aligns with the answer key's distinction between financial vs non-financial values.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention risk aversion or heuristics and biases. They focus on the normative aspect and mathematical framework but miss the key behavioral distinction that expected utility theory considers risk aversion while expected value theory does not.

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected value theory is a normative framework that examines how financial or economic choices ought to be made by assigning values and probabilities to various outcomes, assuming full information and computational capability. Expected utility theory is similar but recognizes that outcomes are influenced not only by financial factors but also by subjective utility. Multi-attribute theory aligns with these models but considers that each option comprises multiple attributes, each assigned a weight and utility. Prospect theory builds upon expected utility theory by incorporating heuristics and biases into the decision-making process.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as a normative model dealing with financial outcomes and probabilities, capturing the key elements from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes expected utility theory as similar to expected value theory but incorporating subjective utility beyond just financial outcomes, matching the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly explains multi-attribute utility theory as involving multiple attributes with weights and utilities, though they call it 'multi-attribute theory' rather than the full name.
- Correct: The student accurately describes prospect theory as building on expected utility theory while incorporating heuristics and biases, correctly identifying it as accounting for behavioral factors.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Loss aversion means that people tend to give greater importance to losses than to equivalent gains. Therefore, when a situation is presented in terms of gains (known as gain framing) rather than losses, individuals are more likely to avoid risks because they want to prevent the chance of experiencing losses.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly defines loss aversion but reaches the opposite conclusion. They state that people are more risk averse when trying to avoid losses, whereas the answer key indicates that loss aversion makes people willing to accept risk to avoid potential losses, potentially making them risk-seeking rather than risk-averse.

Score: 0.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning is the process of learning by associating events. Classical conditioning involves learning when two or more events occur simultaneously or close together in time and place. Operant conditioning is learning based on the consequences of specific behaviors, where actions are followed by rewards.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as a learning process involving associations between events, which aligns with the answer key's definition of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as learning when events occur simultaneously or close together in time and place, which matches the answer key's explanation of associating things that happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning based on consequences of behaviors where actions are followed by rewards, which aligns with the answer key's description of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation occurs when we mistakenly believe that one event causes another simply because they happen at the same time or place, even though there is no real connection. Illusory correlation happens when we perceive relationships or patterns in data that are not actually there.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly distinguishes between illusory causation (mistakenly inferring causation from correlation/co-occurrence) and illusory correlation (perceiving correlations that don't actually exist). While the phrasing differs from the answer key, the core concepts are accurately captured.

Score: 1.0

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

Knowing how the Dutch healthcare system functions is a schema because it offers broad knowledge and context about a situation, while appropriate behavior at a birthday party is a script, giving guidance on how to act in a recurring social event.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the Dutch healthcare system as a schema and provides an appropriate explanation that it involves broad knowledge and context, which aligns with schemas being knowledge structures about relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies birthday party behavior as a script and explains it as guidance for acting in a recurring social event, which matches the concept of scripts as behavioral sequences for specific situations.

Score: 1.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

The design stance involves examining the brain by attempting to gather information about it, but since direct measurement is not feasible, alternative methods like using stimuli are employed. This approach focuses on understanding how the brain is structured and the reasons behind its design, aiming to uncover the purpose of particular brain regions.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the design stance instead of the physical stance. The student's description of using stimuli due to measurement limitations doesn't align with behaviorism's focus on stimulus-response relationships as physical processes, and mischaracterizes the design stance as being about brain structure rather than functional purpose.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

They adopt the intentional stance because it offers understanding of interpersonal relationships and human behavior. It examines situations similar to "Why did my friend ignore me?"—events that involve interactions between people.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the intentional stance instead of the design stance. While they mention understanding human behavior, they focus on interpersonal interactions rather than the functional/evolutionary purpose of psychological processes, which is the key characteristic of the design stance in evolutionary psychology.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Events A and B need to be clear and well-defined to be considered; if they are too vague, they may go unnoticed. They must occur consistently, not just occasionally. Both events should take place within a similar time frame and location to be recognized. Comparable relationships can be seen in other correlations—for instance, if B follows A's movement, a real-life example might be a football rolling after it is kicked. Lastly, the connection between events A and B should be logical and believable.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student mentions events need to be 'clear and well-defined' which relates to distinctness/specificity, though the explanation is somewhat vague and doesn't clearly articulate that B should follow A but not other events.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that events 'must occur consistently, not just occasionally' which directly corresponds to the consistency heuristic that B should always follow A.
- Correct: The student states 'the connection between events A and B should be logical and believable' which accurately captures the plausibility heuristic requiring common sense support for causation.
- Correct: The student mentions 'both events should take place within a similar time frame and location' which correctly identifies the contiguity in time and space heuristic.
- Incorrect: The student discusses 'comparable relationships' and provides a football example, but fails to identify the similarity in cause and effect heuristic where A and B should superficially resemble each other. The football example actually demonstrates causation rather than similarity between cause and effect.

Score: 0.8

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

The availability heuristic occurs when recalling an example of a morally outraged individual on social media causes us to overestimate how common such outrage is. Confirmation bias reinforces this by making us more likely to accept the idea that many people are morally outraged, since the memory supports our existing belief.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student does not mention negativity bias, which is one of the two primary biases identified in the answer key that contributes to overestimating moral outrage on social media.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the availability heuristic and accurately explains how recalling examples of moral outrage leads to overestimating its frequency.
- Incorrect: The student does not explain the causal relationship between negativity bias and availability heuristic as described in the answer key. Instead, they introduce confirmation bias, which is not part of the correct explanation.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

Framework theories offer broad, shared understanding and rely on knowledge from three key areas—biology, physics, and psychology—to navigate everyday life. When knowledge from one area is mistakenly applied to another, superstitions can develop. These are irrational beliefs that do not adhere to scientific principles or religious doctrines, like karma and similar ideas.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that framework theories involve knowledge from different domains (biology, physics, psychology) and explains that superstitions arise when knowledge from one domain is incorrectly applied to another. This captures the core concept that magical contagion involves the misapplication of biological contagion concepts to social/psychological domains.

Score: 1.0

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

Delusional conspiracies are irrational beliefs involving conspiracies that are not accepted by the culture. In contrast, non-delusional conspiracies are those that are widely recognized and frequently discussed within a culture, despite lacking confirmation.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that delusional conspiracy theories are irrational beliefs that are not commonly accepted (or as they put it, 'not accepted by the culture'), and distinguishes this from non-delusional conspiracy theories which are widely recognized within a culture. This matches the key distinction in the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

Individuals who prefer straightforward solutions to complicated issues, those inclined to believe in the paranormal, people who adopt an us-versus-them mindset, those who lack rational thinking, individuals who feel morally outraged, and those exhibiting narcissistic traits.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student mentions 'those inclined to believe in the paranormal' which directly matches 'believing paranormal phenomena' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student mentions 'individuals who prefer straightforward solutions to complicated issues' which corresponds to 'believing in simple explanations for complex events' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student mentions 'those exhibiting narcissistic traits' which directly matches 'being narcissistic' from the answer key.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Conditioning, which involves learning by associating events, in this instance seeing the correct answer instead of our own serves as a form of punishment that helps us learn the right response.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes conditioning and punishment as learning mechanisms, but this doesn't address how incorrect answers interfere with learning. The answer key requires explanation of source amnesia, proactive interference, or continued-influence effect - psychological mechanisms where incorrect answers create confusion or interference with correct information, not learning enhancement.

Score: 0.0

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

This may involve the recency effect, which benefits memory, and through repeated exposure, people are more likely to be influenced. It can also serve as a distraction from negative events, functioning as a way to use social media as a diversion. Additionally, it enables individuals to emphasize the positive elements of their politics, helping them shape their political message by consistently focusing on the favorable aspects to better appeal to the public.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions 'repeated exposure' which hints at the correct concept, but does not identify the specific psychological mechanism of mere exposure effect or illusory-truth effect. Instead, they discuss recency effect, distraction, and political messaging strategies, which are not the psychological mechanisms the question is asking about.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Individuals with Major Depressive Disorder tend to exhibit a negativity bias, causing them to perceive the world as darker than it truly is, and as a result, they may believe negative events occur more frequently than they do. In contrast, those without the disorder are less prone to this bias and more likely to have a positivity bias, leading them to underestimate the chances of negative events. Overall, people with the disorder may overestimate the likelihood of negative outcomes, while those without it may underestimate them, with the actual probability being random.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that people with major depressive disorder overestimate negative outcomes due to negativity bias, when the answer key indicates they are actually more accurate because they have reduced optimism bias. The student misunderstands that depressed individuals' predictions are closer to reality, not more pessimistic than reality.

Score: 0.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

As the trustworthiness of sensory information diminishes, the trust in the evidence grows. This leads to a greater impact of prior beliefs, causing perception to align more closely with those prior beliefs.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly identifies that prior beliefs have greater impact when sensory reliability decreases, but contains a contradictory statement saying 'trust in the evidence grows' when sensory information diminishes, which is logically inconsistent with the premise.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

Pre-conventional: moral decisions are based on personal gain. Conventional: moral decisions are influenced by the desire for social acceptance. Post-conventional: moral decisions are guided by universal principles.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that pre-conventional level focuses on personal gain, which aligns with the answer key's description of avoiding punishment or gaining rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes conventional level as being influenced by desire for social acceptance, which matches the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies post-conventional level as being guided by universal principles, which aligns with the answer key's description of focus on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model emphasizes the events that led to a particular outcome in a given situation. This promotes hindsight bias by forming a clear narrative of how the events unfolded, ignoring other possible explanations and making the outcome appear unavoidable, which is characteristic of hindsight bias.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a causal model emphasizes events leading to an outcome and forms a clear narrative, which aligns with the answer key's description of a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student accurately explains how causal models contribute to hindsight bias by making outcomes appear unavoidable/inevitable, which directly matches the answer key's point about events seeming more inevitable than they were.

Score: 1.0

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Hindsight bias is the tendency to view an event as unavoidable after it has occurred, making it difficult to assess the outcome without considering the information we have gained afterward. As a result, the outcome appears to have been certain.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly defines hindsight bias but does not address how learning specifically contributes to it. The answer key requires explaining that newly learned information cannot be avoided when estimating past likelihood judgments, but the student only describes the general phenomenon without connecting it to the learning mechanism.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing decision style involves aiming to choose the best possible option to meet our needs, while satisficing means selecting an option that is adequate or satisfactory. Individuals who score high in neuroticism tend to lean more towards a maximizing decision style, as it is associated with feelings of regret, depression, and perfectionism.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as aiming to choose the best possible option, which aligns with the answer key's definition of 'trying to make the best choice.'
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as selecting an option that is adequate or satisfactory, which matches the answer key's definition of 'making a good-enough choice.'

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

To capture the students' attention, I would consider presenting statistical data comparing the pass rates of those who attend lectures and complete their readings with those who only show up for the exam. I would use relative proportions rather than raw numbers, as they more effectively emphasize the drawbacks of missing classes. This approach would likely create a sense of urgency, encouraging more students to attend and participate actively.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement with the question by proposing a specific, practical strategy (using statistical comparisons of pass rates) to motivate student engagement. They show thoughtful consideration of implementation details (using relative proportions vs. raw numbers) and explain the psychological reasoning behind their approach (creating urgency). While the answer could be more comprehensive in addressing the resource constraints mentioned in the question, it reflects genuine effort to solve the pedagogical challenge presented.
