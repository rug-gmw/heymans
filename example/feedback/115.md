## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

The Representative Heuristic explains this assumption. It works by suggesting that if something shares traits common to most members of group A, it is probably part of group A. However, this heuristic is biased because people often overlook the base rates. For instance, even if a colleague resembles a model, since only a small number of people are actually models, it is unlikely that he is one solely based on his appearance.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process, though with a minor spelling variation ('Representative' instead of 'representativeness').
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of the heuristic by explaining that we judge category membership based on resemblance to typical group members, which aligns with the concept of estimating likelihood based on stereotypical features.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring is a psychological phenomenon that happens when we come across new information and instead of modifying our current understanding, we form a new guideline based on it. This initial information tends to have a stronger influence on us because it "anchors" our view on the subject. The primacy effect is related but pertains more to memory; it means we tend to remember things we see first more clearly, like the first item in a list. Both effects cause us to give greater significance to the first information or stimuli we experience.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes anchoring as forming new guidelines based on initial information, but misses the key concept that anchoring involves using the first piece of information as a starting point for subsequent judgments or decisions.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that the primacy effect involves better remembering first information, specifically mentioning remembering the first item in a list more clearly.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both effects involve giving greater significance to first information, which aligns with the concept of overreliance on initial information.

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion is a tendency where individuals give greater importance to losses than they objectively deserve and often seek to avoid losing. Risk aversion refers to a reluctance to engage in risky decisions, even when the potential gains and losses are roughly equal. However, risk aversion can be influenced by how the situation is presented, even if the underlying outcomes remain unchanged.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves giving greater importance to losses and seeking to avoid them, which aligns with the key concept that losses are weighted more heavily than gains.
- Incorrect: The student describes risk aversion as reluctance to engage in risky decisions when gains and losses are equal, but misses the core concept that risk aversion is fundamentally about preferring certainty over uncertainty regardless of outcome equality.

Score: 0.5

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias refers to the tendency to exaggerate the emotional effects that future events will have. This bias can cause individuals to avoid ending relationships, despite feeling unhappy, because they believe the emotional pain from a breakup will be overwhelming, even though there are likely positive factors associated with the separation that could improve their happiness.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as the tendency to exaggerate the emotional effects of future events, which matches the answer key's definition of overestimating the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that impact bias prevents breakups because people believe the emotional pain will be overwhelming, which aligns with the answer key's point about overestimating how bad a breakup will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves anticipating how you will feel in future situations. This concept is crucial in end-of-life decisions because individuals tend to inaccurately predict their future emotions. Due to a negativity bias, people often expect to be much more unhappy if they develop severe dementia and may ask their loved ones to end their lives when their condition worsens. However, once they actually experience dementia, they frequently alter their perspective.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines affective forecasting as anticipating or predicting future emotions, which aligns with the answer key's definition of 'predictions about our own future emotional state.'
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of the key concept by explaining that people inaccurately predict their future emotions and may change their perspective when actually experiencing illness (dementia), which parallels the answer key's point about healthy people predicting they'd prefer to die when sick but potentially not preferring death when actually sick.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

People tend to undervalue moderate probabilities, such as 10%, but overvalue extremely small probabilities, like 0.01%. Although such tiny probabilities are practically negligible, people often perceive them as having a slight possibility when, in reality, they are almost impossible.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student states that people 'undervalue moderate probabilities, such as 10%' which contradicts the answer key that says merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Incorrect: The student claims people 'overvalue extremely small probabilities, like 0.01%' and perceive them as having 'slight possibility', which contradicts the answer key that says extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 0.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion represents people's fear of experiencing negative outcomes, highlighting the psychological impact of loss as particularly unfavorable. From the perspective of prospect theory, losing is linked to a significant negative utility that affects an individual's mental state.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes loss aversion as fear of negative outcomes and mentions negative utility from losses, but fails to capture the key concept that losses are weighted more heavily than equivalent gains, or that the value function is steeper for losses than gains.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory focuses mainly on monetary gains and losses, which is why it is called expected "value" theory. In contrast, expected utility theory centers on utility instead of just financial value, encompassing a broader concept of utility that may include financial gains and losses as well as other factors. For instance, a nation might increase its wealth by exploiting labor, but this exploitation would result in a decrease in overall utility due to the negative impact on its population.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory focuses on monetary/financial values while expected utility theory encompasses broader utility concepts including non-financial factors. The labor exploitation example effectively illustrates this distinction.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention risk aversion or heuristics and biases as key differences between the theories. While they discuss utility broadly, they miss the specific point about expected utility theory's consideration of risk aversion compared to expected value theory's lack of consideration for such behavioral factors.

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected value theory is a normative approach focused on maximizing financial outcomes. Expected utility theory is a normative model aimed at maximizing overall utility. Multi-aspect expected utility theory is also normative, considering multiple factors and impacts on various groups for each decision. Prospect theory integrates expected utility theory with human biases and heuristics.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as normative and mentions financial outcomes, which aligns with the key point about choosing between options with financial outcomes and probabilities.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected utility theory as normative and focused on maximizing utility, capturing the essence that outcomes have utility beyond just financial value.
- Incorrect: The student calls it 'Multi-aspect expected utility theory' instead of 'Multi-attribute utility theory' and describes it as considering impacts on various groups rather than multiple attributes with utilities and weights.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies prospect theory as integrating expected utility theory with human biases and heuristics, which captures the descriptive/behavioral nature and consideration of heuristics and biases.

Score: 0.75

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Loss aversion influences how risk averse individuals are because they place greater importance on losses, which distorts their view of risk and increases their tendency to avoid it. As a result, they hesitate to take risks even when the potential gains and losses are evenly balanced.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that loss aversion increases risk aversion and makes people avoid risks. The answer key indicates that loss aversion can actually decrease risk aversion and make people risk-seeking when they face potential losses, as they become willing to accept risk to avoid those losses.

Score: 0.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning refers to the mental process of linking two related conditions, resulting in a behavioral change. Classical conditioning involves forming a connection between two stimuli, such as Pavlov's dogs learning to salivate at the sound of a bell because it was consistently paired with feeding. Operant conditioning, on the other hand, involves shaping behavior through rewards and punishments—desired actions are reinforced with rewards, while undesired actions are discouraged through punishments. This method effectively trains behavior.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as a learning process that involves linking or associating conditions/stimuli, which aligns with the concept of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as forming connections between two stimuli and provides the relevant Pavlov example, demonstrating understanding that things happening together in time and space become associated.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as shaping behavior through rewards and punishments, clearly showing understanding that actions lead to consequences (rewards or punishments).

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation occurs when someone incorrectly believes that A caused B or that B caused A, while illusory correlation is the mistaken belief that there is a relationship or connection between A and B when none actually exists.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly distinguishes between illusory causation (incorrectly interpreting a relationship as causal) and illusory correlation (perceiving a correlation that doesn't actually exist). The explanation accurately captures that illusory causation involves misattributing causality while illusory correlation involves perceiving non-existent correlations.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

A script refers to the typical guidelines for behavior and communication within a specific culture, such as how to act appropriately at a birthday party. In this example, your knowledge of the Dutch Healthcare system serves as a schema, providing the information and framework needed to understand and interpret that system.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that understanding the Dutch healthcare system is a schema and provides an appropriate explanation that it provides information and framework for understanding, which aligns with schemas being knowledge structures about relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script and accurately explains it as guidelines for behavior in a specific cultural context, which matches the answer key's description of scripts as social schemas for specific situations.

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

The behaviorist approach aligns most closely with the Design level of analysis. Since they believed the physical mind was unmeasurable and that people's intentions behind decisions were often unclear, they focused on observing cause-and-effect relationships through the design perspective to better understand how the mind works.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the design stance instead of the physical stance. While they correctly understand that behaviorists focused on cause-and-effect relationships, the design stance involves understanding systems in terms of their function and purpose, whereas behaviorists specifically focused on mechanical stimulus-response processes without regard to mental states or purposes, which is characteristic of the physical stance.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

Levels of analysis: Evolutionary psychologists find the Design stance most suitable for analysis. Their main interest lies in understanding why specific cognitive behaviors exist, which is best approached by examining how psychological designs have evolved across time and cultures. This understanding cannot be achieved solely by focusing on the physical aspects or by interpreting the intentions behind historical changes; instead, the tangible modifications in design can be observed and analyzed.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance and provides appropriate reasoning. They explain that evolutionary psychologists are interested in understanding 'why specific cognitive behaviors exist' and examine 'how psychological designs have evolved,' which aligns with the functional perspective that characterizes the design stance. The answer demonstrates understanding that this approach focuses on the function/purpose of psychological processes rather than just physical mechanisms or intentional explanations.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Distinct: events A and B can be identified separately. Common sense causality: based on natural clinical intuition, it is reasonable to think that A leads to B. Time and Place: for A to cause B, both must occur at the same time and location (e.g., petting your cat won't cause other cats to purr). Causal: event A happens before event B.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: Student mentions 'Distinct' but defines it as events being identifiable separately, missing the key concept that B should follow A but not other events (specificity).
- Incorrect: Student does not mention consistency - the heuristic that B should always follow A.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies 'Common sense causality' which matches the plausibility heuristic from the answer key.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies 'Time and Place' heuristic, understanding that A and B must occur at the same time and location, with a good example.
- Incorrect: Student does not mention similarity in cause and effect. The 'Causal' point about temporal order is important but not one of the five specific heuristics listed in the answer key.

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Negativity Bias: People tend to focus more on negative information and give it greater importance in their judgments. When this is paired with the availability heuristic, it helps explain why such overestimations occur. Content that is more divisive and provocative tends to be prioritized, so even if the actual amount of morally outraging content is low, users are exposed to a disproportionate amount. As a result, they rely on this readily available information to form assumptions, leading to an exaggerated perception of how many people are morally outraged.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias and explains it as people focusing more on negative information and giving it greater importance in judgments, which aligns with the answer key's definition.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the availability heuristic and explains how readily available information leads to assumptions about frequency, which matches the answer key's concept of estimating based on ease of recall.
- Correct: The student effectively explains the interaction between both biases - how negativity bias causes exposure to disproportionate amounts of outraged content, which then through availability heuristic leads to overestimation of moral outrage frequency.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

Your understanding of the person you strongly dislike will tend to carry a predominantly negative view of the elements within that understanding to support your dislike. As a result, anything associated with this negative framework is likely to be perceived negatively as well. This pattern of thought helps explain and reinforce your reasons for disliking them (causal model).

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student discusses causal models and negative associations but does not identify the key concept of biological contagion being incorrectly applied to the social/psychological domain, which is the core framework theory explanation requested.

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

Evidence. If individuals can track the rationale behind their beliefs and proceed through a logical sequence by examining evidence impartially without jumping to early conclusions.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student focuses on evidence and logical reasoning but misses the key distinction in the answer key: that delusional conspiracy theories are both irrational beliefs AND not commonly accepted, while the student only addresses the rationality aspect without mentioning social acceptance as a criterion.

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

Narcissism involves an absence of logical, focused thinking and is typically seen in males (can now be considered a cognitive or personality trait, correct?).

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies narcissism as a factor contributing to conspiratorial thinking, which matches the answer key.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies being male as a factor contributing to conspiratorial thinking, which is listed in the answer key.
- Incorrect: Student only provides two factors (narcissism and being male) when the question asks for three factors, and doesn't clearly identify a third distinct factor from the answer key.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Anchoring can hinder learning in this situation. The initial exposure to information forms a strong initial impression, which is later modified as you continue learning. However, this initial anchor tends to have a greater influence than the subsequent adjustments, causing difficulties in the learning process, especially if the first information encountered includes incorrect answers on a test.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes anchoring bias, which refers to over-relying on initial information when making decisions. However, this doesn't address the specific mechanism by which incorrect answers interfere with learning. The answer key requires explanation of source amnesia (forgetting that an answer was incorrect), proactive interference (old incorrect information interfering with new correct information), or the continued-influence effect. Anchoring is not the relevant psychological mechanism for this particular learning interference scenario.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

The more often we encounter certain information, the more inclined we become to believe it is true. This process is sometimes referred to as indoctrination, which involves forcibly instilling a set of beliefs or ideas.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes the illusory-truth effect (believing repeated information is more true) but incorrectly labels it as 'indoctrination' and focuses on belief rather than preference/attractiveness. They miss the key concept of mere exposure effect, which is about familiarity breeding preference, not truth evaluation.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

This question is challenging to answer without clearer definitions. Individuals with major depressive disorder tend to make more negative predictions about their future, which can lead to lower accuracy. However, if a depressed person predicts that they will remain incapable of functioning and continue to be depressed for years, they might end up fulfilling that prediction, making it accurate. Nonetheless, within the scope of this course, the expected answer is that they are less accurate because of a stronger negativity bias.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that people with major depressive disorder are less accurate due to negativity bias, when the answer key indicates they are actually more accurate because they show reduced optimism bias (depressive realism). The student acknowledges this might be the 'expected answer' but still provides the opposite of what the research shows.

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

When the trustworthiness of your sensory input diminishes, your existing beliefs have a greater impact on your decisions. For instance, if a person loses their sight, they will depend more on their mental map of their home than on visual cues to navigate.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when sensory information becomes less reliable (described as 'trustworthiness diminishes'), prior beliefs have greater influence on perception/decisions. The example of a person losing sight and relying more on their mental map effectively illustrates how decreased sensory reliability leads to increased reliance on prior knowledge/expectations.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

1. Acting out of self-interest 2. Mimicking ethical actions to gain social acceptance 3. Grasping the rationale and significance behind moral conduct

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the pre-conventional level as acting out of self-interest, which aligns with the focus on avoiding punishment or gaining rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as mimicking ethical actions for social acceptance, which matches the focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly captures the post-conventional level as grasping the rationale behind moral conduct, which corresponds to focusing on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model represents the cause-and-effect relationships we construct to organize and interpret past events or decisions. It leads to hindsight bias by making us believe that we relied on such a model when making past choices, even though those decisions were likely made without a clear causal basis.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a causal model represents cause-and-effect relationships used to organize and interpret past events, which aligns with the answer key's definition of a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Incorrect: The student's explanation of how causal models contribute to hindsight bias focuses on false memories of using causal reasoning in past decisions, rather than the key mechanism that events in causal models seem more inevitable than they actually were.

Score: 0.5

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Learning fosters hindsight bias because the insights gained from an experience make you feel as though you always knew the outcome. Often referred to as the curse of knowledge, it becomes difficult to separate your past perspective from your current understanding, causing your present knowledge to influence how you interpret earlier decisions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly explains that learning contributes to hindsight bias by making it difficult to separate current knowledge from past perspective when estimating previous judgments. They also correctly identify this phenomenon as the 'curse of knowledge' and accurately describe how newly acquired information inevitably influences recollections of past likelihood estimates.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

A person with a maximizing decision style aims to get the greatest satisfaction from every set of choices. Individuals who score high in neuroticism are often inclined to make decisions this way. On the other hand, satisficing involves being content with a decision that meets acceptable criteria; it’s not essential to choose the best option, as long as the choice is good enough for this approach.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

I believe it's important to take into account the students' pre-existing knowledge when teaching a class like this, and using an AI language model—not a rule-based one—can help assess how well new information is integrated. GPT-3 allows for evaluating a student's thought process instead of just memorizing fixed rules. While this approach may introduce more ambiguity, I find it somewhat frustrating that there is little chance to apply my current understanding of psychology in the exam, as I worry I might miss questions based on strict rules.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement with the question by discussing the use of AI language models for assessment, considering the balance between evaluating thought processes versus memorization, and reflecting on the challenges of rule-based versus more flexible evaluation methods. They also show metacognitive awareness about their own learning experience and concerns about assessment formats.
