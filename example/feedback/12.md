## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidtâ€™s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

System 1 is responsible for fast, instinctive moral judgments, while system 2 handles more complex moral choices that need careful consideration and reflection. The social-intuitionist model suggests that system 1 plays a more influential role.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 involves fast, instinctive moral judgments, which aligns with the answer key's description of System 1 as intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student accurately describes System 2 as handling complex moral choices requiring careful consideration and reflection, which matches the answer key's definition of System 2 as reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student correctly states that System 1 plays a more influential role, which corresponds to the answer key's point that System 1 thinking is more dominant than System 2 thinking.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

The representativeness heuristic involves estimating the likelihood that someone is part of a group by how similar they appear to typical members or the stereotypes associated with that group.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process in this scenario.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that the representativeness heuristic involves estimating likelihood of category membership based on similarity to typical members or stereotypes of that group, which matches the key concept in the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring refers to assigning a specific value to something, which then influences how people perceive related information. The primacy effect means that the initial information encountered is more easily remembered. Both concepts share the idea that the first piece of information a person receives holds greater importance than the information that comes later.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as involving the first piece of information influencing perception, which aligns with the answer key's description of taking the first information as a starting point.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as initial information being more easily remembered, which matches the answer key's definition of better remembering the first piece of information.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both concepts involve the first piece of information holding greater importance, which corresponds to the answer key's point about overreliance on first information.

Score: 1.0

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over acquiring equivalent gains. In contrast, risk aversion is less consistent and varies based on the individual and the possibility of losing something, which tends to increase the level of risk aversion.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines loss aversion as the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over acquiring equivalent gains, which matches the answer key's definition.
- Incorrect: The student's definition of risk aversion is incomplete and confused. They mention it varies by individual and relates to losing something, but fail to identify the core concept that risk aversion is the preference for certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 0.5

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias is a cognitive tendency where individuals overestimate or misjudge the true effect their choices will have. As a result, someone in an unhappy relationship experiencing impact bias may undervalue how much ending the relationship would actually improve their happiness.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies impact bias as overestimating or misjudging the effect of future events, which aligns with the answer key's definition of overestimating the impact of future events on our feelings.
- Incorrect: The student suggests impact bias causes people to undervalue how much ending the relationship would improve their happiness, but the answer key indicates people overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel - these are opposite mechanisms.

Score: 0.5

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves anticipating your emotional reactions to future events. This is crucial in end-of-life decisions, as thoughtfully considering these feelings might change a person's choices.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies affective forecasting as anticipating emotional reactions to future events, which aligns with the answer key's definition of predictions about future emotional states.
- Incorrect: The student mentions that considering feelings might change choices but misses the key insight that healthy people may predict preferring death when sick, but actually prefer to live when they become ill.

Score: 0.5

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

People often overrate small probabilities, causing them to consider such events as impossible. This perception is similar for both moderately low and extremely low probabilities because individuals usually think in absolute terms rather than in statistical concepts like percentages.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that people overrate small probabilities and consider them impossible, which is contradictory. The answer key indicates that merely low probabilities are overestimated (given too much weight), not considered impossible.
- Incorrect: The student claims there is no difference between moderately low and extremely low probabilities, stating both are treated similarly. However, the answer key distinguishes between these: merely low probabilities are overestimated while extremely low probabilities are treated as impossibilities.

Score: 0.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion is seen as psychologically burdensome, resulting in a negative value according to prospect theory.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's answer does not correctly explain loss aversion in terms of utility. The answer mentions psychological burden and negative value but fails to capture the key concept that loss aversion means negative utilities (losses) are weighted more heavily than positive utilities (gains) of the same magnitude, or that the value function is steeper for losses than gains.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory applies solely to financial contexts, whereas expected utility theory extends to non-financial scenarios as well. Additionally, expected utility theory takes into account heuristics and biases, which expected value theory does not address.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory deals only with financial contexts while expected utility theory extends to non-financial scenarios, which matches the first point in the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student states that expected utility theory considers heuristics and biases, but the answer key specifies that expected utility theory considers risk aversion, not heuristics and biases in general.

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesnâ€™t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected value theory is a prescriptive framework for making financial decisions. Expected utility theory serves as a largely prescriptive model for decisions involving both financial and non-financial aspects, incorporating heuristics and biases, with each alternative assigned a specific utility. Multi-attribute utility theory evaluates choices based on multiple attributes, each possessing its own utility. Prospect theory is a descriptive model that takes into account actual human behavior.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as a prescriptive/normative model for financial decisions, capturing the key essence of the theory.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that expected utility theory incorporates heuristics and biases, which is actually a characteristic of prospect theory, not expected utility theory.
- Incorrect: The student mentions multiple attributes and utilities but fails to mention the crucial concept of weights for each attribute, which is a key component of multi-attribute utility theory.
- Incorrect: While the student correctly identifies prospect theory as descriptive and focused on human behavior, they fail to mention its similarity to expected utility theory or its specific focus on heuristics and biases.

Score: 0.25

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease peopleâ€™s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Individuals usually favor preventing the loss of something they possess over attempting to acquire something new. Since losing is seen as more threatening, loss aversion typically causes people to be more cautious about taking risks.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that loss aversion makes people more risk averse and cautious. The answer key indicates the opposite - that loss aversion can actually decrease risk aversion and make people risk-seeking when trying to avoid potential losses.

Score: 0.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves learning by means of stimuli. Classical conditioning occurs when a stimulus is linked to an existing behavior that happens simultaneously. In contrast, operant conditioning uses a stimulus to encourage the development of a new behavior.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as a form of learning, though they describe it in terms of stimuli rather than associations through covariation. This shows understanding of the basic concept.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of classical conditioning by explaining that a stimulus becomes linked to an existing behavior when they occur simultaneously, which captures the essence of learning associations through temporal contiguity.
- Correct: The student correctly distinguishes operant conditioning as involving stimuli that encourage new behaviors, which aligns with the concept of learning that actions cause consequences (rewards or punishments).

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation and illusory correlation differ in that illusory causation specifically involves a perceived cause-and-effect relationship.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student only partially addresses the difference by mentioning that illusory causation involves perceived cause-and-effect relationships, but fails to explain what illusory correlation is or provide the key distinction that illusory causation misinterprets existing correlations as causal while illusory correlation perceives correlations that don't actually exist.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to â€˜properlyâ€™ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

Grasping the Dutch healthcare system involves a schema, which is a framework of behavioral guidelines for a particular task. In contrast, knowing how a Dutch birthday party operates is a scriptâ€”a more detailed and culturally shaped set of rules for highly habitual actions, such as attending that specific type of birthday celebration.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly defines schema as 'behavioral guidelines for a particular task' when it should be about knowledge structures and relationships between concepts. However, they correctly identify the healthcare system as a schema.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies birthday party behavior as a script and provides an appropriate explanation that it involves culturally shaped rules for specific situational behavior.

Score: 0.5

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

Behaviorists embraced Dennett's physical stance because they aimed to assess an individual's physical characteristics, specifically their responses to stimuli, in order to examine behavior.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that behaviorists adopted the physical stance and provides appropriate reasoning - they focused on observable physical responses (behaviors) to stimuli rather than internal mental processes, which aligns with the behaviorist emphasis on measurable, objective phenomena.

Score: 1.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

Evolutionary psychologists use Dennett's mental stance (the non-physical perspective), which involves attributing thoughts and intentions to individuals in order to explain their behavior. This approach is precisely why they chose to adopt this perspective.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the intentional stance (referred to as 'mental stance') rather than the design stance. While evolutionary psychology does consider mental processes, it primarily focuses on the functional design and adaptive purpose of psychological mechanisms, which aligns with the design stance that explains phenomena in terms of their function and purpose.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Proximity in time and location, similarity rule of thumb, consistency rule of thumb, ease of recall rule of thumb, typicality rule of thumb

Feedback:

- Correct: Student mentions 'proximity in time and location' which corresponds to contiguity in time and space from the answer key.
- Correct: Student mentions 'consistency rule of thumb' which matches the consistency heuristic from the answer key.
- Incorrect: Student mentions 'ease of recall rule of thumb' which is not one of the five heuristics for judging causation vs correlation.
- Incorrect: Student mentions 'typicality rule of thumb' which is not one of the five heuristics for judging causation vs correlation.
- Incorrect: Student does not mention distinctness/specificity or plausibility heuristics, and 'similarity rule of thumb' is unclear and lacks explanation - only identifies 2 out of 5 required heuristics.

Score: 0.4

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

The negativity bias means we are drawn to emotional content, while the correspondence bias involves wrongly attributing events to a person's character, ignoring other factors. Combined, these biases cause people to overestimate how many individuals are emotionally upset, believing that those sharing negative content online are the direct cause.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias and accurately describes it as being drawn to emotional/negative content, which aligns with the answer key's description of seeking out or placing more weight on negative information.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies correspondence bias instead of availability heuristic. Correspondence bias relates to attributing behavior to character rather than situation, which is not the cognitive mechanism described in the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student's explanation of how the biases work together is incorrect. They describe correspondence bias causing attribution to character rather than the availability heuristic mechanism where increased exposure to negative content makes it seem more frequent than it actually is.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

An item that once belonged to someone you deeply dislike is perceived as linked to that individual. Regardless of any efforts made to cleanse or purify it afterward, using that item will still feel unpleasant to you, even though it was never truly tainted.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that the concept of contagion (items retaining properties from previous contact) is being applied from the biological domain to the social/psychological domain, demonstrating understanding of cross-domain framework theory application.

Score: 1.0

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A delusional conspiracy theory is based on a strong distrust of science and authority, while a non-delusional conspiracy theory is more accepting of scientific perspectives.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the distinction as being about trust in science and authority, rather than the correct criteria of irrationality combined with lack of common acceptance versus rational beliefs or commonly accepted theories.

Score: 0.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

One factor is 'agreeableness' from the Big Five personality traits, where individuals with conspiratorial thinking often have low scores. Additionally, these individuals frequently exhibit a strong correspondence bias. Lastly, they tend to have low levels of the personality trait 'openness to experience.'

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions 'agreeableness' from Big Five traits, but this is not listed in the answer key. The answer key does not include agreeableness as one of the factors contributing to conspiratorial thinking.
- Incorrect: The student mentions 'correspondence bias' which is not included in the answer key factors. This does not match any of the cognitive or personality factors specified in the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student mentions 'low openness to experience' which is not listed in the answer key. The answer key does not include openness to experience as one of the contributing factors to conspiratorial thinking.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you donâ€™t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

This can be affected by the availability heuristic.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions availability heuristic, which is about judging probability based on how easily examples come to mind, but this doesn't explain how incorrect answers interfere with learning. The answer key requires explanation of source amnesia, proactive interference, or continued-influence effect - mechanisms where incorrect answers are later mistaken for correct ones or interfere with correct information.

Score: 0.0

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

By means of the mere exposure effect.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the mere exposure effect as the psychological mechanism, which matches the answer key's description of mere exposure as the tendency to prefer things we are familiar with.

Score: 1.0

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Yes, it reduces their accuracy in making these predictions.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that major depressive disorder reduces accuracy in predictions, when the answer key indicates that people with depression are actually MORE accurate due to reduced optimism bias.

Score: 0.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

The impact of those previous beliefs grows because you can no longer depend as much on your sensory input.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that prior beliefs have greater influence when sensory information becomes less reliable, demonstrating understanding of the inverse relationship between sensory reliability and prior belief influence in the ideal-observer model.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You donâ€™t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other peopleâ€™s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

The three stages of moral development include 'determining,' where you choose which moral principles matter to you overall; 'valuating,' where you assign significance to each of those principles; and 'reflecting,' where you consider which ones hold the greatest personal importance.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes 'determining' as choosing moral principles, but this doesn't match the pre-conventional level which focuses on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Incorrect: The student describes 'valuating' as assigning significance to principles, but this doesn't match the conventional level which focuses on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Incorrect: The student describes 'reflecting' as considering personal importance of principles, but this doesn't match the post-conventional level which focuses on abstract principles and values, and the student's description is more about personal preference than universal abstract principles.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model of past events occurs when individuals exaggerate how much their previous choices have influenced the current situation. This intensifies hindsight bias by causing people to overvalue their past decisions.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly defines a causal model as exaggerating personal influence on outcomes, rather than understanding it as a coherent narrative explaining how past events are related.
- Incorrect: The student describes overvaluing past decisions rather than explaining how causal models make events seem more inevitable than they actually were, which is the key mechanism of hindsight bias.

Score: 0.0

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Newly acquired information often has a strong impact on your choices, and when paired with hindsight bias, it causes individuals to be less convinced that they 'knew it all along,' thereby reducing the influence of hindsight bias.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that newly acquired information reduces hindsight bias, when in fact the answer key indicates that newly learned information cannot be avoided when estimating past likelihood judgments, which actually contributes to and increases hindsight bias rather than reducing it.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing involves seeking the optimal choice, while satisficing means looking for an option that meets acceptable criteria. Because pursuing perfection can lead to anxiety and other negative emotions, individuals with high levels of neuroticism are more prone to use a maximizing approach.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as seeking the optimal choice, which aligns with 'trying to make the best choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as looking for an option that meets acceptable criteria, which corresponds well with 'making a good-enough choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that individuals high in neuroticism are more prone to use a maximizing approach, matching the answer key's expectation.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

I would begin by having the students complete an interactive assignment. Although it might feel imposed, I think this method is highly educational and helps them engage with the content, preparing them effectively for the exam. For the exam itself, I would likely use a format similar to this one, featuring short answer open questions. This type of exam encourages students to study the material differently than they would for a multiple-choice test, requiring them to understand and articulate how various aspects of the content are connected or distinct.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement with the question by proposing concrete strategies (interactive assignments and short answer questions) and explaining the pedagogical reasoning behind these choices. They show understanding of how different assessment formats influence student learning behavior and engagement with material.
