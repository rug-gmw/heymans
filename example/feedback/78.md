## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

In the intuitionist model, System 1 plays a larger role because it depends heavily on heuristics and biases to make decisions based on instinctive "gut feelings."

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions System 1 but does not clearly define it as intuitions or emotions in the context of Haidt's model.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention or define System 2 thinking as reasoning, rational thought, or deliberation.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 plays a larger role, indicating it is more dominant than System 2.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

We tend to think that more people are models than they really are, which can be explained by the availability heuristic since we frequently see attractive individuals in the media.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the availability heuristic instead of the representativeness heuristic as the underlying mechanism for this assumption.
- Incorrect: The student does not explain the representativeness heuristic concept of estimating likelihood based on resemblance to stereotypes, instead discussing frequency of exposure through media.

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

The primacy effect happens when information shown first is remembered more effectively since it has a longer opportunity for rehearsal. Anchoring involves using the initial information as a reference point, influencing how subsequent information is understood. Both concepts can be observed in the significance of first impressions when meeting someone new, where the first impression acts as the anchor.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as using initial information as a reference point that influences how subsequent information is understood, which aligns with the answer key's definition of taking the first piece of information as the starting point.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as information shown first being remembered more effectively, which matches the answer key's point about better remembering the first piece of information.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of what both concepts have in common by explaining how first impressions serve as anchors, showing they recognize both involve overreliance on first information, though they illustrate this through example rather than stating it directly.

Score: 1.0

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion is the tendency for individuals to steer clear of choices that could result in a loss. Risk aversion is the preference for safe options over risky ones, leading people to avoid uncertain decisions.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes loss aversion as avoiding choices that could result in loss, but misses the key concept that losses are weighted more heavily than equivalent gains. The definition lacks the comparative aspect between losses and gains.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies risk aversion as preferring safe options over risky ones and avoiding uncertain decisions, which aligns with the preference for certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 0.5

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

People often exaggerate the effect that a future event will have on their feelings and life. For example, when individuals are unhappy in a relationship, they hesitate to end it because they believe it will "destroy their lives" or that they "won't be able to bounce back."

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies impact bias as exaggerating the effect of future events on feelings, which matches the answer key's definition of overestimating the impact of future events on future feelings.
- Correct: The student provides a clear example showing how impact bias prevents breakups by explaining that people hesitate to end relationships because they overestimate the negative consequences ('destroy their lives', 'won't bounce back'), which aligns with the answer key's point about overestimating how bad a breakup will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting refers to how individuals anticipate the emotional effects of future events. When facing end-of-life decisions, the fear of death can be so intense that people deny it entirely because it triggers unpleasant feelings. Consequently, they may make illogical decisions based on plans for a future that does not exist.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies affective forecasting as predictions about future emotional states, though they phrase it as 'anticipate the emotional effects of future events' which captures the same concept.
- Incorrect: The student does not address the key point about healthy people predicting they would prefer to die when sick, but then changing their preference when actually ill. Instead, they focus on denial of death due to fear, which is not the main issue described in the answer key.

Score: 0.5

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

Prospect theory suggests that people tend to undervalue low probabilities. They perceive moderately low probabilities as more likely to occur than they truly are, yet they view extremely low probabilities as if they cannot happen at all.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student states people 'undervalue low probabilities' and then says they perceive them as 'more likely to occur than they truly are,' which is contradictory. The correct answer is that merely low probabilities are overestimated, not undervalued.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that extremely low probabilities are viewed 'as if they cannot happen at all,' which aligns with the answer key point that they are interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 0.5

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency of individuals to steer clear of experiences or outcomes that result in a negative value or loss.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes loss aversion as avoiding negative outcomes, but fails to capture the key utility concept that losses are weighted more heavily than equivalent gains, or that the value function is steeper for losses than gains.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory suggests that individuals choose based on the anticipated value of the result. In contrast, expected utility theory proposes that people decide based on the expected usefulness or satisfaction derived from the outcome.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student explains the general difference between value and utility but doesn't specifically address that expected value theory deals only with financial values while expected utility theory deals with both financial and non-financial values.
- Incorrect: The student doesn't mention risk aversion or heuristics and biases. They only describe utility as 'usefulness or satisfaction' without addressing the key behavioral aspects that distinguish expected utility theory.

Score: 0.0

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Prospect theory suggests that individuals base their decisions on expected utility, influenced by mental shortcuts and biases.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student does not mention expected value theory at all, which is a key model from the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention expected utility theory at all, which is a key model from the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention multi-attribute utility theory at all, which is a key model from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies prospect theory as being influenced by mental shortcuts and biases, which aligns with it being a descriptive behavioral model that considers heuristics and biases.

Score: 0.25

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Loss aversion generally affects people more strongly. In an effort to prevent losses, individuals are often willing to take greater risks, becoming more risk-seeking out of desperation to avoid losing.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion leads people to become more risk-seeking when trying to avoid losses, which directly addresses how loss aversion can decrease risk aversion and make people willing to accept greater risks.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves understanding the environment by recognizing relationships and using them to anticipate what will happen next. In classical conditioning, two stimuli that occur together become linked. In operant conditioning, learning happens through observing the consequences, such as rewards or punishments, connected to a stimulus.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as learning about relationships/associations in the environment, which aligns with the key concept of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as linking two stimuli that occur together, which matches the answer key's description of learning to associate things that happen together in time and space.
- Incorrect: The student describes operant conditioning as learning through consequences connected to a stimulus, but misses the key point that it's specifically about learning that actions cause rewards or punishments - the focus should be on actions/behaviors, not stimuli.

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation describes a situation where two factors are correlated, but this link is incorrectly interpreted as one causing the other. Illusory correlation, on the other hand, involves perceiving a connection between factors when no actual relationship exists.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that illusory causation involves misinterpreting correlation as causation, and that illusory correlation involves perceiving a relationship where none actually exists. The explanation accurately captures both concepts and their key distinction.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

The Dutch healthcare system serves as an example of a schema because it represents a general framework of concepts about how the system operates, while the birthday party example is a script since it relates to a particular event—a birthday—and involves guidelines for behavior and related actions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the Dutch healthcare system as a schema and provides an accurate explanation that it represents a general framework of concepts about how the system operates, which aligns with schemas being knowledge structures about relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the birthday party example as a script and accurately explains that it involves guidelines for behavior and actions in a particular event/situation, which matches the definition of scripts as social schemas for specific behavioral contexts.

Score: 1.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

In this case, behaviorists adopted a tangible perspective, focusing solely on observable stimuli and responses, without considering underlying factors.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly identifies that behaviorists focused on observable stimuli and responses, but they use 'tangible perspective' instead of the correct 'physical stance' from Dennett's framework. Additionally, they don't adequately explain that behaviorists focused on the causal processes between stimulus and behavior, which is the key reason for adopting the physical stance.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

In this context, they adopt a utility or functionality perspective, focusing on how a specific process benefits evolution.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly identifies that evolutionary psychologists focus on functionality and how processes benefit evolution, but fails to specifically identify Dennett's 'design stance' as the level of analysis being adopted, which is the key concept the question is asking about.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Temporal precedence refers to whether event A occurs before event B. Realisticness considers if it is plausible for a connection between A and B to exist. Consistency examines if event B consistently follows event A. Specificity looks at whether event B happens exclusively after event A and not in other circumstances.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: Student mentions 'specificity' which relates to distinctness, but doesn't capture the full concept that B should not follow other events besides A.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies consistency as B consistently following A, matching the answer key.
- Correct: Student mentions 'realisticness' which correctly corresponds to plausibility - whether it makes sense that A causes B.
- Incorrect: Student mentions 'temporal precedence' (A before B) but the answer key requires contiguity in time AND space (same time and location).
- Incorrect: Student does not mention similarity in cause and effect as a heuristic for judging causation.

Score: 0.4

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Social media algorithms often cluster users and foster echo chambers, making extreme opinions appear more common than they truly are. Additionally, confirmation bias may contribute, as individuals prone to moral outrage are more likely to search for or focus on morally provocative content.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student does not identify the negativity bias. Instead, they discuss social media algorithms and echo chambers, which is not the same as the tendency to seek out or place more weight on negative information.
- Incorrect: The student does not identify the availability heuristic. They mention confirmation bias instead, which is different from estimating frequency based on ease of recall of examples.
- Incorrect: The student does not explain the connection between negativity bias and availability heuristic as described in the answer key. Their explanation focuses on algorithms and confirmation bias rather than how negativity bias increases accessible examples for the availability heuristic.

Score: 0.0

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

Magical contagion involves taking knowledge from one field and applying it to a completely different and unrelated area. For example, understanding that viruses spread in biology is transferred to a social context, where people think that someone's negative attitude can also be "contagious."

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that magical contagion involves applying biological concepts (like virus transmission) to social/psychological domains where they don't actually apply, which matches the answer key's point about incorrectly applying contagion from the biological domain to the social domain.

Score: 1.0

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A non-delusional conspiracy is one that is commonly believed and broadly accepted within society, whereas a delusional conspiracy is considered unusual, extreme, and generally rejected by the public.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student only addresses the 'commonly accepted' criterion but fails to mention the 'irrational belief' component that is essential for distinguishing delusional from non-delusional conspiracy theories according to the answer key.

Score: 0.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

Populism involves a tendency to trust in superstitions and a general naivety, with individuals who are easily deceived. It often includes minorities or those who feel marginalized in society, particularly those who believe the elite intend to harm them. It also encompasses a belief in supernatural occurrences.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student discusses populism rather than cognitive/personality factors contributing to conspiratorial thinking. While they mention superstitions and supernatural beliefs, these don't directly match the specific factors from the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student focuses on demographic characteristics (minorities, marginalized groups) and general social dynamics rather than the specific cognitive factors like pattern recognition in randomness or analytical thinking deficits mentioned in the answer key.
- Correct: The student mentions 'belief in supernatural occurrences' which aligns with 'believing paranormal phenomena' from the answer key, demonstrating understanding of at least one relevant factor.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Context amnesia occurs when individuals forget the circumstances under which they acquired information, leading them to mistakenly accept it as absolute truth.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes 'context amnesia' which is not the correct psychological mechanism. The answer key requires 'source amnesia' - forgetting that an answer was incorrect and mistaking it for correct. Context amnesia refers to forgetting circumstances of information acquisition, which is different from the specific mechanism of forgetting the accuracy status of one's own answers.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

They also aim for people to forget the source of a mistaken fact over time, leading them to accept it as true.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes source monitoring errors or the sleeper effect, but does not identify the correct psychological mechanism. The answer key requires identifying mere exposure effect (tendency to prefer familiar things) or illusory-truth effect (repeated statements seem more true), neither of which the student mentioned.

Score: 0.0

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Individuals with MDD tend to make less accurate predictions because their existing negative mood leads them to expect negative outcomes, causing them to believe that many potential events will harm them and worsen their feelings.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that people with MDD are less accurate at predictions due to negative bias, when the answer key indicates they are actually more accurate because they show reduced optimism bias compared to non-depressed individuals.

Score: 0.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

As sensory information becomes less reliable, prior beliefs play a greater role in shaping perception. For example, if a stimulus is seen only briefly and the individual is unsure of what it was, they are more likely to perceive it based on their own expectations.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that prior beliefs have greater influence on perception when sensory information is less reliable, and provides a relevant example demonstrating this principle.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

Pre-conventional: moral behavior is influenced by the desire to avoid punishment and gain rewards. Conventional: moral behavior is shaped by societal norms, rules, and the impact of our actions on others. Post-conventional: moral behavior is directed by personal, fundamental principles about how we ought to act and think.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the pre-conventional level as being motivated by avoiding punishment and gaining rewards, which matches the answer key's focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as being shaped by societal norms, rules, and consideration of impact on others, which aligns with the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the post-conventional level as being directed by personal, fundamental principles about how we ought to act, which matches the answer key's focus on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

People often believe that when one event follows another, the first event caused the second. To avoid confronting an unfavorable result, individuals usually persuade themselves that the outcome was more foreseeable than it truly was, convincing themselves they anticipated it.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes post hoc reasoning (assuming causation from sequence) but does not define a causal model as a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student correctly explains how people convince themselves outcomes were more foreseeable than they actually were, which captures the essence of how causal models contribute to hindsight bias.

Score: 0.5

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

After acquiring new information, individuals will reinterpret all previous information based on this new knowledge. As a result, they will think the outcome was foreseeable all along, even though it actually occurred by chance.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that newly acquired information influences how people evaluate past events, making outcomes seem more predictable in retrospect. This demonstrates understanding of how learning contributes to hindsight bias by showing that new knowledge cannot be ignored when making retrospective judgments.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing involves choosing an option that results in the optimal outcome, whereas satisficing involves selecting a decision that is good enough and uses minimal resources. Individuals with high levels of neuroticism tend to prefer a maximizing approach to decision-making.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as choosing an option that results in the optimal outcome, which aligns with 'trying to make the best choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as selecting a decision that is 'good enough,' which matches the answer key's definition of 'making a good-enough choice.' The additional detail about using minimal resources is relevant and correct.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that individuals with high neuroticism tend to prefer a maximizing approach, which directly matches the answer key's statement about adopting the maximizing decision style.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

In my view, using AI to grade exams is a great initial step. Since AI can quickly determine the correctness of answers, it lessens the professor’s workload while still preserving the advantages of open-ended questions. Another option might be to add a practical component to the course, like the assignment we completed, but with an added presentation in a group setting. Although this could require more resources, incorporating a practical session would enhance the course by giving everyone the chance to showcase their project, preventing it from feeling pointless.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement by proposing concrete solutions: using AI for grading to maintain open-ended questions while reducing workload, and adding practical components with group presentations. They show awareness of resource constraints while thoughtfully considering trade-offs between efficiency and educational value.
