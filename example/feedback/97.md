## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

System 1 operates quickly, driven by emotions and intuition. In contrast, System 2 is slower, more thoughtful, and takes time to process. System 1 tends to dominate because it shapes our initial thoughts, and altering these thoughts demands effort.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 is driven by emotions and intuition, which aligns with the answer key's requirement that System 1 refers to intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student accurately describes System 2 as slower and more thoughtful, which corresponds to the answer key's definition of System 2 as reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student clearly states that 'System 1 tends to dominate' and explains that it shapes initial thoughts while changing them requires effort, demonstrating understanding that System 1 is more dominant than System 2.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

The representative heuristic means we tend to classify an object or person into a category if it closely matches the typical characteristics of that category.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying concept, though with a minor spelling variation ('representative' instead of 'representativeness').
- Correct: The student provides an accurate explanation of the representativeness heuristic, describing how we classify based on matching typical characteristics of a category, which aligns with the answer key's explanation about estimating likelihood based on resemblance to stereotypes.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring happens when an initial impression acts as a reference point, causing later information to be influenced by that first piece of data. The primacy effect refers to the first information received about something. Both concepts share the idea that the initial information, or primacy effect, becomes the anchor that shapes how subsequent details are evaluated.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as using initial information as a reference point that influences later evaluations, which aligns with the answer key's definition of taking the first piece of information as the starting point.
- Incorrect: The student describes the primacy effect as 'the first information received about something' but fails to mention the key aspect of better remembering this first information, which is the core of the primacy effect.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both concepts involve overreliance on initial/first information, stating that 'the initial information becomes the anchor that shapes how subsequent details are evaluated.'

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion means people tend to steer clear of scenarios where potential gains and losses are balanced because losses feel more significant than gains. Risk aversion, on the other hand, refers to the preference for certainty over uncertainty, leading individuals to avoid situations with unknown risks.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves weighing losses more heavily than gains, explaining that losses feel more significant than equivalent gains.
- Correct: The student accurately defines risk aversion as the preference for certainty over uncertainty and avoiding situations with unknown risks.

Score: 1.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias refers to our tendency to exaggerate how much our future actions will influence our emotions. This can lead people to stay in relationships they should leave because they believe the breakup will be far more painful than it actually would be, causing them to avoid ending the relationship.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies impact bias as the tendency to exaggerate/overestimate how future events (actions) will affect emotions, which matches the answer key's definition.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that impact bias prevents breakups because people overestimate the pain/negative feelings a breakup would cause, leading them to avoid ending unhappy relationships.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting refers to predicting how our future actions will influence our emotions later on. It's crucial in end-of-life decisions because people often exaggerate how negatively they'll feel if faced with a serious illness. As a result, once the illness occurs, their preferences may shift from their earlier stance on ending their life under such circumstances.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly defines affective forecasting as predicting how future actions will influence emotions, when it actually refers to predictions about our own future emotional states in general.
- Correct: The student correctly captures the key concept that healthy people may predict they'll want to die when sick, but their actual preferences may change once they become ill.

Score: 0.5

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

Prospect theory suggests that individuals tend to downplay low probabilities. However, there's a distinction: while low probabilities are generally underestimated, extremely low probabilities are often seen as impossible.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student states that low probabilities are 'generally underestimated' which contradicts the answer key that states merely low probabilities are 'often overestimated'.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that extremely low probabilities are often seen as impossible, which aligns with the answer key's point about them being 'interpreted as impossibilities'.

Score: 0.5

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion shows that people prefer to avoid losing something rather than gaining something of equal value, leading them to steer clear of scenarios where potential losses and gains are balanced.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes the behavioral concept of loss aversion correctly but fails to address the specific question about how this is expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory. The answer does not mention that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities or that the value function is steeper for losses than gains.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected utility theory considers both personal preferences and attitudes toward risk, not just financial outcomes measured in money. In contrast, expected value theory ignores these factors.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected utility theory considers more than just financial outcomes (personal preferences) while expected value theory focuses on monetary/financial measures, which aligns with the key point about financial vs non-financial values.
- Correct: The student correctly mentions that expected utility theory considers 'attitudes toward risk' while expected value theory 'ignores these factors,' which captures the essence of risk aversion being considered in expected utility theory but not in expected value theory.

Score: 1.0

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected value theory focuses solely on monetary outcomes, ignoring heuristics and biases, and assumes perfect knowledge of probabilities, making it poor at explaining human behavior. Expected utility theory considers non-monetary utilities but still assumes full probability awareness and fails to account for heuristics and biases, limiting its applicability to human behavior. Multi-attribute utility theory assigns weights to different attributes, making it useful for complex decisions, though it also overlooks heuristics and biases. Prospect theory, however, incorporates heuristics and biases, offering a descriptive model of how people make decisions, particularly in terms of gains and losses.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as focusing on monetary outcomes and notes it assumes perfect knowledge of probabilities, which aligns with it being a normative model with financial outcomes and probabilities.
- Correct: The student accurately describes expected utility theory as considering non-monetary utilities while still assuming probability awareness, which matches the answer key's description of outcomes having subjective utility rather than just financial.
- Correct: The student correctly mentions that multi-attribute utility theory assigns weights to different attributes and is useful for complex decisions, which aligns with the answer key's description of multiple attributes with utilities and weights.
- Correct: The student accurately identifies prospect theory as incorporating heuristics and biases and being descriptive of how people actually make decisions, which matches the answer key's description of it being a descriptive behavioral model that considers heuristics and biases.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Loss aversion influences how risk-averse individuals are because people typically steer clear of scenarios where potential gains and losses are comparable. When their circumstances are stable, individuals usually become more loss-averse and avoid risks. However, if the situation is already unstable, they tend to take more risks since losses may occur even without any action.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion can make people risk-seeking when facing potential losses, particularly noting that in unstable situations people take more risks since losses may occur anyway. This captures the key concept that loss aversion decreases risk aversion and can lead to risk-seeking behavior in the domain of losses.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning refers to the process of learning to connect two things. In classical conditioning, it involves learning that a specific stimulus leads to a specific response. In operant conditioning, it involves learning that a certain action results in a particular consequence.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as a learning process involving connections/associations between elements, which aligns with the answer key's definition of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as learning that a stimulus leads to a response, which captures the essence of learning associations when things happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning that actions result in consequences, which matches the answer key's description of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation occurs when we mistakenly believe a stimulus causes a reaction, even though another factor might be responsible. Illusory correlation, on the other hand, happens when we falsely assume that two events consistently occur together.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly distinguishes between illusory causation (mistakenly believing one thing causes another when it doesn't) and illusory correlation (falsely perceiving that two events occur together when they don't actually correlate). While the wording differs from the answer key, the core conceptual understanding is accurate.

Score: 1.0

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

The Dutch healthcare system operates on a structured framework because it requires adherence to specific steps. Attending a Dutch birthday party involves following a social script, as it's a typical scenario with expected behaviors.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the healthcare system as operating on a 'structured framework' with 'specific steps' rather than recognizing it as a schema - knowledge and relationships between concepts. They confuse procedural aspects with the underlying cognitive structure.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies birthday party behavior as a script and provides appropriate reasoning - it's a 'typical scenario with expected behaviors' which aligns with the definition of a script as a social schema for specific situations.

Score: 0.5

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

They chose the design stance because they followed a process of cause and effect, similar to a machine's chain reaction that leads to a specific behavior.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the design stance instead of the physical stance. While they correctly understand that behaviorists focused on cause-and-effect processes, the design stance involves attributing purposes or goals to systems, whereas behaviorists specifically adopted the physical stance by treating organisms as physical systems responding mechanistically to stimuli.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

They do it on purpose by examining the behavior and the thought process that drives it.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student does not identify the design stance as the level of analysis used by evolutionary psychologists. While they mention examining behavior and thought processes, they fail to connect this to Dennett's specific framework of stances or explain that evolutionary psychologists focus on the functional/design aspects of psychological processes.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Events A and B must be clearly defined. B must occur whenever A occurs. It should be reasonable for B to result from A each time A happens. The relationship between A and B must hold consistently over time and space. Additionally, A and B should have a logical connection in terms of cause and effect.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions events must be 'clearly defined' but does not capture the distinctness/specificity heuristic, which is about B following A but not other events.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that 'B must occur whenever A occurs,' which captures the consistency heuristic.
- Correct: The student states 'it should be reasonable for B to result from A,' which adequately captures the plausibility heuristic.
- Correct: The student mentions the relationship must 'hold consistently over time and space,' which addresses the contiguity heuristic.
- Incorrect: The student mentions 'logical connection' but does not capture the similarity heuristic, which is about superficial resemblance between cause and effect.

Score: 0.6

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

The availability heuristic means we judge how likely something is based on how quickly we can think of examples. Confirmation bias happens when we believe a hypothesis is true just because we see a lot of supporting evidence, without checking if the hypothesis is too broad or narrow. Together, these biases lead to overestimation because the more moral outrage we encounter on social media, the more it sticks in our minds, making us seek out even more evidence that confirms our beliefs.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions confirmation bias instead of negativity bias. While confirmation bias involves seeking supporting evidence, the key point is that negativity bias specifically drives attention to negative/outraged content.
- Correct: The student correctly defines the availability heuristic as judging likelihood based on how easily examples come to mind, which matches the answer key definition.
- Incorrect: The student attempts to explain the interaction but uses confirmation bias rather than negativity bias. The mechanism described doesn't clearly show how negativity bias increases available examples of moral outrage for the availability heuristic.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

Framework theories are general, everyday beliefs about how the world operates. Magical contagion is a superstitious concept where events occur outside natural laws and aren't tied to religion. If you believe in this, you'll avoid using items from someone you dislike, fearing it will bring bad luck.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student explains what magical contagion is but fails to address the key concept from the answer key: that biological domain concepts (contagion) are being incorrectly applied to social/psychological domains. The student doesn't discuss framework theories for different domains of knowledge or explain the cross-domain transfer that creates this phenomenon.

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A delusional conspiracy theory lacks any supporting evidence, whereas a non-delusional one is backed by actual evidence.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student focuses only on evidence as the distinguishing factor, but misses the key criteria from the answer key: that a conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief AND not commonly accepted. The student's answer about evidence vs. no evidence doesn't capture the dual requirement of irrationality and lack of common acceptance.

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

The idea that supernatural occurrences provide straightforward answers to complicated situations and assign qualities to events that aren't actually present.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student mentions 'supernatural occurrences' which relates to believing in paranormal phenomena from the answer key.
- Correct: The phrase 'straightforward answers to complicated situations' directly corresponds to believing in simple explanations for complex events from the answer key.
- Correct: The phrase 'assign qualities to events that aren't actually present' accurately describes attributing agency where it does not exist from the answer key.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Memory source confusion.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the core mechanism as source confusion, which is essentially the same as source amnesia mentioned in the answer key - both refer to forgetting the source of information and potentially confusing incorrect answers with correct ones.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

The more you encounter something, the more you tend to like it—this is known as the mere exposure effect.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the mere exposure effect as the psychological mechanism, accurately describing it as the tendency to like things more when encountered frequently, which matches the answer key's definition of mere exposure as preferring familiar things.

Score: 1.0

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

People with major depressive disorder are actually better at predicting negative events because they don’t have the typical positivity bias that leads others to underestimate how often bad things occur. This bias is usually a sign of good mental health.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people with major depressive disorder are more accurate at predicting negative events due to reduced optimism bias, which aligns with the answer key's point about reduced overly optimistic tendencies making them more accurate.

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

When sensory data becomes less dependable, prior beliefs gain more influence. However, the actual perception of events will fall somewhere between the sensory input and those pre-existing beliefs.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that prior beliefs gain more influence when sensory data becomes less reliable, which directly matches the answer key. The additional detail about perception falling between sensory input and beliefs shows good understanding of the Bayesian integration process.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

Pre-conventional: Behavior is judged based on whether it leads to rewards or punishments. Conventional: Actions are considered right if they align with societal expectations and legal standards. Post-conventional: Recognizes that moral principles may sometimes clash with one another.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the pre-conventional level as focusing on rewards and punishments, which aligns with the answer key's description of obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as aligning with societal expectations and legal standards, which corresponds to the answer key's focus on social norms.
- Incorrect: The student's description of post-conventional level as recognizing that moral principles may clash is incomplete. The answer key requires describing the focus on abstract principles and values, which the student doesn't adequately capture.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model explains the reasons behind events as they unfolded. People often piece together a story of what actually occurred, but they don’t consider alternative outcomes, which fuels hindsight bias—the idea that the result was obvious all along.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a causal model explains reasons behind events and involves piecing together a story of what occurred, which aligns with the answer key's definition of a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student accurately connects causal models to hindsight bias by explaining that people don't consider alternative outcomes and instead view results as 'obvious all along,' which demonstrates understanding that events seem more inevitable than they were.

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Learning fuels hindsight bias because it's impossible to ignore new information we've acquired after making a decision when attempting to reassess what might have occurred.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that learning contributes to hindsight bias by making it impossible to ignore newly acquired information when reassessing past judgments, which directly aligns with the answer key's point about being unable to avoid taking newly learned information into account when estimating past likelihood judgments.

Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Seeking the best possible option is what maximizing is about, whereas satisficing involves settling for a choice that meets basic standards. People with high neuroticism tend to lean toward the maximizing approach.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as seeking the best possible option, which aligns with the answer key's definition of trying to make the best choice.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as settling for a choice that meets basic standards, which corresponds to the answer key's definition of making a good-enough choice.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people with high neuroticism tend to lean toward the maximizing approach, matching the answer key's statement about neurotic individuals adopting the maximizing decision style.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

There are two primary approaches to consider here. One option is to employ AI to give students feedback, though developing an effective AI that accurately assesses varied student responses—not just those matching lecture slides—would be complex and time-intensive. Alternatively, to boost engagement and provide feedback, students could be given either one open-ended question (limited to 100 words) per lecture or a set of 10 multiple-choice questions for grading. This would encourage students to stay engaged, knowing they have an assignment due before the next lecture. Additionally, this method would help them prepare for the final exam by familiarizing them with the types of questions to expect.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement by providing two concrete approaches: AI-assisted feedback and structured assignments (open-ended questions or multiple choice). They show understanding of practical constraints by acknowledging the complexity of AI development and proposing scalable solutions like word limits and multiple choice formats. The answer also connects to pedagogical goals by explaining how these methods would encourage engagement and exam preparation.
