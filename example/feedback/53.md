## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

Haidt's model suggests that our decisions are primarily driven by intuitions, which correspond to system 1. It also involves moral reasoning, where we consciously evaluate whether an intuition-based decision was right or wrong. This process is more deliberate and rational, aligning with system 2. According to the model, system 1 tends to have a stronger influence.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 corresponds to intuitions in Haidt's model.
- Correct: The student accurately describes System 2 as involving conscious, deliberate, and rational evaluation/reasoning processes.
- Correct: The student correctly states that System 1 has stronger influence/tends to be more dominant in Haidt's social-intuitionist model.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

The underlying heuristic is the representative heuristic, which involves judging that something or someone belongs to a certain category based on how closely they resemble typical members of that category.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying mechanism, though with a minor spelling variation ('representative' instead of 'representativeness').
- Correct: The student accurately explains that the heuristic involves judging category membership based on resemblance to typical members of that category, which captures the essence of stereotypical matching described in the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring refers to the tendency for the initial information received to act as a reference point for subsequent information. The primacy effect means that the first information encountered is considered more significant than what follows. Both biases involve the idea that early information holds more weight than information presented later.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as using initial information as a reference point, which aligns with the answer key's definition of taking the first piece of information as the starting point.
- Incorrect: The student describes the primacy effect as first information being 'more significant' rather than being 'better remembered,' which misses the memory-related aspect that is central to the primacy effect.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both biases involve early/first information holding more weight, which captures the essence of overreliance on first information.

Score: 0.6666666666666666

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

The distinction is that loss aversion means we feel losses more intensely than gains, while risk aversion means we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves feeling losses more intensely than gains, which captures the core concept of weighing losses more heavily than equivalent gains.
- Correct: The student accurately describes risk aversion as preferring certainty over uncertainty, which matches the answer key definition.

Score: 1.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate how much something will affect us. This can stop people from ending unhappy relationships because they believe the break-up will hurt them more than it actually does.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies impact bias as overestimating how much something will affect us, which captures the essence of overestimating the impact of future events on our feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly explains that impact bias prevents breakups because people overestimate how much the breakup will hurt them, which aligns with the answer key's point about overestimating how bad it will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves predicting how we will feel in the future. It is crucial to keep this in mind for end-of-life choices because people often misjudge their future emotions. We tend to assume that being disabled or ill will make us feel worse than we actually do when we experience these conditions later in life, a phenomenon known as the disability paradox.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines affective forecasting as predicting how we will feel in the future, which aligns with the answer key's definition of predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of the core concept by explaining that people misjudge future emotions and often assume disability/illness will be worse than actually experienced, which captures the essence of healthy people predicting they'd prefer to die when sick but not actually preferring this when they become sick.

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

According to prospect theory, individuals tend to overvalue low probabilities, with a distinction made between moderately low and extremely low probabilities.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that low probabilities are overvalued/overestimated according to prospect theory.
- Incorrect: The student mentions a distinction between moderately low and extremely low probabilities but fails to specify that extremely low probabilities are often treated as impossibilities rather than being overestimated.

Score: 0.5

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency to place greater importance on losses than on gains. As a result, losses provoke stronger negative emotions and lead to a greater decrease in overall satisfaction.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves placing greater importance on losses than gains, which captures the essence that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities in prospect theory.

Score: 1.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory operates by determining value purely in financial terms, whereas expected utility theory uses utility, which can extend beyond just monetary aspects. Additionally, expected utility theory considers risk aversion, while expected value theory does not.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory deals with financial/monetary terms while expected utility theory extends beyond financial aspects to include utility, which matches the answer key point about financial vs non-financial values.
- Correct: The student accurately states that expected utility theory considers risk aversion while expected value theory does not, which aligns with the answer key point about expected utility theory considering risk aversion versus expected value theory not considering heuristics and biases.

Score: 1.0

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected value theory is a normative approach that assists decision-making by calculating the value (solely in financial terms) and its probability. Expected utility theory, also normative, aids in decision-making by assessing utility alongside probability. Multiple attribute theory, another normative model, supports choices by evaluating the value and weighting of various attributes. Prospect theory, a descriptive model, guides decision-making based on utility and probability while considering heuristics and biases.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as a normative model that deals with financial outcomes and probabilities, matching the key elements from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes expected utility theory as normative and mentions utility with probability, though could have been clearer that utility can be subjective rather than just financial.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies multi-attribute utility theory as normative and mentions evaluation of attributes with values and weights, capturing the essential elements.
- Correct: The student properly identifies prospect theory as descriptive and mentions it considers heuristics and biases along with utility and probability, matching the answer key requirements.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Loss aversion means that individuals place greater importance on avoiding losses than on achieving gains. As a result, when faced with the possibility of a loss, people tend to take greater risks in order to prevent that loss.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion leads people to take greater risks when trying to avoid losses, which demonstrates understanding that loss aversion can decrease risk aversion and make people risk-seeking in loss domains.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves learning connections through correlation. The difference lies in the way these connections are formed. Classical conditioning is about learning associations by recognizing that events occur together in the same place and time. In contrast, operant conditioning is about learning that a specific action leads to a reward or punishment.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as learning connections through correlation, which effectively captures the concept of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as learning associations by recognizing that events occur together in the same place and time, which matches the answer key's description of things happening together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning that a specific action leads to a reward or punishment, which directly aligns with the answer key's definition of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

The distinction is that illusory causation involves an irrational belief that one event causes another, while illusory correlation refers to an irrational belief that two events regularly occur together.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly distinguishes between illusory causation (incorrectly believing one event causes another) and illusory correlation (incorrectly believing two events occur together/correlate). While the wording differs from the answer key, the core conceptual understanding is accurate - causation vs correlation perception errors.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

The schema refers to grasping the workings of the Dutch healthcare system, while the script involves knowing the appropriate behavior at a birthday party.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that understanding the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, though they don't provide the reasoning that it represents knowledge and relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that knowing appropriate behavior at a birthday party is a script, though they don't explain that it's a social schema describing situational behavior.

Score: 1.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

It would be in the physical aspect, as they focus solely on how it functions within the body, which is a physical process.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that behaviorists adopted the physical stance and provides appropriate reasoning that they focused on physical processes in the body, which aligns with the answer key's emphasis on behaviorists focusing on the processes that caused stimulus-response relationships.

Score: 1.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

They choose the functional level because it focuses on how something operates and its usefulness.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that evolutionary psychologists adopt a functional perspective focused on usefulness, which aligns with the design stance. While they use 'functional level' instead of 'design stance,' they demonstrate understanding that this approach examines psychological processes in terms of their function and utility.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

When the action is clear and particular, A leads to B, but not to anything else. Consistently, A causes B every time it can reasonably occur. It is reasonable to believe that A causes B in close proximity both in time and location. When A causes B, the effect happens instantly and in the same place. The cause and effect are closely linked because A occurs, then B follows—not the reverse.

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies distinctness/specificity - that A leads to B but not to other events, demonstrating understanding of this heuristic.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies consistency - that A causes B every time, showing understanding that the relationship should be reliable.
- Incorrect: Student mentions reasonableness but doesn't clearly articulate the plausibility heuristic as common sense making the causal relationship believable.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies contiguity in time and space - mentioning that the effect happens instantly and in the same place as the cause.
- Incorrect: Student describes temporal sequence (A then B) but misses the similarity heuristic - that cause and effect should superficially resemble each other.

Score: 0.6

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

The first bias is negativity bias, where we are more drawn to words with negative emotions. The second bias involves a small number of people creating this content, which then spreads widely across the internet. Because we are attracted to negative content, we see it more frequently and share it more, leading us to overestimate how many people are actually morally outraged.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias and provides an accurate description of being drawn to negative emotional content, which aligns with the answer key's definition.
- Incorrect: The student does not identify the availability heuristic as the second bias. Instead, they describe content spread patterns without naming the specific cognitive bias involved.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of how the two mechanisms work together - negativity bias draws attention to outraged content, leading to overestimation of moral outrage frequency, which matches the key's explanation of the process.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

Framework theories are general intuitive beliefs about how the world operates. The law of contagion can be understood through these theories by noting that when someone views something negatively in one area, they tend to associate that negativity with something else in a different area, leading to superstitious thinking.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes a general mechanism of negative association but fails to specifically identify that biological domain concepts (contagion) are being misapplied to the social/psychological domain, which is the key insight required by the answer key.

Score: 0.0

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A delusional conspiracy theory involves a false belief that is irrational and not accepted by society. In contrast, a non-delusional conspiracy theory lacks such irrational beliefs and can be accepted by the culture.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a delusional conspiracy theory requires both irrationality and lack of social acceptance, while non-delusional theories lack these characteristics. The answer captures the key distinction outlined in the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

One aspect is being male. Another is having narcissistic traits. The final aspect involves clarifying complicated subjects using straightforward explanations.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'being male' as a factor, which matches 'being a man' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'having narcissistic traits' which directly corresponds to 'being narcissistic' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student identifies 'clarifying complicated subjects using straightforward explanations' which accurately captures the concept of 'believing in simple explanations for complex events' from the answer key.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

This can occur through ongoing influence, meaning that incorrect information continues to affect the accurate answer even after we know it is false.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the continued-influence effect (referred to as 'ongoing influence'), which is listed as an acceptable alternative answer in the answer key. The explanation accurately describes how incorrect information continues to influence behavior even after being corrected.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

through simple familiarity.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies familiarity as the key mechanism, which directly corresponds to the mere exposure effect described in the answer key - the tendency to prefer things we are familiar with.

Score: 1.0

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

No, they provide more accurate predictions because they rely less on the positivity bias, which is the tendency to believe that negative events won’t happen to oneself.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people with major depressive disorder are more accurate at predictions and provides the correct underlying mechanism - reduced reliance on positivity bias (equivalent to reduced optimism bias/overly optimistic tendencies mentioned in the answer key).

Score: 1.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

The impact of prior belief becomes stronger as the reliability of sensory information diminishes, making it more significant in guiding perceptual decisions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that prior beliefs become stronger/more significant when sensory information reliability decreases, which directly matches the key concept that perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs under these conditions.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

The initial stage is the pre-conventional level, where moral choices are guided by the prospect of rewards or punishments, focusing mainly on self-interest. The next stage is the conventional level, where decisions are made based on following rules, laws, and seeking approval from others. The final stage is the post-conventional level, which involves considering conflicting moral principles and adhering to broader, universal ethical values.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the pre-conventional level as being guided by rewards/punishments and focusing on self-interest, which aligns with the answer key's description of obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as following rules/laws and seeking approval from others, which matches the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the post-conventional level as involving universal ethical values and broader moral principles, which corresponds to the answer key's description of abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model involves explaining how an event occurred by establishing cause-and-effect connections. We don't create such models for events that did not take place. As a result, this process leads to hindsight bias, since constructing these causal links makes us more likely to believe we could have predicted the outcome.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a causal model involves explaining how events occurred through cause-and-effect connections, which aligns with the concept of a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that constructing causal links makes outcomes seem more predictable in retrospect, which captures how causal models contribute to hindsight bias by making events appear more inevitable than they actually were.

Score: 1.0

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Learning influences hindsight bias due to the curse of knowledge. When we assess the likelihood of an event that has already occurred, we struggle to ignore the new information we have. As a result, we base our judgment on how the event actually unfolded, leading us to believe that we should have predicted it.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that learning contributes to hindsight bias because newly acquired information cannot be ignored when making retrospective likelihood judgments. They accurately mention the curse of knowledge and explain how this leads to overestimating past predictability based on known outcomes.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing involves selecting the optimal option, while satisficing means choosing an option that is satisfactory or sufficient. Individuals with high levels of neuroticism are more likely to use a maximizing approach when making decisions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as selecting the optimal option, which aligns with 'trying to make the best choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as choosing an option that is satisfactory or sufficient, which matches 'making a good-enough choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that individuals with high neuroticism are more likely to use a maximizing approach, which matches the answer key's statement about adopting the maximizing decision style.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

To encourage all students to actively participate with the material, you can create an assignment based on the discussed topics that requires students to provide feedback to their peers. This approach enhances learning, as individuals benefit from receiving active feedback. Additionally, having students give feedback instead of the professor saves both time and resources.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement by proposing a peer feedback system that directly addresses the constraints mentioned (limited time and resources). The answer shows understanding of pedagogical principles by recognizing that peer feedback can enhance learning while being resource-efficient for the instructor.
