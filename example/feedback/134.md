## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

System 1 thinking operates quickly and is based on heuristics, often influenced by emotions. In contrast, System 2 thinking is slower, more intentional, and capable of handling complex moral reasoning, making it the primary mode in the social intuitionist model.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies System 1 thinking as involving emotions and operating quickly through heuristics, which aligns with the answer key's description of System 1 as intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student accurately describes System 2 thinking as slower, more intentional, and involving complex reasoning, which matches the answer key's characterization of System 2 as reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that System 2 is the primary mode in the social intuitionist model. According to Haidt's model and the answer key, System 1 (intuition/emotion) is actually more dominant than System 2.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

The representativeness heuristic is applied because we expect them to dress like a fashion model since that aligns with the typical image or stereotype of their profession. The conjunction fallacy occurs when we think two events are more likely to happen at the same time, even though the probability of both occurring together is actually lower.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying mechanism, though their explanation focuses on dressing rather than physical appearance.
- Incorrect: The student does not provide the correct explanation of the representativeness heuristic. Instead, they incorrectly discuss the conjunction fallacy, which is unrelated to the question about estimating likelihood based on resemblance to stereotypes.

Score: 0.5

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring occurs when an initial piece of information strongly influences our perception. The primacy effect happens when the first information we receive about something significantly shapes our overall impression. Both have a powerful impact, making it difficult to disregard the original anchor or initial information even after learning new details. To alter our perspective, we need to adjust based on the new information provided.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as when initial information strongly influences perception, which aligns with the answer key's definition of taking the first piece of information as a starting point.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as when first information significantly shapes overall impression, which corresponds to the answer key's definition of better remembering the first piece of information.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both concepts involve overreliance on initial/original information that is difficult to disregard, which matches the answer key's point about overreliance on the first piece of information.

Score: 1.0

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over acquiring equivalent gains. Risk aversion involves evaluating the potential risks of an event in relation to its possible rewards. Risk is not solely financial and can be perceived subjectively.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines loss aversion as preferring to avoid losses over acquiring equivalent gains, which matches the answer key's definition.
- Incorrect: The student describes risk aversion as evaluating risks versus rewards, but misses the key concept that risk aversion is about preferring certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 0.5

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias occurs when we exaggerate how strongly and how long an event will affect our future emotions. For example, individuals might overpredict the levels of uncertainty, regret, and loneliness they will feel after a breakup, leading them to remain in an unhappy relationship.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as overestimating how strongly and how long events will affect future emotions, which captures the essence of overestimating the impact of future events on feelings.
- Correct: The student clearly explains how impact bias prevents breakups by stating people overpredict negative emotions like uncertainty, regret, and loneliness after a breakup, causing them to stay in unhappy relationships.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves anticipating how we will feel emotionally in the future. Individuals might experience emotions differently at the moment than they will near the end of their life. Therefore, when making end-of-life decisions, it’s important to recognize that feelings can change over time. Someone who was healthy might have assumed they would prefer death over illness, but this perspective may shift as they age, illustrating the disability paradox.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines affective forecasting as anticipating future emotional states, which matches the answer key's definition of 'predictions about our own future emotional state.'
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of the key concept by explaining that healthy people might assume they'd prefer death over illness, but this perspective may change when actually facing illness, which aligns with the answer key's point about predictions versus reality.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

People tend to exaggerate the likelihood of events with low probabilities. Indeed, they are more prone to overestimating a 10% chance than a 0.01% chance.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people overestimate low probabilities, which aligns with the answer key's first point about merely low probabilities being overestimated.
- Incorrect: The student states people are 'more prone to overestimating a 10% chance than a 0.01% chance' but doesn't mention that extremely low probabilities are often treated as impossibilities. The answer key indicates extremely low probabilities are interpreted as impossibilities, not just less overestimated.

Score: 0.5

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Prospect theory explains how individuals evaluate options by aiming to maximize both financial and subjective benefits, taking into account biases and mental shortcuts. Loss aversion describes the tendency for people to try to gain as much as possible while minimizing losses when making choices. Utility refers to the value assigned by an individual or group to something they wish to avoid losing.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student does not correctly explain loss aversion in terms of utility. They describe it as a general tendency to maximize gains and minimize losses, but fail to mention the key concept that negative utilities (losses) are weighted more heavily than positive utilities (gains), or that the value function is steeper for losses than gains.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected utility theory suggests that value is not solely financial and can be subjective. In contrast, expected value theory is less widely accepted because it does not consider heuristics and biases, unlike other theories such as prospect theory, which is derived from expected utility theory.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected utility theory considers non-financial, subjective values while expected value theory focuses solely on financial values.
- Incorrect: The student mentions that expected value theory doesn't consider heuristics and biases, but fails to specifically identify risk aversion as the key consideration in expected utility theory, instead incorrectly referring to prospect theory as derived from expected utility theory.

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Prospect theory explains how we evaluate losses and gains, considering heuristics and biases. The behavioral life-cycle model describes how we save money through mental accounting. Expected utility theory addresses how we assess losses and gains with subjective factors. Expected value theory focuses on how we make financial choices.

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies expected value theory as focusing on financial choices, which aligns with the answer key's description of financial outcomes with probabilities.
- Correct: Student correctly describes expected utility theory as addressing losses and gains with subjective factors, which matches the answer key's emphasis on subjective utility beyond just financial outcomes.
- Incorrect: Student mentions 'behavioral life-cycle model' instead of multi-attribute utility theory, which is completely different from the answer key's description of multiple attributes with utilities and weights.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies prospect theory as explaining evaluation of losses and gains considering heuristics and biases, which matches the answer key's description as a descriptive behavioral model.

Score: 0.75

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Loss aversion can cause individuals to be more cautious because they fear losses more than they value gains. As a result, they may see risks as not worthwhile and tend to avoid them, particularly when the potential losses are substantial.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes loss aversion as making people more risk averse and cautious about avoiding risks, which is the opposite of what the answer key states. The key point is that loss aversion can actually decrease risk aversion and make people risk-seeking when trying to avoid losses, but the student argues it increases risk aversion.

Score: 0.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning refers to the process of learning by forming associations. Classical conditioning occurs when two stimuli occur together in time and place, leading to a connection between them. Operant conditioning involves learning based on the consequences of behavior, such as rewards or punishments.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as a learning process involving forming associations, which aligns with the answer key's definition of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as occurring when two stimuli happen together in time and place, creating connections between them, which matches the answer key's explanation of learning to associate things that happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning based on behavioral consequences like rewards or punishments, which directly corresponds to the answer key's definition of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation occurs when we assume that one event directly causes another. Illusory correlation happens when we think two factors are connected or influence each other because they appear to follow a similar pattern.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's answer doesn't clearly distinguish between the two concepts. They describe illusory causation as assuming direct causation but don't mention it stems from misinterpreting actual correlations. For illusory correlation, they describe perceiving connections based on similar patterns, but miss the key point that it involves perceiving correlations where none actually exist between variables.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

Knowing how the Dutch healthcare system operates is a schema since it represents a structured body of knowledge. In contrast, knowing how to act at a party is a script because it involves socially accepted behaviors for a typical event.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the Dutch healthcare system as a schema and provides an appropriate explanation that it represents structured knowledge, which aligns with the answer key's point about knowledge and relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies birthday party behavior as a script and explains it involves socially accepted behaviors for a typical event, which matches the answer key's explanation of a social schema describing situational behavior.

Score: 1.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

Behaviorists embraced the social/behavioral approach by assessing behavior through observation, rather than relying on empirical evidence, since they believed it was impossible to measure what goes on inside someone's mind.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies behaviorists as adopting a 'social/behavioral approach' rather than the physical stance. Additionally, the student misunderstands Dennett's stances framework and contains a logical error by contrasting observation with empirical evidence when observation is a form of empirical evidence. The correct answer is that behaviorists adopted the physical stance because they focused on stimulus-response mechanisms as physical processes.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

The social psychology perspective takes an evolutionary view, recognizing humans as inherently social beings. This approach represents a descriptive level of analysis, explaining how people act and behave without making judgments about whether those actions are right or wrong.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies evolutionary psychology as adopting a 'descriptive level of analysis' rather than the design stance. They also confuse evolutionary psychology with social psychology and fail to recognize that evolutionary psychologists analyze psychological processes in terms of their adaptive function, which is characteristic of Dennett's design stance.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Continuity in time and space means A and B must happen simultaneously to be linked in time and location. Temporal order requires one event to happen before the other. Covariation means both events occur together. Distinctiveness ensures that no other factors influence the relationship; the effect on A must result solely from B without external variables. Falsifiability involves testing and disproving the alternative hypothesis (for example, that A does not affect B) before accepting the original hypothesis.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: Student mentions 'distinctiveness' but incorrectly describes it as ensuring no other factors influence the relationship, rather than B following A but not other events.
- Incorrect: Student does not mention consistency (B always follows A) at all.
- Incorrect: Student does not mention plausibility (common sense making causation reasonable) at all.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies 'continuity in time and space' as A and B happening simultaneously and being linked in time and location, which matches contiguity.
- Incorrect: Student does not mention similarity in cause and effect (superficial resemblance between A and B) at all.

Score: 0.2

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Frequency-based availability bias occurs when frequent exposure to something makes related examples more easily recalled, causing us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged (the availability heuristic). Set size judgment involves estimating the number of individuals in a group.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions availability heuristic but does not identify negativity bias as one of the two primary biases that contribute to overestimating moral outrage on social media.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the availability heuristic and explains how frequent exposure makes examples more easily recalled, leading to overestimation of moral outrage.
- Incorrect: The student does not explain the connection between negativity bias and availability heuristic as described in the answer key, instead mentioning 'set size judgment' which is not part of the correct explanation.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

Framework theories are intuitive knowledge systems that assist us in understanding new information. They exist in three areas: biology, physics, and psychology. Sometimes, we apply our beliefs beyond their appropriate domains, as seen in magical contagion effects, where psychological concepts are mistakenly applied to physical phenomena without logical justification.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the direction of domain confusion. They state that psychological concepts are applied to physical phenomena, but the answer key requires recognizing that biological concepts (contagion) are incorrectly applied to social/psychological domains. The student has the framework theory concept correct but misidentifies which domains are involved in the transfer.

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A delusional conspiracy theory is one that is widely rejected by society, with ample evidence disproving it, yet its believers continue to hold onto the false belief and may even become more convinced when confronted with contradictory information. In contrast, a non-delusional conspiracy theory is supported by evidence and is accepted as true by many people.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that delusional conspiracy theories are characterized by being irrational beliefs (described as having 'ample evidence disproving it' and being 'false belief') that are not commonly accepted (described as 'widely rejected by society'). The contrast with non-delusional theories being 'supported by evidence and accepted as true by many people' aligns with the answer key's distinction based on rationality and social acceptance.

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

neuroticism, limited intelligence or education, and a perceived lack of control over events

Feedback:

- Incorrect: Neuroticism is not listed among the cognitive and personality factors in the answer key. The answer key includes narcissism but not neuroticism as a personality factor.
- Correct: Limited intelligence matches the answer key item 'having a low level of intelligence' which is one of the factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking.
- Incorrect: Perceived lack of control over events is not mentioned in the answer key. The key focuses on specific cognitive biases like pattern recognition, agency attribution, and analytical thinking rather than control perception.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Operant conditioning involves learning through consequences such as rewards and punishments. Making mistakes may cause feelings of sadness, but these can be altered by learning the correct answer, and getting it right brings a sense of happiness as a reward. This process resembles anchoring and adjustment, where we start with initial knowledge to respond but must modify our understanding when new information reveals that our original answer was incorrect.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student discusses operant conditioning, emotions, and anchoring/adjustment, but completely misses the key psychological mechanism from the answer key. The correct answer involves source amnesia (forgetting that an incorrect answer was wrong and mistaking it for correct), proactive interference, or the continued-influence effect. The student's response about emotional consequences and adjustment doesn't address how incorrect answers can interfere with learning the correct information.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

Accessibility mechanism: When these messages frequently appear, they are stored in short-term memory, making the information easier to retrieve. Additionally, repeated exposure makes the message seem more accurate and believable. Examples of the message become easier to remember and recall, which increases their perceived favorability.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the core psychological mechanism - that repeated exposure makes messages seem more accurate and believable, and increases perceived favorability. While they don't use the exact terms 'mere exposure effect' or 'illusory-truth effect,' they accurately describe both phenomena: the tendency to prefer familiar things (favorability from repeated exposure) and the illusory-truth effect (repeated information seeming more accurate/believable).

Score: 1.0

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Yes, because they may possess a negative bias. Their mindset and thought patterns tend to be pessimistic, making them more likely to focus on negative outcomes, feel unlucky, or believe the world is working against them. This can reduce their accuracy in making predictions.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that depression makes people less accurate at predictions due to negative bias and pessimism. The answer key indicates that people with major depressive disorder are actually more accurate because they have reduced optimistic bias, not that their negative bias makes them less accurate.

Score: 0.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

When the dependability of sensory information diminishes, the impact of prior beliefs grows stronger to compensate for the unreliability of the sensory data when making judgments. The influence of prior beliefs rises.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when sensory information becomes less reliable, prior beliefs have a stronger influence on perception. They accurately describe the compensatory relationship between sensory reliability and prior belief influence, demonstrating understanding of the key concept.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

Pre-conventional stage – children understand right and wrong based on avoiding punishment and gaining rewards. Conventional stage – individuals follow societal norms by behaving morally and doing what is right, often judging morality by considering whether actions harm others. Post-conventional stage – people develop a strong moral awareness, can distinguish right from wrong independently, and are willing to stand up for their principles if they believe something is unethical.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the pre-conventional level as focusing on avoiding punishment and gaining rewards, which matches the answer key requirement.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as following societal norms and considering harm to others, which aligns with the focus on social norms and other people's feelings from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly describes the post-conventional level as developing independent moral awareness and standing up for principles, which corresponds to the focus on abstract principles and values from the answer key.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

We can use our understanding of an event's results to construct a narrative explaining how it happened and the previous occurrences that caused it. This makes the outcome seem unavoidable, resulting in hindsight bias, where we feel as though we predicted it from the start.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a causal model involves constructing a narrative that explains how an event happened and the previous occurrences that caused it, which aligns with the answer key's definition of a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that the causal model makes outcomes seem unavoidable, which directly corresponds to the answer key's point that events in a causal model seem more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias.

Score: 1.0

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Once we know the result, it's difficult to recall a time when we were unaware of it, which causes hindsight bias—making us think we "always knew" the outcome. As a result, the event seems predetermined, even though prior to its occurrence, we had no information about how it would end.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly explains that learning new information (knowing the result) makes it difficult to recall previous states of uncertainty, which directly aligns with the answer key's point about being unable to avoid taking newly learned information into account when estimating past likelihood judgments.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing involves striving to select the best possible option, aiming for an optimal decision. In contrast, the satisficing approach involves choosing a decision that is adequate or acceptable, though not necessarily the best. Neuroticism is strongly associated with the maximizing style of decision-making.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as striving to select the best possible option and aiming for an optimal decision, which aligns with 'trying to make the best choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as choosing a decision that is adequate or acceptable though not necessarily the best, which matches 'making a good-enough choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly states that neuroticism is strongly associated with the maximizing style of decision-making, which corresponds to the answer key's point about high neuroticism being linked to maximizing decision style.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

You can utilize AI similarly to how it was used for grading exams. Students are more likely to engage with the content if they know they will be tested on it, including topics like operant conditioning, which focuses on rewards and punishments. Additionally, by applying behavioral models and concepts of nudging, you can guide students using prescriptive behavior models that offer practical advice on reading, revising, and overall engagement. This course emphasizes the significance of libertarian paternalism, which encourages influencing behavior while preserving individuals' freedom to choose and think independently. Since humans are social beings, their behavior can be affected by observing others, especially when they see positive outcomes, a process known as vicarious learning.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement with the question by drawing on multiple course concepts (operant conditioning, nudging, behavioral models, libertarian paternalism, vicarious learning) and connecting them to practical teaching strategies. They show understanding of how AI can be used for efficient grading, how behavioral principles can motivate student engagement, and how social learning can be leveraged in educational settings. The answer reflects thoughtful consideration of the challenge posed.
