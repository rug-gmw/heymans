## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

In Haidt's model, system 1 takes the lead. Moral judgments are mostly automatic and intuitive ("I can't explain it, but I just feel opposed"), while system 2 is involved only in specific cases, such as when a friend holds a different view or when there is a conflict between two moral principles.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student does not explicitly define what System 1 thinking refers to in terms of intuitions or emotions, though they describe it as 'automatic and intuitive'.
- Incorrect: The student does not explicitly define what System 2 thinking refers to in terms of reasoning, rational thought, or deliberation.
- Correct: The student clearly states that 'system 1 takes the lead' and describes moral judgments as 'mostly automatic and intuitive', correctly identifying System 1 as dominant.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

The representativeness heuristic is when we estimate the likelihood of something being part of a group by how closely it matches the typical characteristics of that group.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student does not explicitly identify that the representativeness heuristic underlies the assumption described in the question about the colleague who looks like a fashion model.
- Correct: The student correctly explains the representativeness heuristic as estimating likelihood of group membership based on how closely something matches typical characteristics of that group, which aligns with the answer key's explanation.

Score: 0.5

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring is the initial impression we form of something, while the primacy effect refers to the outsized influence that first impression has on our overall perception. Both are powerful, and although it is possible to adjust our view afterward, the changes tend to be small.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes anchoring as 'initial impression' rather than the tendency to use the first piece of information as a starting point for judgments or decisions.
- Incorrect: The student confuses the primacy effect with anchoring's influence mechanism, rather than correctly identifying it as the tendency to better remember first information.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both phenomena involve overreliance on first information, though they express this as 'outsized influence of first impression' and difficulty in adjustment.

Score: 0.3333333333333333

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Risk aversion is about steering clear of risks, whereas loss aversion is about preventing losses. With risk aversion, we prefer a guaranteed outcome, but when a situation is presented as a potential loss, we are more likely to take a risk to avoid that loss.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions 'preventing losses' but fails to capture the key concept that loss aversion is about weighing losses more heavily than equivalent gains. The explanation about taking risks to avoid losses describes loss aversion's behavioral consequences but misses the fundamental asymmetry in how we value gains versus losses.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that risk aversion involves preferring guaranteed outcomes, which aligns with the answer key's definition of preferring certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 0.5

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias occurs when we exaggerate how much future events will influence our emotions. This might stop a breakup from happening because we assume it will cause us more unhappiness than it actually will.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as exaggerating how much future events will influence our emotions, which matches the answer key's definition of overestimating the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly explains that impact bias prevents breakups because people assume it will cause more unhappiness than it actually will, which aligns with the answer key's point about overestimating how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting refers to our ability to anticipate how we will feel emotionally in the future, and we depend on this when making choices. It matters because, for example, we might claim we'd prefer death over being terminally ill, yet when confronted with illness, our feelings often differ. This happens because we tend to exaggerate how much the illness will impact our emotional well-being.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines affective forecasting as predictions about future emotional states, using the phrase 'anticipate how we will feel emotionally in the future' which captures the essence of the definition.
- Correct: The student accurately explains the relevance to end-of-life decisions by noting that healthy people may prefer death when imagining terminal illness, but their actual preferences may differ when they become ill, which aligns with the answer key's core point.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

People tend to overvalue small chances, yet regard extremely low chances as impossible.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people 'overvalue small chances' which aligns with the answer key point that merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Correct: The student accurately states that people 'regard extremely low chances as impossible' which directly matches the answer key point about extremely low probabilities being interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion represents the strong negative impact that a loss has.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The answer mentions that losses have a strong negative impact but fails to capture the key comparative aspect - that losses are weighed more heavily than equivalent gains, or that the value function is steeper for losses than gains.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected utility theory assigns a personal value to each outcome, whereas expected value theory focuses on monetary values. Additionally, expected utility theory accounts for risk aversion, unlike expected value theory.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory focuses on monetary/financial values while expected utility theory assigns personal values to outcomes, which aligns with the answer key's distinction between financial and non-financial values.
- Correct: The student accurately states that expected utility theory accounts for risk aversion while expected value theory does not, which matches the answer key's point about expected utility theory considering risk aversion versus expected value theory not considering heuristics and biases.

Score: 1.0

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected value theory is a normative framework involving outcomes that have various monetary values and associated probabilities. Expected utility theory is a normative approach that deals with outcomes having different subjective utilities and probabilities, incorporating risk aversion. Multi-attribute utility theory is a normative model that evaluates options based on multiple attributes, each assigned specific weights rather than probabilities. Prospect theory is a descriptive model that builds on expected utility theory by including heuristics and biases.

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies expected value theory as a normative model with monetary outcomes and probabilities, matching the key concept of financial outcomes with probabilities.
- Correct: Student accurately describes expected utility theory as normative with subjective utilities and probabilities, correctly noting it goes beyond financial outcomes and mentions risk aversion which aligns with utility concepts.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies multi-attribute utility theory as normative with multiple attributes and weights, accurately distinguishing weights from probabilities as the key mechanism.
- Correct: Student properly characterizes prospect theory as descriptive, building on expected utility theory while incorporating heuristics and biases, matching the behavioral nature described in the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

When a risk is presented as a potential loss, individuals tend to be less cautious and may even take more risks.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion can lead people to become less risk averse (less cautious) and even risk seeking when facing potential losses, which aligns with the key concept in the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves learning connections through the occurrence of events together. In classical conditioning, two stimuli are linked because they happen simultaneously in the same environment, whereas in operant conditioning, one event happens after another, usually involving a reward or punishment following a behavior.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as learning connections/associations through events occurring together, which aligns with the key concept of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as linking two stimuli that happen simultaneously in the same environment, which matches the answer key's description of associating things that happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as involving rewards or punishments following behavior, which aligns with the answer key's definition of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory correlation occurs when we perceive a relationship between two variables that isn't actually there, whereas illusory causation happens when we believe one thing causes another despite no real causal link existing.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that illusory correlation is perceiving a relationship/correlation that doesn't exist, and illusory causation is believing in a causal relationship that doesn't exist. While the wording differs slightly from the answer key, the core distinction is accurate - one involves false perception of correlation, the other involves false attribution of causation.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

Knowing how to act at a birthday party is a script because it represents a social schema tailored to a particular cultural context. Similarly, comprehending the Dutch healthcare system involves a schema, as it requires grasping the relationships between different ideas, such as framework theories.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that understanding the Dutch healthcare system is a schema and provides an appropriate justification about grasping relationships between different ideas, which aligns with the concept of schemas as knowledge structures.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that knowing how to act at a birthday party is a script and accurately describes it as a social schema for a particular cultural context, which matches the answer key's explanation of scripts as behavioral guidelines for specific situations.

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

The physical or mechanical aspect, as it emphasizes the impact one thing has on another.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the physical stance and provides appropriate reasoning by noting the emphasis on causal relationships ('impact one thing has on another'), which aligns with behaviorism's focus on stimulus-response causation.

Score: 1.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

They take a functional or design perspective, focusing on the reasons behind why an individual or object possesses particular traits.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance (mentioning both 'functional' and 'design perspective') and provides an accurate explanation that they focus on the reasons/functions behind traits, which aligns with the answer key's emphasis on considering psychological processes in terms of their function.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

distinct: B occurs solely as a result of A happening plausible: it is reasonable to believe that A leads to B consistent: B invariably follows whenever A takes place contiguous in time and space: A and B happen simultaneously and in the same location action and intention: A and B are similar in nature or purpose

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies distinctness/specificity, explaining that B occurs solely as a result of A, which matches the concept that B follows A but not other events.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies consistency, stating that B invariably follows whenever A takes place, which aligns with the answer key's 'B always follows A'.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies plausibility, explaining it as reasonable to believe A leads to B, which matches the answer key's concept of common sense making causation plausible.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies contiguity in time and space, stating A and B happen simultaneously and in the same location, which matches the answer key exactly.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies 'action and intention' instead of 'similarity in cause and effect'. While they mention similarity in nature/purpose, this doesn't capture the correct heuristic of superficial resemblance between cause and effect.

Score: 0.8

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Negativity bias refers to our tendency to pay more attention to negative emotional information, while the availability heuristic involves assessing how likely something is based on how easily we can recall related instances. These concepts interact because we concentrate on morally outraged content due to its negative nature, causing such examples to quickly come to mind when estimating how many people are morally outraged.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines negativity bias as the tendency to pay more attention to negative emotional information, which aligns with the answer key's description of seeking out or placing more weight on negative information like morally outraged content.
- Correct: The student accurately defines the availability heuristic as assessing likelihood based on how easily we can recall related instances, which matches the answer key's definition of estimating frequency or probability based on ease of recall.
- Correct: The student clearly explains the interaction between the two biases: negativity bias causes us to focus on morally outraged content, which makes these examples readily available in memory, leading to overestimation through the availability heuristic.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

It is practical knowledge based on general understanding rather than precise scientific facts. The original owner is not truly important, yet it still feels unpleasant because we connect it to that individual.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes the phenomenon but fails to explain it in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge. The answer does not mention how biological contagion concepts are being misapplied to social/psychological domains, which is the key theoretical framework needed to answer this question.

Score: 0.0

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

If the conspiracy theory is commonly accepted or broadly believed within the person's culture, it is not considered delusional.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that common acceptance within a culture is a key factor in distinguishing non-delusional from delusional conspiracy theories, which aligns with the answer key's criterion that delusional theories are 'not commonly accepted.'

Score: 1.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

Excessive self-focus, detecting order in chaos, and having faith in supernatural occurrences.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student's answer 'excessive self-focus' correctly identifies narcissism as a factor contributing to conspiratorial thinking.
- Correct: The student's answer 'detecting order in chaos' accurately describes the tendency to see patterns in randomness, which is a key cognitive factor.
- Correct: The student's answer 'having faith in supernatural occurrences' correctly identifies believing in paranormal phenomena as a contributing factor.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

This occurs due to source amnesia, where we forget the context or origin of the information we have acquired.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies source amnesia as the mechanism and provides an accurate explanation that forgetting the context/origin of information would lead to mistaking incorrect answers for correct ones.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

Through repeated exposure, we tend to favor things that are familiar to us.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the mere exposure effect, explaining that repeated exposure leads to favoring familiar things, which matches the answer key's description of the tendency to prefer things we are familiar with.

Score: 1.0

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

No, it actually increases their accuracy because individuals with major depressive disorder lack a positivity bias, which is the tendency to underestimate the chances of negative events occurring to oneself.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that major depressive disorder increases accuracy in predictions and accurately explains this is due to the absence of positivity bias (overly optimistic tendencies), which aligns with the answer key's explanation of reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Score: 1.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

As the trustworthiness of sensory data or evidence diminishes, the impact of pre-existing beliefs on the interpretation of new information grows, meaning we no longer act as perfect observers.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when sensory data becomes less trustworthy/reliable, prior beliefs have greater influence on perception. The answer demonstrates understanding of the core concept that decreased sensory reliability leads to increased reliance on expectations/priors in the ideal observer model.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

The pre-conventional level involves understanding morality based on rewards and punishments, with a primary emphasis on self-interest and minimal consideration for mutual exchange. The conventional level centers on how individuals are perceived by others, adherence to laws, and consideration of others' feelings. The post-conventional level acknowledges that moral principles can sometimes clash and emphasizes a universal set of ethical values.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the pre-conventional level as focusing on rewards and punishments with emphasis on self-interest, which aligns with the answer key's description of obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as centering on how individuals are perceived by others, adherence to laws, and consideration of others' feelings, which matches the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the post-conventional level as emphasizing universal ethical values and acknowledging conflicts between moral principles, which aligns with the answer key's description of focusing on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

This occurs when we create a cause-and-effect story for events that took place, but not for those that didn't occur but had the potential to. This process helps make the actual events seem much more reasonable.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a causal model involves creating a cause-and-effect story/narrative for past events, which aligns with the answer key's definition of a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student accurately explains how causal models contribute to hindsight bias by making actual events seem 'much more reasonable' (inevitable), which matches the answer key's point about events seeming more inevitable than they were.

Score: 1.0

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

We must consider newly obtained information when evaluating an outcome, which makes the reasoning seem much more logical.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that newly obtained information must be considered when evaluating past events, which is the core mechanism of hindsight bias. While they phrase it as making reasoning 'seem more logical' rather than explicitly stating we cannot avoid taking this information into account when estimating past likelihood judgments, they demonstrate understanding of the fundamental concept.

Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing involves striving to choose the best possible option, while satisficing means settling for a decision that is adequate. A person with neurotic tendencies is more likely to engage in maximizing.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as striving to choose the best possible option, which aligns with the answer key's definition of trying to make the best choice.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as settling for a decision that is adequate, which matches the answer key's definition of making a good-enough choice.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a person with neurotic tendencies (high neuroticism) is more likely to engage in maximizing, which matches the answer key's statement about the maximizing decision style.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

You might consider implementing a gentle prompt for lecture attendance, which doesn’t need to be time-consuming—having students scan a QR code at the start could work—aimed at subtly encouraging attendance. Incorporating this into the grading system, such as making it worth 5% or offering it as a bonus, could increase its effectiveness. Another approach is to introduce a weekly multiple-choice quiz with a set deadline to motivate students to stay current with the material. These quizzes don’t necessarily need to be graded, though they can be; simply knowing there’s a quiz and a deadline can encourage participation. The "who did what" component in this course was also an effective nudge, as it prompts students to reflect on their contributions and motivates them to put in enough effort.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement by providing multiple concrete, practical strategies for encouraging student participation without requiring intensive personalized feedback. They suggest QR code attendance tracking, weekly multiple-choice quizzes, and reflection components, showing understanding of scalable assessment methods that balance engagement with resource constraints.
