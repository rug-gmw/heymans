## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

System 1 is a quick and automatic mode of thinking that depends on mental shortcuts. In contrast, System 2 is slower, more effortful, and intentional, allowing for self-reflection. This framework suggests that System 1 is the primary mode of thinking and is more intuitive, while System 2 is more logical. Given the complexity of the world, we tend to depend more on System 1 because System 2's slower pace is not well-suited to handling such complexity.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly describes System 1 as quick and automatic but fails to explicitly connect it to intuitions or emotions in the context of moral judgment as required by Haidt's model.
- Incorrect: The student correctly describes System 2 as slower and more effortful but fails to explicitly identify it as reasoning, rational thought, or deliberation in the context of moral judgment.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 is the primary/dominant mode of thinking, stating 'System 1 is the primary mode of thinking' and explaining we depend more on it due to complexity.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

This is based on the representativeness heuristic, which suggests that people assess the likelihood of something belonging to category B by how closely it matches the typical features of that category. However, crucial factors such as the actual probability of the category, known as base-rate information, are often ignored—a phenomenon referred to as base-rate neglect.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive mechanism in this scenario.
- Correct: The student provides an accurate explanation of the representativeness heuristic, describing how people assess likelihood based on similarity to typical category features. The additional mention of base-rate neglect shows deeper understanding beyond the basic requirement.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring refers to a mental process where your judgment about something is influenced by the initial impression. The primacy effect suggests that the first impression holds the greatest significance and has the most lasting impact. Both concepts share the idea that the initial encounter with something plays a crucial role in shaping your overall perception or opinion.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as being influenced by initial information, which aligns with the answer key's description of taking the first piece of information as a starting point.
- Incorrect: The student describes primacy effect as first impressions having lasting impact, but misses the key concept that it's specifically about better remembering the first piece of information.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both concepts involve the initial encounter/first information playing a crucial role, which matches the answer key's point about overreliance on first information.

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion means that people tend to place greater importance on avoiding losses than on acquiring equivalent gains. Risk aversion means that individuals prefer to minimize exposure to risk whenever they can.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves placing greater importance on avoiding losses than on acquiring equivalent gains, which matches the answer key's description of weighing losses more heavily than gains.
- Correct: The student accurately describes risk aversion as preferring to minimize exposure to risk, which aligns with the answer key's definition of preferring certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 1.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias is connected to affective forecasting and refers to the tendency of individuals to exaggerate the emotional effects their choices will have on them. For example, when a person is dissatisfied in a relationship, they may believe that ending it will affect their unhappiness more profoundly than it truly does, which often stops them from going through with the breakup.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as the tendency to exaggerate/overestimate emotional effects of future events, which aligns with the answer key's definition of overestimating impact on future feelings.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that impact bias prevents breakups because people overestimate how bad ending the relationship will make them feel, matching the answer key's second point.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting refers to how people predict their future emotions. Humans tend to be quite inaccurate at this. This concept is crucial in end-of-life decisions because of the disability paradox. This paradox means that when people imagine having a serious illness or disability, they often say they would prefer to die rather than live under those conditions. However, when actually experiencing that situation, many find they can still live a fulfilling life. Therefore, when considering signing a contract requesting euthanasia for a future time when one is very ill and unable to make decisions, it is important to keep this in mind.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines affective forecasting as how people predict their future emotions, which matches the answer key's definition of predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Correct: The student accurately captures the key concept that healthy people may predict preferring death when sick, but when actually sick may not prefer to die. They explain this through the disability paradox and provide the concrete example of advance directives for euthanasia.

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

People tend to overestimate low probabilities, but when a probability is extremely low, they perceive it as impossible.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people overestimate low probabilities, which aligns with the answer key's point about merely low probabilities being overestimated.
- Correct: The student accurately states that extremely low probabilities are perceived as impossible, which matches the answer key's point about extremely low probabilities being interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency of people to place more importance on losses than on gains. In other words, when evaluating utility, individuals consistently show a bias where negative outcomes are perceived as more significant than positive ones.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion means losses are weighted more heavily than gains, which directly corresponds to the answer key's point about negative utilities being weighed more heavily than positive utilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory relies solely on financial amounts, while expected utility allows for subjective values. In expected utility, the values can be personal or individual, unlike in expected value where they are objective.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory deals with objective financial amounts while expected utility theory incorporates subjective/personal values, which aligns with the distinction between financial and non-financial values.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention risk aversion or heuristics and biases, which is the key difference regarding how the theories handle decision-making under uncertainty.

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected value theory is a normative model that considers the probability and monetary value of an outcome to guide decision-making. Expected utility theory is also a normative model that evaluates probability and value, but these values can be subjective. Multi-attribute utility theory is a normative framework that assesses multiple attributes, each with its own weight and utility, without factoring in probability, instead prioritizing the importance of different attributes. Prospect theory, a descriptive model, resembles expected utility theory but incorporates heuristics and biases. It is based on three main assumptions: people evaluate outcomes in terms of gains and losses rather than absolute values, there are consistent biases in how utility is estimated, and there are systematic errors in how probabilities are perceived.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as a normative model that considers probability and monetary outcomes for decision-making, which aligns with the answer key's description of financial outcomes with probabilities.
- Correct: The student accurately describes expected utility theory as a normative model similar to expected value theory but with subjective utilities rather than just financial outcomes, matching the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies multi-attribute utility theory as a normative model with multiple attributes having utilities and weights, though they add that it doesn't factor in probability, which is a reasonable interpretation.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies prospect theory as a descriptive model similar to expected utility theory but incorporating heuristics and biases, and provides additional detail about its key assumptions which demonstrates good understanding.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

When the chances of losing and gaining are equal, people tend to focus more on the potential loss than the gain, making them less likely to take the risk and more inclined to avoid it.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes how loss aversion makes people more risk averse in general situations, but misses the key point that when people are already facing a potential loss, loss aversion can actually make them risk-seeking as they try to avoid that loss.

Score: 0.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves learning to connect events that occur together. Classical conditioning happens when a person learns to link two stimuli that frequently occur close together in time and place. Operant conditioning occurs when a person learns to associate their behavior with a consequence, such as a reward or punishment.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as learning connections/associations between events that occur together, which aligns with the answer key's definition of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as learning to link two stimuli that occur close together in time and place, which matches the answer key's explanation of associating things that happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning to associate behavior with consequences like rewards or punishments, which directly corresponds to the answer key's definition of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation occurs when a person believes one event causes another, even though only a correlation exists. Illusory correlation happens when someone perceives a correlation between events that do not actually have any association. The key distinction is that in the first case, some relationship exists, while in the second, no relationship is present.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that illusory causation involves misinterpreting correlation as causation, and illusory correlation involves perceiving a correlation that doesn't actually exist. The explanation clearly distinguishes between the two concepts and accurately captures that illusory causation assumes some relationship exists while illusory correlation involves no actual relationship.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

The test of Dutch culture is a mental framework called a schema, which uses general knowledge to understand new situations or ideas. The section about the birthday party is a script, outlining the sequence of actions in a specific context that is influenced by cultural norms.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the entire 'test of Dutch culture' as a schema, rather than specifically identifying that understanding the Dutch healthcare system is a schema. The student doesn't distinguish between the two examples given in the question.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the birthday party behavior as a script and provides an accurate explanation that it involves a sequence of actions in a specific context influenced by cultural norms.

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

Behaviorists took the physical stance since it focuses on understanding why something occurs and how it functions, which aligns with the approach behaviorists use.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly identifies that behaviorists adopted the physical stance, but the explanation is incorrect. The student describes the physical stance as focusing on 'why something occurs and how it functions,' which better describes the design stance. The physical stance actually focuses on the mechanical/causal processes - in this case, how stimuli physically cause behavioral responses, which the student does not mention.

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

Evolutionary psychologists adopt a design perspective because they seek to understand the reasons behind the development or formation of something in a particular way.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance and provides an accurate explanation that they focus on understanding the reasons behind how psychological processes developed, which aligns with the functional perspective described in the answer key.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Event A should have a cause and effect relationship similar to that of event B, occurring close together in both time and place. Event A must take place immediately before event B and at the exact same location. Event A should directly influence event B, not event C. Whenever event A occurs, event B should also occur. Event B must be a reasonable and logical outcome of event A.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions that A should directly influence B and not C, which touches on distinctness, but doesn't clearly explain the concept that B should follow A but not other events.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that whenever event A occurs, event B should also occur, which captures the essence of consistency.
- Correct: The student states that event B must be a reasonable and logical outcome of event A, which correctly describes the plausibility heuristic.
- Correct: The student clearly describes that A must take place immediately before B and at the exact same location, which accurately captures contiguity in time and space.
- Incorrect: The student mentions that A should have a cause and effect relationship similar to B, but this misses the key point about superficial resemblance between cause and effect.

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

The availability bias and negativity bias are at play. Negativity bias refers to our tendency to focus on negative emotional content, such as moral outrage. Availability bias means we estimate how likely or common something is based on how quickly it comes to mind. Since moral outrage captures our attention more, it is more easily recalled, leading us to overestimate how often it occurs.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias and explains it as the tendency to focus on negative emotional content, including moral outrage, which aligns with the answer key's definition.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies availability bias (heuristic) and accurately explains it as estimating likelihood based on how easily examples come to mind, matching the answer key's definition.
- Correct: The student successfully explains the connection between the two biases - that negativity bias makes moral outrage more attention-grabbing and memorable, which through availability bias leads to overestimating its frequency.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

Magical contagion occurs when a person avoids something due to a negative connection they have with it, even though there is no actual problem with the item itself. For example, if you are cold and the only sweater available belongs to someone you dislike, framework theories suggest you would wear it to get warm. However, because the sweater is associated with someone you hate, you develop a negative feeling toward it, causing magical contagion. As a result, you might choose to avoid wearing it and stay cold, despite this being irrational.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes the phenomenon of magical contagion accurately but fails to explain it in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge. The answer does not identify that this involves the misapplication of biological contagion concepts to the social/psychological domain, which is the key theoretical explanation requested.

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A delusional conspiracy theory is an irrational belief that is not accepted by society, whereas a non-delusional conspiracy theory can be widely accepted within a culture.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a delusional conspiracy theory requires both irrationality and lack of social acceptance, while non-delusional conspiracy theories can be widely accepted. This captures the key distinction from the answer key.

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

Having narcissistic traits, being male, and possessing limited education.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies narcissistic traits as a factor contributing to conspiratorial thinking, which matches 'being narcissistic' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies being male as a factor, which matches 'being a man' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student mentions 'limited education' which aligns with 'having a low level of intelligence' from the answer key, as both relate to cognitive limitations that contribute to conspiratorial thinking.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

By means of the primacy effect.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The primacy effect refers to better recall of items presented first in a sequence, not to the interference mechanism where incorrect answers can be mistaken for correct ones due to source amnesia or proactive interference.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

Mere exposure refers to the tendency for individuals to develop a preference for things they have been exposed to more frequently.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies mere exposure as the psychological mechanism and accurately describes it as the tendency to develop preference for things with more frequent exposure, which matches the answer key's definition of preferring familiar things.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

No, it will actually improve their accuracy. Healthy individuals tend to exhibit unrealistic optimism, while those with MDD have a more realistic perspective when assessing the likelihood of events such as developing cancer.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that MDD improves accuracy in predictions and explains this is due to reduced unrealistic optimism in healthy individuals compared to the more realistic perspective of those with MDD. The specific example of cancer risk assessment demonstrates understanding of the concept.

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

As the accuracy of sensory input diminishes, your existing beliefs play a larger role, causing your perception to align more closely with those prior beliefs compared to when sensory information is trustworthy.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when sensory information becomes less reliable/accurate, prior beliefs have increased influence on perception, and they understand the comparative aspect - that this influence is greater than when sensory information is trustworthy.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

Pre-conventional: You act to avoid punishment or to receive a reward. Conventional: You act because others will respond or because it follows social rules. Post-conventional: You act based on your own sense of what is right or ethical.

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly describes pre-conventional level as acting to avoid punishment or receive rewards, which matches the answer key's focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: Student accurately describes conventional level as acting based on others' responses and social rules, which aligns with the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: Student correctly describes post-conventional level as acting based on one's own sense of what is right or ethical, which corresponds to the answer key's focus on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model refers to the idea that individuals naturally find it simple to understand cause-and-effect relationships when reflecting on events that actually occurred, but struggle to do so with hypothetical situations that didn't happen. Hindsight bias describes the tendency for people to believe they predicted an outcome all along, even if they did not. Causal models play a role in this bias because the real event seems much more rational compared to alternative possibilities, leading people to think it was obvious beforehand.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a causal model involves understanding cause-and-effect relationships of past events, though they phrase it as finding it 'simple to understand' rather than explicitly calling it a 'coherent narrative.' The core concept is present.
- Correct: The student accurately explains how causal models contribute to hindsight bias by making the actual outcome seem 'much more rational' and 'obvious beforehand' compared to alternatives, which aligns with the answer key's point about events seeming more inevitable than they were.

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Learning plays a role in hindsight bias because it's almost impossible for us to ignore the information we've gained about an event. As a result, we tend to believe we predicted the outcome all along, even if we didn't, since we can't easily imagine not knowing what we now do. This phenomenon is also referred to as the curse of knowledge.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly explains that newly learned information cannot be avoided when estimating past likelihood judgments, leading to hindsight bias. They also correctly identify this as the curse of knowledge, demonstrating full understanding of the concept.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing involves aiming to choose the best possible option, while satisficing involves settling for a choice that is good enough. Since neuroticism is associated with maximizing, a person high in this trait is likely to use a maximizing approach when making decisions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as 'aiming to choose the best possible option' which aligns with the answer key's 'trying to make the best choice'.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as 'settling for a choice that is good enough' which matches the answer key's 'making a good-enough choice'.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people high in neuroticism are likely to use a maximizing approach, which matches the answer key's expectation.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

When I want students to focus on a particular section of the material, I use strongly negative language since the negativity bias makes them more likely to notice it. Additionally, I repeat the key points at both the beginning and the end of the lecture because frequent exposure increases the chances they will remember them later, thanks to the availability bias. I also provide an opportunity for a small quiz after each lecture, rewarding those who score above a certain threshold with a 0.1 bonus on the exam. This approach encourages them to pay attention and engage with the content.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement with the question by applying specific psychological concepts (negativity bias, availability bias) to educational strategies and proposing concrete solutions (using negative language for emphasis, repetition of key points, incentivized quizzes). While some approaches may be debatable pedagogically, the answer shows thoughtful consideration of how to encourage student engagement within resource constraints.

Score: 1.0
