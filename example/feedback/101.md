Grade: 10.0

## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

The model suggests that moral judgments are formed instinctively through System 1 thinking. In contrast, we tend to think that judgments result from deliberate reasoning. This reasoning, involving System 2 thinking, emerges only when there is sufficient time, motivation, conflicting gut feelings, or an absence of strong instincts. As a result, System 1 thinking plays the primary role in moral decision-making.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 thinking involves instinctive/intuitive processes in moral judgment formation, which aligns with the answer key's requirement about System 1 being intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student accurately describes System 2 thinking as 'deliberate reasoning' which matches the answer key's specification that System 2 refers to reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student clearly states that 'System 1 thinking plays the primary role in moral decision-making,' which directly satisfies the answer key requirement that System 1 is more dominant than System 2.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

The basic mental shortcut involved is the representativeness heuristic, where individuals categorize items according to how closely they match a standard example of that category. Yet, they overlook the overall frequency or base rate of that category when making this assessment.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying mental process in this scenario.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that the representativeness heuristic involves categorizing based on how closely someone matches a stereotype or standard example of that category. The additional mention of overlooking base rates shows deeper understanding of this heuristic's limitations.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring involves evaluating something by relying on the initial information received, which acts as a benchmark for all subsequent data. The primacy effect, seen in memory and impression formation, refers to the tendency to give greater weight to the first information encountered compared to what follows. Both concepts share the idea that early information has a stronger impact on later thinking than later information does.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as relying on initial information as a benchmark, which captures the essence of taking the first piece of information as a starting point.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as giving greater weight to first information encountered, which aligns with the tendency to better remember first information.
- Correct: The student clearly identifies that both concepts share the commonality of early/first information having stronger impact, which matches the overreliance on first information from the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the human inclination to steer clear of losses and to feel the pain of losing more intensely than the pleasure of gaining. In contrast, risk aversion describes the tendency to avoid uncertain situations and to favor sure outcomes instead of taking chances.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves feeling losses more intensely than gains, which captures the core concept of weighing losses more heavily than equivalent gains.
- Correct: The student accurately describes risk aversion as the tendency to avoid uncertain situations and favor sure outcomes, which correctly captures the preference for certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 1.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias refers to the tendency to exaggerate the strength and length of future emotions when anticipating how an event will affect us. For example, individuals in an unhappy relationship may overpredict the emotional pain of a breakup, leading them to choose not to end the relationship.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as the tendency to exaggerate future emotions, which aligns with overestimating the impact of future events on our feelings.
- Correct: The student accurately explains how impact bias prevents breakups by stating people overpredict the emotional pain, which matches the key point about overestimating how bad a breakup will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting refers to predicting how an event will affect our emotions in the future. People often overestimate how strong and long-lasting these emotions will be, a phenomenon known as impact bias. If a patient expresses a desire to end their life if their illness worsens but later cannot communicate, doctors and family members need to recognize that the patient's assessment of their suffering and decision may have been influenced by this bias.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines affective forecasting as predicting how events will affect our future emotions, which aligns with the answer key's definition of predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of the key concept that healthy people may make different decisions about end-of-life care than they would when actually experiencing illness, explaining this through impact bias and its implications for advance directives.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

Individuals tend to overvalue small chances like 10% due to their fear of risk, whereas extremely tiny probabilities like 0.01% are seen as virtually impossible and therefore ignored.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that low probabilities like 10% are overestimated, though they attribute this to 'fear of risk' rather than the probability weighting function from prospect theory.
- Correct: The student accurately states that extremely low probabilities like 0.01% are treated as virtually impossible and ignored, which aligns with the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

In the context of utility theory, loss aversion implies that the negative utility associated with a loss is significantly greater than the positive utility derived from an equivalent gain. For example, losing 5€ could result in a negative utility of -100, whereas gaining 5€ might yield a positive utility of only +75.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly explains that loss aversion means negative utilities from losses are weighted more heavily than positive utilities from equivalent gains, and provides a clear numerical example demonstrating this asymmetry.

Score: 1.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory is used solely for economic choices, whereas expected utility theory can be applied to a broader array of decisions. Expected utility theory takes into account people's aversion to risk, while expected value theory assumes that decision-making is entirely rational.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory is limited to economic/financial contexts while expected utility theory applies more broadly, which aligns with the answer key's distinction between financial and non-financial values.
- Correct: The student accurately states that expected utility theory considers risk aversion while expected value theory assumes rational decision-making, which corresponds to the answer key's point about expected utility theory considering risk aversion versus expected value theory not considering heuristics and biases.

Score: 1.0

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

1. Expected value theory is a normative framework for economic decision making that incorporates probability and value. 2. Expected Utility theory, similar in structure to expected value theory, serves as a decision-making model applied in different contexts, assuming primarily rational choices while also accounting for risk aversion. 3. Multi-attribute Utility theory builds upon expected utility theory by considering multiple attributes for each decision outcome, each with its own utility and assigned weight. 4. Prospect theory expands on expected utility theory as a descriptive model that includes human biases in assessing utility and probability.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as a normative framework that incorporates probability and value, which aligns with the answer key's description of a normative model with probabilistic financial outcomes.
- Correct: The student accurately describes expected utility theory as similar to expected value theory but applied in different contexts with rational choices and risk aversion, which corresponds to the answer key's explanation of outcomes having subjective utility beyond just financial value.
- Correct: The student correctly explains multi-attribute utility theory as building on expected utility theory with multiple attributes having their own utilities and weights, matching the answer key's description perfectly.
- Correct: The student properly identifies prospect theory as a descriptive model that expands on expected utility theory by including human biases, which aligns with the answer key's description of it being descriptive/behavioral and considering heuristics and biases.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Individuals may become more willing to take risks when a situation is presented as a potential loss, as they aim to prevent that loss.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion leads people to become more willing to take risks when facing potential losses, which demonstrates understanding that loss aversion can decrease risk aversion and make people risk-seeking in loss domains.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves learning to connect two stimuli. In classical conditioning, one learns that one stimulus follows another closely in time, whereas in operant conditioning, learning occurs by linking a behavior with a consequence, such as a reward or punishment.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as a form of learning involving connections/associations, which aligns with the key concept of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as learning that one stimulus follows another closely in time, which captures the essence of learning associations when things happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as linking behavior with consequences like rewards or punishments, which matches the answer key's definition of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation occurs when we perceive that one event causes another, even though the connection may only be a correlation. Illusory correlation happens when we believe two events frequently occur together, despite the fact that they often happen independently.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly distinguishes between illusory causation (misinterpreting correlation as causation) and illusory correlation (perceiving correlation where none exists). The explanation accurately captures that illusory causation involves incorrectly attributing causal relationships to correlational data, while illusory correlation involves perceiving relationships between variables that are not actually correlated.

Score: 1.0

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

Comprehending the Dutch healthcare system can be seen as a schema. Schemas are broad frameworks of knowledge that depict something we know well. Knowing how to act at a birthday party is an example of a script. A script is a specific kind of schema that guides behavior in particular social contexts.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the Dutch healthcare system as a schema and provides an accurate explanation that schemas are frameworks of knowledge, which aligns with the answer key's emphasis on knowledge and relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies birthday party behavior as a script and accurately explains that scripts are specific schemas that guide behavior in particular social contexts, which matches the answer key's description of scripts as social schemas for specific situations.

Score: 1.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

Behaviorists embraced the physical standpoint because they believed that only observable phenomena can be measured. In contrast, they ignored the purpose of behavior as well as intentions and beliefs.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: While the student correctly identifies that behaviorists adopted the physical stance and mentions they focused on observable phenomena, they fail to explain that behaviorists specifically focused on the causal processes linking stimuli to behaviors. The answer key requires explaining that behaviorists focused on 'the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior,' which the student does not address.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

Evolutionary psychologists take a functional perspective because they describe why things exist as they do based on their role in aiding human survival.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that evolutionary psychologists adopt a functional perspective, which corresponds to the design stance in Dennett's framework. They accurately explain that this involves understanding psychological processes in terms of their adaptive function and role in survival, which aligns with the answer key's emphasis on considering processes in terms of their function.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Uniqueness: B occurs exclusively as a result of A. Reliability: Whenever B occurs, A invariably occurs as well. Credibility: It is reasonable to believe that A causes B. Temporal and spatial proximity: A and B occur near each other in time and location. Resemblance between cause and effect: The cause A closely resembles the effect B.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the concept of distinctness/specificity using 'uniqueness' - that B occurs exclusively as a result of A captures the same meaning.
- Incorrect: The student describes reliability as 'whenever B occurs, A invariably occurs as well' which is backwards - consistency means whenever A occurs, B follows, not the reverse.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies plausibility using 'credibility' - stating it's reasonable to believe A causes B captures the common sense aspect of plausibility.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies contiguity in time and space as 'temporal and spatial proximity' - A and B occurring near each other in time and location matches the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies similarity in cause and effect as 'resemblance between cause and effect' - stating the cause closely resembles the effect captures this heuristic accurately.

Score: 0.8

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

The two biases involved are the negativity bias and the availability heuristic. The negativity bias causes us to focus on emotionally negative information, such as people expressing moral outrage. As a result, we encounter negative information more frequently, making it more memorable. Then, through the availability heuristic, we assess how common morally outraged individuals are based on how readily examples come to mind, leading us to overestimate their prevalence.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias and explains it as the tendency to focus on emotionally negative information, which aligns with the answer key's description of seeking out or placing more weight on negative information like morally outraged content.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the availability heuristic and explains it as assessing frequency based on how readily examples come to mind, which matches the answer key's definition of estimating frequency based on ease of recall.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of how the two biases work together - negativity bias makes negative content more memorable and frequently encountered, which then leads the availability heuristic to cause overestimation of moral outrage prevalence. This captures the causal relationship described in the answer key.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

Framework theories are wide-ranging ideas about how the world functions, derived from general understanding. We often transfer general knowledge from one area to another. Here, our understanding of virology affects how we behave socially.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that biological knowledge about contagion/virology is being transferred to social behavior, which matches the answer key's point about biological domain concepts being applied to the social domain.

Score: 1.0

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

Whether a conspiracy theory is seen as delusional or not depends on the social environment. If most people around an individual accept the theory, it is viewed as non-delusional; if most people reject it, the theory is regarded as delusional.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student only addresses the social acceptance criterion but omits the essential requirement that a delusional conspiracy theory must also be an irrational belief. The answer key specifies both conditions must be met: irrationality AND lack of common acceptance.

Score: 0.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

You tend to be more prone to conspiratorial thinking if you perceive patterns in random events, have lower intelligence, and possess narcissistic traits.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'perceiving patterns in random events' which matches 'seeing patterns in randomness' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'lower intelligence' which directly corresponds to 'having a low level of intelligence' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'narcissistic traits' which matches 'being narcissistic' from the answer key.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Source amnesia leads to confusion because we recall encountering information, such as the wrong answer, but forget the context or whether it was accurate. Additionally, when we process information presented to us, like the incorrect answer displayed on the screen, we tend to accept it automatically. As a result, the wrong answer can continue to influence us even after we have previously recognized it as incorrect.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies source amnesia as the key mechanism and accurately explains how it works - forgetting the context that an answer was incorrect while remembering the answer itself. The explanation of automatic processing and continued influence aligns well with the psychological concepts in the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

Politicians use the mere exposure effect to increase the attractiveness of their message. This effect occurs when individuals develop a greater preference for something simply because they have encountered it multiple times.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the mere exposure effect as the psychological mechanism and accurately explains that it involves developing greater preference for things encountered multiple times, which directly matches the answer key's explanation of mere exposure as the tendency to prefer familiar things.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Individuals with major depressive disorder tend to have a more realistic expectation that negative events will occur, as they do not possess the positivity bias commonly found in healthy individuals.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people with major depressive disorder are more accurate at predicting negative events because they lack the optimism bias that non-depressed individuals typically have, which aligns with the answer key's point about reduced overly optimistic tendencies leading to greater accuracy.

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

As sensory information becomes less reliable, perception shifts more toward prior beliefs. The weight of prior beliefs grows stronger compared to sensory input.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when sensory information becomes less reliable, prior beliefs have increased influence on perception, with the weight of prior beliefs growing stronger relative to sensory input. This directly matches the answer key's requirement.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

The first stage is the preconventional level, where individuals behave morally solely to gain rewards or avoid punishment. Next is the conventional level, where moral actions are guided by social norms and expectations. Finally, the postconventional level involves acting morally based on a profound comprehension of morality, recognizing that moral principles can sometimes be in conflict.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the preconventional level as focusing on gaining rewards or avoiding punishment, which matches the answer key's description of obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as being guided by social norms and expectations, which aligns with the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly describes the postconventional level as involving a profound comprehension of morality and recognizing moral principles, which corresponds to the answer key's focus on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model is a method we use to explain cause-and-effect relationships for past events and develop a narrative based on them. Once such models are formed, past events appear more predetermined than they actually were.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a causal model explains cause-and-effect relationships for past events and develops a narrative, which aligns with the answer key's description of a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student accurately describes how causal models contribute to hindsight bias by making past events appear 'more predetermined than they actually were,' which matches the answer key's point about events seeming more inevitable than they were.

Score: 1.0

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Once we find out that an event occurred, our recollections of how likely we believed it was are distorted by the knowledge that it actually happened. As a result, we tend to overstate how probable we thought the event was and insist that we anticipated it from the beginning.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly explains that learning new information (finding out an event occurred) distorts our recollections of past likelihood judgments, leading us to overestimate how probable we previously thought the event was. This demonstrates understanding that newly acquired knowledge cannot be avoided when estimating past judgments, which is the core mechanism described in the answer key.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing involves striving to choose the best option available, while satisficing means settling for a decision that is sufficiently good. The maximizing decision style is associated with the personality trait of neuroticism.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines maximizing as 'striving to choose the best option available,' which aligns with the answer key's definition of 'trying to make the best choice.'
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as 'settling for a decision that is sufficiently good,' which matches the answer key's definition of 'making a good-enough choice.'
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that 'the maximizing decision style is associated with the personality trait of neuroticism,' which directly corresponds to the answer key's requirement about high neuroticism leading to maximizing behavior.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

One approach could be to establish a set of clear, predefined guidelines and criteria for assignments in the course. Students are likely to adhere to these instructions closely, as following rules is often seen as the right thing to do, prompting them to engage with the key concepts covered in the material. If the rules are well-defined, the professor can quickly review the assignments to determine if the students met the requirements, making it easier to decide on passing or failing. However, imposing rigid rules may limit students' freedom and chances for creativity.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement with the question by proposing a concrete solution (predefined guidelines and criteria) that addresses the constraint of limited time and resources. They show understanding of both the benefits (quick grading, clear expectations that promote engagement) and potential drawbacks (limited creativity) of their approach, indicating thoughtful consideration of the trade-offs involved in course design.
