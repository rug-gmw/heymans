Grade: 6.5

## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidtâ€™s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

Describing this model using System 1 and System 2, moral judgments are not the result of System 2's rational thought processes. Instead, they stem from System 1, as moral decisions arise from intuition and gut feelings. According to this theory, System 1 plays the primary role.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 is associated with intuition and gut feelings, which aligns with the answer key's requirement that System 1 refers to intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 2 involves rational thought processes, which matches the answer key's requirement that System 2 refers to reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student clearly states that 'System 1 plays the primary role' and that moral judgments stem from System 1 rather than System 2's rational processes, correctly identifying System 1 as dominant.

Score: 1.0

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

- The representativeness heuristic highlights the stated assumption. - The representativeness heuristic is a cognitive shortcut that causes mistakes in reasoning by making people judge an object or person (here, our colleague) based on how closely they resemble the typical example of a category (in this case, fashion models).

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process, though uses 'highlights' instead of 'underlies' - the core identification is accurate.
- Correct: The student provides a clear and accurate explanation of the representativeness heuristic, correctly describing how it involves judging category membership based on resemblance to typical examples, and properly applies it to the specific scenario.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

- Anchoring refers to holding an initial belief or value that affects how we interpret subsequent information. - The primacy effect means that the first information we receive about a person or situation significantly shapes our overall judgment of that person or situation. - Both concepts share the idea that early information influences how we process and rely on new information that follows.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as holding an initial belief/value that affects interpretation of subsequent information, which captures the essence of taking the first piece of information as a starting point.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as first information significantly shaping overall judgment, which aligns with the tendency to better remember first information and its influence on decision-making.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both concepts involve early information influencing how we process new information, which demonstrates understanding of their common overreliance on first information.

Score: 1.0

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to people's stronger motivation to avoid losses compared to their desire to achieve gains. Risk aversion describes people's preference for more certain options over uncertain ones that involve the possibility of loss.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves people being more motivated to avoid losses than to achieve gains, which accurately captures the concept of weighing losses more heavily than equivalent gains.
- Correct: The student correctly describes risk aversion as preferring more certain options over uncertain ones, which aligns with the answer key's definition of preferring certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 1.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias is the tendency for people to exaggerate how they will feel about future events, overestimating both the duration and intensity of their emotions. This bias can discourage individuals from ending relationships because they anticipate feeling extremely sad and miserable for a prolonged period after the breakup.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies impact bias as overestimating emotional reactions to future events, mentioning both intensity and duration which demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the concept.
- Correct: The student correctly explains that impact bias prevents breakups by making people anticipate feeling 'extremely sad and miserable for a prolonged period,' which clearly shows understanding of how overestimating negative emotions discourages relationship ending.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting refers to people's capacity to anticipate their future emotional reactions to events. Taking affective forecasting into account in end-of-life decisions is crucial because individuals often have biased expectations about their future feelings.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies affective forecasting as the capacity to anticipate future emotional reactions, which aligns with the answer key's definition of predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Incorrect: While the student mentions biased expectations about future feelings, they do not specifically address the key example from the answer key about healthy people predicting they'd prefer to die when sick, but then not actually preferring to die when they become sick.

Score: 0.5

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

Prospect theory suggests that individuals tend to overvalue small probabilities. The distinction between moderately low probabilities (such as 10%) and very low probabilities (like 0.01%) lies in the decision weight assigned to each. However, overall, both types of probabilities are perceived as more likely than they actually are according to this theory.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that low probabilities like 10% are overestimated, stating that 'small probabilities' are 'overvalued' and 'perceived as more likely than they actually are.'
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly claims that extremely low probabilities (0.01%) are also overestimated, whereas the answer key indicates they are treated as impossibilities rather than being overweighted.

Score: 0.5

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion reflects a stronger emotional impact from losses (with a greater desire to avoid them) compared to gains, which are valued less intensely (with less motivation to pursue them). In other words, the utility assigned to avoiding losses is higher than that of obtaining gains.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion means losses have a stronger impact than gains, and that utilities are assigned differently to losses versus gains. While the language focuses more on emotional impact and motivation rather than technical utility weighting, the core concept that losses are weighted more heavily than gains is clearly present.

Score: 1.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory suggests that the most rational choice between two options is to select the one with the highest expected financial value over the long term. In contrast, Expected Utility Theory focuses not on maximizing monetary value but on maximizing personal expected value by taking into account an individual's preferences and desires alongside financial outcomes. It is also applied when decisions involve uncertainty or risk, situations where expected value theory is not typically used.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory focuses on financial/monetary value while expected utility theory considers personal preferences and non-financial factors beyond just monetary outcomes.
- Incorrect: The student mentions that expected utility theory is applied in situations with uncertainty or risk where expected value theory is not used, but fails to specifically address risk aversion or the heuristics and biases aspect that distinguishes the two theories.

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesnâ€™t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Maximizing involves selecting the best possible choice, while satisfying means opting for an option that is good enough. Expected value theory focuses on picking the choice with the highest long-term value, whereas expected utility theory aims to maximize individual satisfaction.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes maximizing vs satisficing concepts instead of expected value theory. They don't mention probabilities, financial outcomes, or the normative nature of the model.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected utility theory as maximizing individual satisfaction, which aligns with the subjective utility concept, though they don't mention probabilities or outcomes structure.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention multi-attribute utility theory at all in their response.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention prospect theory at all in their response.

Score: 0.25

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease peopleâ€™s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Loss aversion influences how risk-averse people are based on their desire to avoid losses. When the motivation to avoid losses is strong, individuals tend to be less risk-averse and may even take more risks. Conversely, when loss aversion is low, people are generally more risk-averse.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion can decrease risk aversion and make people more willing to take risks to avoid losses. However, the second part about low loss aversion leading to more risk aversion is incorrect - this reverses the typical relationship. Despite this error, the core concept that loss aversion can reduce risk aversion is captured.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

- Conditioning is a method of learning that relies on forming associations. - Classical conditioning involves learning by linking two events that occur together. - Operant conditioning is learning through the use of rewards or punishments.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as a learning method based on forming associations, which aligns with the answer key's concept of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as learning by linking two events that occur together, which matches the answer key's description of associating things that happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning through rewards or punishments, which corresponds to the answer key's description of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

- Illusory causation is the mistaken belief that one event (event A) directly causes another event (event B), even though this is not the case. - Illusory correlation is the incorrect belief that two events, A and B, are related or move together (such that if one increases, the other does too), when in reality they are not connected.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly distinguishes between illusory causation (mistakenly believing one event causes another when it doesn't) and illusory correlation (incorrectly perceiving a relationship between two unrelated variables). The explanation captures the key difference that illusory causation involves misinterpreting causality while illusory correlation involves perceiving non-existent correlations.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to â€˜properlyâ€™ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

- A schema refers to the idea that individuals should comprehend the functioning of the Dutch healthcare system. It serves as a framework of information or knowledge about how the health system operates. - A script involves the expected behavior at a birthday party. It represents a sequence of events and outlines the typical order in which things occur.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the Dutch healthcare system as a schema and provides an appropriate explanation that it serves as a framework of knowledge about how the system operates, which aligns with the answer key's emphasis on knowledge and relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies birthday party behavior as a script and explains it as a sequence of events in typical order, which captures the essence of a script as behavioral expectations in a specific situation, consistent with the answer key.

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

This perspective takes the physical stance, interpreting behavior through mechanical or physical terms, as it suggests that the mind can be quantified.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly identifies the physical stance but provides an incorrect justification. The student states behaviorists believed 'the mind can be quantified,' which contradicts the question premise that behaviorists emphasized the mind 'could not be measured.' The correct reasoning is that behaviorists focused on stimulus-response processes, not mind quantification.

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

The design stance is the approach taken by evolutionary psychologists in this example, focusing on how the theory functions in relation to behavior and viewing psychological processes based on their evolutionary usefulness.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance and provides an accurate explanation that they focus on function and evolutionary usefulness of psychological processes, which aligns with the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

- Causality refers to the idea that event A consistently occurs before or simultaneously with event B, leading us to believe that A causes B.  
- Regarding causality in terms of time and space, if A and B occur at the same time or place, they are often seen as having a causal connection.  
- Temporal precedence suggests that if A happens prior to B, we assume A causes B rather than the reverse.  
- Distinctiveness -

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions 'distinctiveness' but does not provide an explanation. The answer key requires distinctness/specificity to be explained as B following A but not other events.
- Incorrect: The student describes causality in general terms about consistency but does not specifically identify 'consistency' as a separate heuristic with the explanation that B always follows A.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention plausibility as a heuristic, which requires common sense to make the causal relationship believable.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies contiguity in time and space, explaining that A and B occurring at the same time or place suggests causal connection.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention similarity in cause and effect as a heuristic, which involves superficial resemblance between A and B.

Score: 0.2

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Availability bias occurs because our minds tend to focus on the most readily accessible information about morally outraged behavior, causing us to overestimate how frequently it occurs. Representative bias can also play a role; if we have a mental category of how morally outraged individuals appear and act, seeing someone on social media who fits this category may lead us to assume they are representative of the whole group, which also results in overestimating the prevalence of morally outraged behavior.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions 'availability bias' which is close to the availability heuristic, but does not mention the negativity bias at all, which is one of the two primary biases asked for in the question.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies and explains the availability heuristic (though they call it 'availability bias'), describing how readily accessible information leads to overestimation of frequency.
- Incorrect: The student does not explain the connection between negativity bias and availability heuristic. Instead, they discuss representative bias, which is not part of the answer key's explanation of how these two biases work together.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

According to illusory framework theories, which refer to common-sense knowledge people use to understand the world, different domains of knowledge apply as follows: in the physical domain, one might describe a T-shirt as dirty and unattractive; in the biological domain, the T-shirt could be seen as harboring bacteria and germs; and in the psychological domain, the T-shirt might be linked to the negative qualities of the person who owns it, which we would prefer not to be associated with ourselves.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that biological domain concepts (bacteria, germs, contagion) are being inappropriately applied to the psychological/social domain when avoiding items belonging to disliked people, which matches the answer key's requirement about incorrect cross-domain application of contagion concepts.

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

Delusional conspiracy theories include supernatural and spiritual elements, whereas non-delusional theories do not rely on these kinds of explanations.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies supernatural/spiritual elements as the distinguishing factor. The answer key specifies that the distinction is based on whether the theory is both irrational AND not commonly accepted, not on the presence of supernatural elements.

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

- Limited education - Possessing a lower socioeconomic status - Mental misconceptions - Thinking errors - Characteristics of neuroticism

Feedback:

- Incorrect: Limited education and lower socioeconomic status are not specifically mentioned in the answer key. While 'low level of intelligence' is in the key, education level is not the same concept.
- Incorrect: Mental misconceptions and thinking errors are too vague and don't match the specific cognitive factors listed in the answer key such as 'seeing patterns in randomness' or 'low level of analytical thinking'.
- Incorrect: Neuroticism is not listed among the personality factors in the answer key. The key specifically mentions narcissism and being male as personality/demographic factors.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you donâ€™t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

It may disrupt learning through anchoring because the original belief was considered correct, and even after discovering the true answer, we might continue to think the incorrect one is right.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions anchoring, which is not the correct psychological mechanism. The answer key requires source amnesia (forgetting the source/context of information), proactive interference, or the continued-influence effect. Anchoring refers to over-relying on the first piece of information encountered, which is different from forgetting that an answer was incorrect.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

The mechanism of availability and accessibility refers to how frequently repeated statements by politicians become more readily recalled in our minds, and through accessibility, we are able to bring these ideas into our conscious awareness.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies 'availability and accessibility' as the mechanism, when the correct answer is 'mere exposure effect' or 'illusory-truth effect'. The student appears to confuse the availability heuristic (already mentioned in the question) with the distinct psychological phenomenon that makes repeated statements more attractive through familiarity.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Yes, individuals with major depressive disorder are more likely to experience a negativity bias, leading them to anticipate negative outcomes more intensely and frequently. As a result, they may overestimate the likelihood of something bad happening to them, making their predictions less accurate compared to those without the disorder.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that people with major depressive disorder are less accurate at making predictions due to overestimating negative outcomes. The answer key indicates the opposite - that people with depression are actually more accurate because they show reduced optimism bias, not because they overestimate negative events.

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

As the reliability of sensory information diminishes, the impact of prior beliefs becomes stronger.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that as sensory information becomes less reliable, prior beliefs have a stronger/greater influence on perception, which directly matches the key concept from the answer key.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You donâ€™t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other peopleâ€™s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

Kohlberg identified three stages of moral development: Pre-conventional, where children base their moral choices on rewards and punishments; Conventional, where children consider the effects of their decisions on others and whether they align with social norms; and Post-conventional, where individuals evaluate morality based on universal principles and may choose actions that go against social rules if deemed morally justified at a higher level.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the Pre-conventional level as basing moral choices on rewards and punishments, which aligns with the answer key's description of focusing on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the Conventional level as considering effects on others and alignment with social norms, which matches the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly describes the Post-conventional level as evaluating morality based on universal principles and potentially going against social rules for higher moral justification, which aligns with the answer key's focus on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

- A causal model of past events involves identifying the factors that caused a particular event to occur. - Hindsight bias occurs when, after knowing the outcome, the mind attempts to make sense of it by searching for reasons or causes that explain how the outcome came about or what contributed to its occurrence.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes causal models as identifying factors that caused events, but misses the key concept that a causal model is a coherent narrative showing how past events are related to each other.
- Incorrect: The student explains hindsight bias as the mind searching for causes after knowing outcomes, but fails to connect this to how causal models make events seem more inevitable than they actually were, which is the specific mechanism contributing to hindsight bias.

Score: 0.0

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Once we have learned something, it's difficult not to keep thinking about it and to take it into account later on. In hindsight bias, after knowing the outcome, if we are asked to reassess the likelihood of that outcome, our prior knowledge of the result will affect our judgment because it's challenging to ignore or dismiss the information we have already acquired.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly explains that newly learned information (the outcome) cannot be avoided when making past likelihood judgments, which is the core mechanism of how learning contributes to hindsight bias. The answer demonstrates understanding that once we know an outcome, it's difficult to ignore this knowledge when trying to recall or estimate what we thought before learning it.

Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

- Maximizing involves selecting the very best option available. - Satisficing means opting for an option that is sufficiently good. - Individuals who score high in neuroticism tend to use a maximizing approach when making decisions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as selecting the very best option available, which aligns with the answer key's definition of trying to make the best choice.
- Correct: The student accurately defines satisficing as opting for an option that is sufficiently good, which matches the answer key's description of making a good-enough choice.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that individuals high in neuroticism tend to use a maximizing approach, which directly matches the answer key's expectation.

Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

To boost engagement, weekly quizzes on the material covered during the week could be introduced, with passing these quizzes required to qualify for the exam (quizzes could allow unlimited attempts). Another idea to increase involvement is for students to complete an assignment related to a lecture topic they find interesting; this task could be graded on a pass/fail basis and be mandatory for exam participation or, if done well, count for 10% of the exam grade. Starting the lecture with a Kahoot session during the first 10 minutes about the current or previous topic can also enhance student engagement and help them learn the material in an enjoyable way, improving retention.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement by proposing multiple concrete strategies that address the constraint of limited time/resources while promoting active engagement. The suggestions include automated quizzes with unlimited attempts (reducing grading burden), pass/fail assignments (minimizing time-intensive feedback), and Kahoot sessions (interactive but requiring minimal preparation). The answer shows thoughtful consideration of both engagement goals and practical limitations.
