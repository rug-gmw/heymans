## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

The social intuitionist model integrates moral judgment with rational thought. Moral judgment is linked to system 1 thinking, as moral values arise quickly and effortlessly through intuition. In contrast, rational reasoning corresponds to system 2, involving slow and deliberate decision-making. Within this model, system 1 plays a more prominent role.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 thinking is linked to intuition in moral judgment, stating that 'moral values arise quickly and effortlessly through intuition.'
- Correct: The student accurately describes System 2 as involving 'rational reasoning' and 'slow and deliberate decision-making,' which aligns with the answer key's reference to reasoning/rational thought.
- Correct: The student correctly states that 'system 1 plays a more prominent role,' indicating they understand System 1 is dominant in Haidt's model.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

Representativeness heuristic refers to the tendency to classify someone into a particular group, such as a fashion model, based on a specific characteristic or their physical look.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process in this scenario.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of the heuristic by explaining that it involves classifying someone into a group based on physical characteristics, which aligns with the concept of judging likelihood based on resemblance to stereotypes.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring involves presenting specific information first, which then acts as a reference point for evaluating subsequent information. Primacy refers to sharing information early on with the intention that it will be remembered more effectively. Both concepts share the idea that information provided at the start impacts later decisions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that anchoring involves using first information as a reference point, which aligns with the key point about taking first information as a starting point.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as information shared early being remembered more effectively, which matches the answer key's definition of better remembering first information.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both concepts share the common feature of first/early information impacting later processes (decisions/memory), which corresponds to overreliance on first information.

Score: 1.0

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the preference for certainty to avoid uncertainty. Risk aversion involves a desire to avoid risks altogether and thus steer clear of risky situations. The difference lies in that risk aversion avoids all risky scenarios, whereas loss aversion only avoids situations where losses are more probable than gains, while still participating in situations where the potential gains are definitely greater.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly defines loss aversion as 'preference for certainty to avoid uncertainty,' which is actually the definition of risk aversion. Loss aversion should refer to weighing losses more heavily than equivalent gains.
- Incorrect: The student's definition of risk aversion as 'desire to avoid risks altogether' is too extreme and inaccurate. Risk aversion refers to preferring certainty over uncertainty, not avoiding all risks entirely.

Score: 0.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias refers to the tendency to exaggerate the intensity of future emotions regarding a specific event. This can stop individuals from ending relationships, as they often overpredict how bad they will feel after a breakup, causing them to stay in an unhappy partnership.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as the tendency to exaggerate the intensity of future emotions, which captures the essence of overestimating the impact of future events on feelings.
- Correct: The student accurately explains how impact bias prevents breakups by stating that people overpredict how bad they will feel after a breakup, which directly matches the answer key's explanation.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting refers to our expectations about how we will feel in the future. It plays a crucial role in end-of-life decision-making since we often anticipate our future feelings to be worse than they really are, which can complicate evaluating these decisions because the future might be less bleak than we imagine.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines affective forecasting as predictions about future emotional states, using slightly different wording ('expectations about how we will feel') but capturing the same concept.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of the key insight that people's predictions about their future preferences may differ from their actual preferences when the situation occurs, though they frame it more generally about anticipating worse feelings rather than the specific healthy-to-sick preference shift.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

People tend to overestimate unlikely events. When relying on mental shortcuts, individuals use heuristics and biases to assess probabilities, which can lead to inaccurate or rushed judgments. Extremely low probabilities are often perceived as less likely because people are more prone to underestimate absolute values compared to relative ones.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people overestimate unlikely events, which aligns with the answer key point about merely low probabilities being overestimated.
- Incorrect: The student states that extremely low probabilities are perceived as 'less likely' and underestimated, which contradicts the answer key point that extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities (which would be a form of overestimation of their unlikeliness).

Score: 0.5

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

The likelihood of experiencing a gain or a loss. Because loss aversion favors certainty instead of ambiguity, the chance of avoiding a loss is greater than the chance of pursuing a gain.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly describes loss aversion as being about likelihood/probability of gains and losses, and relates it to certainty vs ambiguity. Loss aversion in prospect theory specifically refers to the asymmetric weighting of utilities where losses are weighted more heavily than equivalent gains, not about probabilities or certainty preferences.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory focuses on financial outcomes, while expected utility theory may not always involve financial results and incorporates heuristics and biases, which expected value theory does not.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory focuses on financial outcomes while expected utility theory extends beyond just financial results, capturing the essence of the first key difference.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that expected utility theory incorporates heuristics and biases. According to the answer key, expected utility theory considers risk aversion, while it's expected value theory that does not consider heuristics and biases.

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

1. Expected value theory is a descriptive model that bases decisions on financial outcomes. 2. Expected utility theory is similar to expected value theory but also accounts for heuristics and biases, and it is not limited to financial outcomes. 3. Multi-attribute utility theory is a descriptive model that evaluates various attributes, each assigned a weight reflecting their relative importance. 4. Prospect theory is a normative model that integrates elements of the previous theories, applying probability while incorporating heuristics and biases to guide decision-making.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies expected value theory as a descriptive model when it is actually a normative model. However, they correctly mention it involves financial outcomes and probabilities.
- Incorrect: The student confuses expected utility theory with prospect theory by saying it accounts for heuristics and biases, when expected utility theory is a normative model that simply extends expected value theory to non-financial utilities.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies multi-attribute utility theory as a descriptive model when it is actually a normative model. They do correctly mention multiple attributes and weights.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies prospect theory as a normative model when it is actually a descriptive (behavioral) model. They do correctly mention heuristics and biases, but confuse the normative/descriptive classification.

Score: 0.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Individuals who fear losses prefer to avoid losing anything in pursuit of gains, which leads them to avoid taking risks.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that loss aversion leads people to avoid taking risks. According to the answer key, loss aversion actually decreases risk aversion and can make people risk-seeking when trying to avoid potential losses, which is the opposite of what the student described.

Score: 0.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves linking two events together. Classical conditioning is the process of learning to connect things by their simultaneous occurrence, while operant conditioning involves learning associations through consequences like rewards and punishments.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as involving associations/connections between events, which aligns with the key concept of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as learning to connect things through simultaneous occurrence, which matches the answer key's description of associating things that happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning through consequences like rewards and punishments, which directly corresponds to the answer key's definition of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory correlation occurs when people think two events are related simply because they occur simultaneously, even though no actual connection exists. Illusory causation is the mistaken belief that one event causes another just because they happen in close sequence.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student confuses the definitions. They describe illusory correlation as perceiving a relationship due to simultaneous occurrence, which is closer to illusory causation. They describe illusory causation as mistaking sequence for causation, but miss that illusory causation specifically involves misinterpreting an existing correlation as causation, while illusory correlation involves perceiving correlation where none actually exists.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

Schema involves understanding the functioning of the Dutch healthcare system, focusing on rules rather than cultural elements. In contrast, a script refers to appropriate behavior at a birthday party, relying on cultural norms to evaluate the situation.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that understanding the Dutch healthcare system is a schema and provides a reasonable explanation that it involves understanding functioning and rules, which aligns with schemas being knowledge structures about relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that behavior at a birthday party is a script and appropriately explains that it involves cultural norms for situational behavior, which matches the concept of scripts as social schemas for specific situations.

Score: 1.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

The intentional stance arises from people's deliberate desire to observe and evaluate behavior.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the intentional stance instead of the physical stance. The answer also misunderstands behaviorism by suggesting it involves deliberate desire to observe behavior, when behaviorism actually focused on stimulus-response mechanisms and rejected mentalistic explanations, which aligns with the physical stance that explains behavior through mechanical processes.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

The degree of functionality (though the precise level is unclear, it was indicated as functional in the lecture slides) is accepted because evolutionary psychologists argue that specific abilities in humans and animals are essential for survival. Traits that support survival contribute to this process.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student discusses functionality and survival traits but fails to identify the specific stance (design stance) that evolutionary psychologists adopt according to Dennett's framework. The answer is too vague and doesn't demonstrate understanding of Dennett's levels of analysis.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

1. Availability heuristic: if event A easily comes to mind, we tend to believe event B is related to it. 2. Representativeness heuristic: if event A belongs to a certain category, event B is often assumed to be connected to A if they share similar traits. 3. Illusory correlation: mistakenly believing that two events are connected when they actually are not. 4. Recency/primacy: when event A is mentioned first followed by event B, they are often seen as linked. 5. Anchoring and adjusting: when event A serves as an initial reference point, it influences how we evaluate subsequent events like event B, leading to an assumed correlation.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: Student describes availability heuristic instead of distinctness/specificity. The answer key requires explaining that A likely causes B when B follows A but not other events.
- Incorrect: Student describes representativeness heuristic instead of consistency. The answer key requires explaining that A likely causes B when B always follows A.
- Incorrect: Student describes illusory correlation instead of plausibility. The answer key requires explaining that A likely causes B when common sense makes it plausible.
- Incorrect: Student describes recency/primacy effects instead of contiguity in time and space. The answer key requires explaining that A likely causes B when they occur at the same time and location.
- Incorrect: Student describes anchoring and adjusting instead of similarity in cause and effect. The answer key requires explaining that A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Confirmation bias occurs because we usually seek out information that supports our existing beliefs while ignoring evidence that contradicts them. Positivity bias leads us to overrate our own skill in finding accurate information. These biases interact because we hold an overly favorable opinion of ourselves and therefore focus only on information that reinforces this positive self-image, especially regarding others who express moral outrage.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student identifies confirmation bias instead of negativity bias. While confirmation bias involves seeking information that supports existing beliefs, the answer key specifically requires negativity bias - the tendency to seek out or place more weight on negative information like morally outraged content.
- Incorrect: The student identifies positivity bias instead of availability heuristic. Positivity bias relates to overrating one's own abilities, while the answer key requires availability heuristic - estimating frequency based on how easily examples come to mind.
- Incorrect: The student's explanation of how the biases interact focuses on self-image reinforcement rather than the correct mechanism. The answer key requires explaining how negativity bias increases attention to moral outrage content, which then leads availability heuristic to cause overestimation of moral outrage frequency.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

Framework theories are general, intuitive understandings of how things function in the world. Applying these broad concepts to specific areas of knowledge can result in superstitions, as general ideas are mistakenly used to explain particular facts. For instance, wearing glasses like Steve Jobs does not guarantee that someone will become a successful tech innovator.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that framework theories from one domain (biological contagion) are being misapplied to another domain (social/cultural), which explains the magical thinking. The Steve Jobs glasses example effectively illustrates how contagion concepts are incorrectly transferred from biological to social domains.

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

Delusional conspiracy theories rely mainly on personal interpretations, while non-delusional conspiracies contain a core truth that is supplemented with subjective information.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly focuses on personal interpretations versus core truth, missing the key distinction that delusional conspiracy theories are both irrational beliefs AND not commonly accepted, while non-delusional ones fail to meet both criteria.

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

1. act like a man 2. display narcissistic behavior 3. often provide overly simplistic explanations for complicated situations

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'being a man' as one of the cognitive/personality factors contributing to conspiratorial thinking from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies narcissistic behavior, which matches 'being narcissistic' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies providing overly simplistic explanations for complicated situations, which matches 'believing in simple explanations for complex events' from the answer key.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Anchoring and adjustment occur when an initial incorrect answer serves as a reference point, causing you to later modify your response and provide the correct answer based on new information.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes anchoring and adjustment, which is about using an initial value as a reference point for subsequent judgments. However, this doesn't address how incorrect answers interfere with learning. The answer key requires explaining mechanisms like source amnesia (forgetting the answer was incorrect), proactive interference (old incorrect info interfering with new correct info), or continued-influence effect. The student's answer describes adjustment toward correct answers rather than interference with learning.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

The tendency to develop a preference for things simply because they are familiar.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the mere exposure effect, which is the psychological mechanism where familiarity breeds preference. This directly matches the answer key's description of mere exposure as 'the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with.'

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

No, they tend to focus more on negative aspects.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly identifies that people with major depressive disorder do not make less accurate predictions, but fails to explain that they are actually MORE accurate due to reduced optimism bias. The answer about 'focusing on negative aspects' doesn't address the key concept of accuracy in probability judgments.

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

As sensory information becomes less reliable, greater reliance is placed on prior beliefs. This implies that expectations about specific situations will carry more influence in making perceptual decisions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when sensory information becomes less reliable, prior beliefs have greater influence on perception. The answer demonstrates understanding that expectations play a larger role in perceptual decisions under conditions of unreliable sensory input, which aligns with the key concept from the answer key.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

1. Preconventional: individuals are self-centered, behaving well to gain rewards and avoiding wrongdoing to prevent punishment. 2. Conventional: people consider others' feelings and show respect for authority figures. 3. Post-conventional: understanding that differing moral values can lead to conflicts and embracing universal ethical principles.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the preconventional level as focusing on rewards and avoiding punishment, which matches the answer key's description of obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as considering others' feelings and respecting authority, which aligns with the answer key's emphasis on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the post-conventional level as involving universal ethical principles, which matches the answer key's description of focusing on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model is the assumption that one event follows another. This leads to hindsight bias because we tend to believe we always knew the sequence of these events would occur.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student defines a causal model too simplistically as just 'one event follows another' rather than as a coherent narrative explaining how past events are related. This misses the comprehensive, explanatory nature of causal models.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that causal models contribute to hindsight bias by making us believe we 'always knew' events would occur, which captures the essence of how causal models make past events seem more inevitable than they actually were.

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Hindsight bias is the inclination to believe that you predicted an outcome after learning the new information, making it seem as though you knew it all along.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student defines hindsight bias but does not explain how learning contributes to it. The answer key requires explaining that newly learned information cannot be avoided when estimating past likelihood judgments, but the student only describes what hindsight bias is rather than the mechanism by which learning causes it.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing involves seeking the best possible choice, while satisficing means settling for a decision that is sufficiently good. Individuals with a neurotic personality tend to use a maximizing approach to decision-making.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as seeking the best possible choice, which aligns with the answer key's definition of 'trying to make the best choice.'
- Correct: The student accurately defines satisficing as settling for a decision that is sufficiently good, which matches the answer key's 'making a good-enough choice.'
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that individuals with a neurotic personality tend to use a maximizing approach, which corresponds to the answer key's statement about high neuroticism being linked to maximizing decision style.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

Using AI could be a reasonable choice, but it largely depends on how the AI evaluates the answers. At university, it is frequently emphasized that while AI can be helpful, it is not perfect and can often make mistakes. Relying on AI for grading might lead to correct answers being marked wrong and incorrect ones being marked right. However, if the grading system is thoroughly tested—which is unlikely given constraints on time and resources—it could serve as an effective way to actively engage with the material during an exam.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement with the question by considering AI as a potential solution while critically analyzing its limitations and practical constraints. They acknowledge both benefits (efficiency for large classes) and drawbacks (potential grading errors), and recognize the tension between thorough testing and resource limitations. This thoughtful consideration of trade-offs shows genuine reflection on the pedagogical challenge presented.
