## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

Haidt's social-intuitionist model of moral judgment emphasizes the role of moral intuition. It suggests that moral judgments originate from immediate gut feelings (System 1, the intuitive, emotional process), which are later influenced by reasoning (System 2, the reflective, analytical process). In the example Haidt provides—two brothers having sex using a condom and contraception—this situation triggers a strong intuitive taboo against incest, meaning System 1 plays a more dominant role.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies System 1 as the intuitive, emotional process that generates immediate gut feelings, which aligns with the answer key's description of System 1 as intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student accurately describes System 2 as the reflective, analytical process involving reasoning, which matches the answer key's description of System 2 as reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student clearly states that System 1 plays a more dominant role, providing a specific example (incest taboo) to illustrate this dominance, which satisfies the answer key requirement that System 1 is more dominant than System 2.

Score: 1.0

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

This is about the representativeness heuristic, which involves estimating the likelihood of something fitting into a category based on how closely it resembles the typical members of that category. For instance, if our colleague is as attractive as models usually are, we are likely to link her with real models, even though she isn't actually one.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process in this scenario.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that the representativeness heuristic involves estimating likelihood of category membership based on resemblance to typical category members, and provides a relevant example showing understanding of how appearance similarity leads to the assumption about being a fashion model.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring involves concentrating on a specific idea and using it as a foundation to build upon. The primacy effect refers to the tendency for people to better recall the first information they receive, often at the expense of information presented later. Both concepts share the emphasis on the initial or beginning phase.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as using a specific idea as a foundation, which aligns with taking the first piece of information as a starting point.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as the tendency to better recall first information received, which matches the answer key definition.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both concepts emphasize the initial/beginning phase, which corresponds to overreliance on first information.

Score: 1.0

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion occurs when individuals give greater importance to losses than to gains of the same size. Risk aversion is when people prefer options with more predictable outcomes over those with greater uncertainty.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves giving greater importance to losses than to gains of the same size, which matches the key concept that we weigh losses more heavily than gains.
- Correct: The student accurately describes risk aversion as preferring options with more predictable outcomes over those with greater uncertainty, which aligns with the preference for certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 1.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias occurs in affective forecasting, which involves predicting future emotions or mental states. This bias refers to people overestimating how intensely and for how long they will feel negative emotions after a future event. For example, individuals often avoid ending unhappy relationships because they exaggerate the amount of unhappiness and regret they expect to experience afterward. However, this overestimation is inaccurate, as demonstrated by the experiment conducted by Eastwick and colleagues discussed in the lecture.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as overestimating the intensity and duration of future emotions, which aligns with the answer key's definition of overestimating the impact of future events on future feelings.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that impact bias prevents breakups because people overestimate the negative emotions (unhappiness and regret) they would experience, which matches the answer key's point about overestimating how bad a breakup will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting refers to anticipating future emotions or mental states. Its influence on end-of-life choices can be illustrated by this example: when asked to choose between dying or living with a lifelong disability, a person may opt for death. However, when the actual moment of dying approaches, they often change their mind and reassess their earlier decision. This situation poses ethical challenges, especially for individuals who are no longer able to communicate, such as those suffering from Alzheimer’s disease.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines affective forecasting as anticipating future emotions or mental states, which aligns with the answer key's definition of predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Correct: The student provides a clear example that demonstrates the key concept: people may predict they would prefer death when facing disability, but change their mind when actually confronting the situation, which matches the answer key's point about healthy people predicting they'll prefer to die when sick but changing their preference when actually sick.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

Here, we concentrate on the key assumptions of prospect theory. First, individuals tend to overvalue small probabilities. As a result, relatively low probabilities (such as 10%) are perceived as more certain, whereas very tiny probabilities (like 0.01%) are viewed as completely uncertain.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that low probabilities like 10% are overestimated ('perceived as more certain'), which aligns with the answer key point about merely low probabilities being overestimated.
- Correct: The student correctly states that extremely low probabilities like 0.01% are 'viewed as completely uncertain,' which matches the answer key point about extremely low probabilities being interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

It centers on the concept of steering clear of risk, essentially preventing any confusion.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student answer describes risk avoidance and confusion prevention, which is completely unrelated to loss aversion in prospect theory. Loss aversion specifically refers to the asymmetric weighting of negative vs positive utilities (losses being weighted more heavily than gains), not general risk avoidance.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected utility theory emphasizes expected utility and its probability instead of expected value and probability, as seen in the expected-value theory. Additionally, expected utility theory incorporates a utility that is subjective rather than purely financial.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected utility theory deals with subjective utility rather than purely financial values, which aligns with the distinction between financial vs non-financial values in the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention risk aversion or heuristics and biases. They focus on the mathematical formulation difference (utility vs value) but miss the key behavioral aspect of risk aversion that distinguishes expected utility theory.

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

The four decision-making models are: expected value theory (a normative model), expected utility theory (a normative model), multiple-attributes utility theory (a normative model), and prospect theory (a behavioral descriptive model). Expected value theory involves choosing among options, each with a financial outcome and a probability. Expected utility theory also involves choosing among options with financial outcomes, but the utility is subjective rather than purely financial. Multiple-attributes utility theory deals with choosing between options that have several attributes, each assigned a utility and a weight. Lastly, prospect theory resembles expected utility theory but is descriptive instead of normative, incorporating biases and heuristics.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as a normative model involving choices between options with financial outcomes and probabilities.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that expected utility theory involves financial outcomes, when the key point is that outcomes have utility that doesn't need to be financial but can be subjective.
- Correct: The student correctly describes multi-attribute utility theory as involving options with multiple attributes, each having utility and weight.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies prospect theory as a descriptive/behavioral model similar to expected utility theory but incorporating heuristics and biases.

Score: 0.75

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Individuals tend to avoid risk by selecting options with lower uncertainty instead of those with higher uncertainty. The concept of loss aversion suggests that this behavior is driven by emotions rather than logical reasoning, as people prefer to steer clear of potential risks.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly describes loss aversion as making people more risk averse and focused on avoiding uncertainty. The answer key requires understanding that loss aversion actually decreases risk aversion and can make people risk-seeking when trying to avoid losses. The student's answer contradicts this key concept.

Score: 0.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves learning associations through the co-occurrence of events, leading to predictions grounded in previous experiences. It can be categorized into two types: classical and operant conditioning. Classical conditioning occurs when two stimuli happen together in the same time and place, forming a connection between them. Operant conditioning involves an event followed by a consequence, such as a reward or punishment.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as learning associations, mentioning co-occurrence of events and predictions from experiences, which aligns with the concept of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as occurring when two stimuli happen together in time and place, forming connections, which matches the answer key's description of associating things that happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as involving events followed by consequences like rewards or punishments, which aligns with the answer key's definition of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation occurs when we mistakenly believe that one event causes another, even though this is not the case. In contrast, illusory correlation happens when we assume that two things occur together and affect each other, despite this being untrue. For example, with mental health treatments, people may try various medications, some of which are ineffective or too weak, leading to the formation of illusory correlations.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student confuses the definitions. They describe illusory causation as mistakenly believing one event causes another (which is closer to illusory correlation), and describe illusory correlation as assuming two things occur together and affect each other (which implies causation). The correct distinction is that illusory causation involves misinterpreting an actual correlation as causal, while illusory correlation involves perceiving a correlation that doesn't actually exist.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

A schema provides the framework for understanding a situation and determining the appropriate way to respond. In contrast, a script is a type of social schema related to typical scenarios. Thus, I think that knowing how the Dutch healthcare system functions relates to a script because it is specific to that culture, whereas the correct behavior at a party is a schema since it goes beyond cultural factors.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the healthcare system as a script and provides faulty reasoning. Healthcare system knowledge is a schema because it involves understanding relationships and structures, not behavioral sequences.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies birthday party behavior as a schema, when it is actually a script. Scripts are behavioral sequences for specific situations, which birthday party etiquette clearly represents.

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

There are three types of analysis: the mechanical stance, the design stance, and the intentional stance. Because we are focusing on behaviorism, we will select the intentional stance, which relates to how individuals behave and their emotions. An example of the intentional stance is asking, "Why is your friend ignoring me?"

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the intentional stance as the behaviorist approach. Behaviorists actually adopted the physical stance because they focused on observable stimulus-response mechanisms rather than mental states or intentions. The student also misnames Dennett's stances (calling one 'mechanical' instead of 'physical') and misunderstands that behaviorism explicitly rejected studying emotions and mental states.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

Evolutionary psychologists would embrace the intentional stance because phenomena like ingroup favoritism depend on an emotional perspective.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the intentional stance instead of the design stance. Evolutionary psychology focuses on the functional purpose and adaptive value of psychological processes (design stance), not on beliefs and desires (intentional stance). The mention of 'emotional perspective' further misunderstands Dennett's framework.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

The five causal heuristics are: distinct (specific), consistent, plausible, contiguous in time and space, and similar in cause and effect. To illustrate them with examples from the lecture: distinct means that when I put my hand on my cat, she makes a unique sound that only happens with that action; consistent means that whenever I place my hand on my cat, she always makes that specific sound; plausible means, based on my knowledge of my cat's behavior, that putting my hand on her will cause that sound; contiguous in time and space means the effect happens as long as I physically touch my actual cat; and similarity in cause and effect, which isn’t related to the cat example, can be seen when moving my legs causes the ball to move during a game.

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies distinctness/specificity and provides a good example showing how the cat's unique sound only follows the specific action of placing hand on cat, not other events.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies consistency and demonstrates understanding with the example that the cat always makes the sound when the hand is placed on her.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies plausibility and shows understanding by explaining how common sense/knowledge of cat behavior makes the causal relationship believable.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies contiguity in time and space and demonstrates understanding by noting the effect happens when physically touching the actual cat (same time and location).
- Correct: Student correctly identifies similarity in cause and effect and provides an appropriate example with leg movement causing ball movement, showing understanding of superficial resemblance between cause and effect.

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

This discussion focuses on moral policing and negativity bias. Negativity bias causes people to be disproportionately affected by negative emotions, which leads them to view the world as more bleak than it truly is. Meanwhile, moral policing refers to the tendency of individuals to judge others harshly for mistakes, even if those mistakes are only perceived. As a result, this amplifies the negative view of the "accused," making them seem more culpable than they really are. Moral outrage, by definition, is the emotional response of anger triggered by perceived injustice.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions negativity bias but doesn't correctly define it as the tendency to seek out or place more weight on negative information. Instead, they describe it as being disproportionately affected by negative emotions.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention the availability heuristic at all, which is one of the two key biases identified in the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student does not explain the connection between the two biases and how they work together to cause overestimation of moral outrage on social media. They discuss moral policing instead, which is not part of the correct answer.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

The framework theory involves general, intuitive ideas about how the world works. When knowledge from one area is applied to another, superstitions often arise. One such superstition is Magical Contagion, which is the belief that using objects previously owned by someone disliked can transfer negative energy or traits from that person to the user.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that magical contagion involves applying knowledge from one domain (biological contagion - the idea that negative properties can be transferred through contact) to another domain (social/psychological - preferences about using objects based on previous ownership). The explanation captures the core concept that framework theories from different domains can be misapplied, leading to superstitious beliefs.

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

Delusions are unreasonable beliefs that are not supported by cultural norms. As a result, conspiracy theories that are not delusional are more likely to be true and gain broad acceptance, whereas delusional conspiracy theories tend to be seen as false and lack widespread acceptance.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that delusional conspiracy theories are unreasonable/irrational beliefs not supported by cultural norms (i.e., not commonly accepted), while non-delusional ones gain broader acceptance. This aligns with the answer key's distinction based on irrationality and lack of common acceptance.

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

Three elements related to conspiracy theories include emotional or personality aspects, existential concerns, and social influences.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions 'emotional or personality aspects' which is too vague and doesn't specifically identify any of the required factors like narcissism, low intelligence, or low analytical thinking.
- Incorrect: The student mentions 'existential concerns' which is not among the specific cognitive and personality factors listed in the answer key such as seeing patterns in randomness or believing in paranormal phenomena.
- Incorrect: The student mentions 'social influences' which is not one of the required cognitive and personality factors from the answer key that focus on individual psychological traits and thinking patterns.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

This demonstrates a continued influence effect, meaning that even after correcting the original misinformation, the incorrect information can still impact your preparation for future exams.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the continued-influence effect as the psychological mechanism, which is explicitly mentioned in the answer key as an acceptable general term for this phenomenon where incorrect information continues to influence thinking even after correction.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

These types of politicians often rely on the affect heuristic, emphasizing emotions over logic. For instance, populist leaders frequently incorporate fear into their rhetoric.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the affect heuristic as the mechanism, which relates to emotional decision-making rather than familiarity-based preference. The correct answer should identify mere exposure effect or illusory-truth effect, which explain how repetition increases attractiveness through familiarity.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

This refers to clinical predictions, which involve forecasting outcomes using subjective judgment and personal experience. Because these predictions rely on one’s internal perspective, individuals with major depressive disorder tend to be less accurate, lacking the positivity bias and often expecting negative events to occur.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that people with major depressive disorder are less accurate at making predictions about negative events. The answer key indicates that depressed individuals are actually more accurate because they have reduced optimism bias, while the student claims they are less accurate due to expecting negative events to occur.

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

When sensory information becomes less reliable, we tend to rely more on our existing beliefs, allowing them to guide and affect how we perceive the present.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when sensory information becomes less reliable, prior beliefs have increased influence on perception. The answer captures the key concept that unreliable sensory input leads to greater reliance on existing beliefs/expectations in shaping perception.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

The three phases of moral development include: pre-conventional, which centers on the notion that rewards are positive and punishments negative, emphasizing personal benefit and limited reciprocity; conventional, which emphasizes maintaining a good image before the law and others, as well as considering others' feelings; and post-conventional, which highlights the recognition that values may conflict and stresses the importance of embracing universal moral principles.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the pre-conventional level and accurately describes it as focusing on rewards being positive and punishments negative, which aligns with avoiding punishment and gaining rewards from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the conventional level and accurately describes it as emphasizing maintaining a good image and considering others' feelings, which matches the focus on social norms and other people's feelings from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the post-conventional level and accurately describes it as embracing universal moral principles, which aligns with the focus on abstract principles and values from the answer key.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

When attempting to remember past probabilities, it is simpler to create cause-and-effect stories for events that actually occurred than for those that were merely possible.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student does not define what a causal model is. They describe a process related to creating cause-and-effect stories but don't explain that a causal model is a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that creating cause-and-effect stories for events that actually occurred (versus those that were merely possible) relates to hindsight bias, though they don't explicitly use the term 'inevitable.'

Score: 0.5

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

As you attempt to remember previous likelihood assessments, new information continues to come in.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that newly acquired information interferes with recalling past likelihood judgments, which is the core mechanism of how learning contributes to hindsight bias.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Simon Herbert identified two types of decision-making styles: maximizing and satisficing. Maximizing involves seeking the absolute best choice among all possibilities, whereas satisficing means settling for an option that is simply good enough, often the first acceptable one encountered. Individuals who score high in neuroticism tend to favor the maximizing approach.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as seeking the absolute best choice among all possibilities, which aligns with the answer key's description of 'trying to make the best choice.'
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as settling for an option that is good enough, which matches the answer key's description of 'making a good-enough choice.'
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that individuals high in neuroticism tend to favor the maximizing approach, which directly matches the answer key.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

I believe that part of the approach used in this course is effective for handling such situations. For instance, the intermediate "Feedback assignment" allowed us to both give and receive feedback from our peers, which helped reduce overconfidence bias. This made the course more engaging by nearly doubling our initial team size, giving us the chance to connect with other participants and reconsider our views on the material. However, I wasn’t comfortable with the idea of the exam being graded by AI, possibly because I wasn’t clear on the criteria the AI used for grading. This uncertainty might have triggered confirmation bias, leading me to think the AI made an error rather than questioning my own answers. I think a more detailed explanation of the AI grading process would have been helpful. Alternatively, other methods like a final project or presentation could have replaced the exam. Additionally, I feel feedback mechanisms for the instructor are important; for example, during lectures, incorporating quizzes that ask "How do you feel about this topic?" and displaying anonymous student responses on the board could be very effective.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement with the question by drawing from course experiences, reflecting on their own learning process, identifying specific biases (overconfidence bias, confirmation bias), and proposing concrete solutions including peer feedback systems, AI grading transparency, alternative assessment methods, and real-time feedback mechanisms during lectures. The response shows thoughtful consideration of both challenges and practical approaches to engaging students with limited resources.
