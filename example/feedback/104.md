## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidtâ€™s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

The social intuitionist model suggests that our conscious emotions, generated by System 1, are later rationalized and justified through System 2 thinking. Essentially, our actions are driven by intuitive feelings rather than moral reasoning, with System 2 serving mainly to explain these gut reactions. This highlights the predominance of System 1 in guiding behavior.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 involves intuitive feelings and emotions, though they specifically mention 'conscious emotions' rather than just intuitions generally.
- Correct: The student accurately describes System 2 as involving reasoning and rationalization, explaining how it serves to justify the initial intuitive responses.
- Correct: The student clearly states that System 1 is predominant, noting that 'actions are driven by intuitive feelings rather than moral reasoning' and explicitly mentions 'the predominance of System 1 in guiding behavior.'

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

This assumption forms the basis of the representativeness heuristic. It occurs when we attribute certain traits to a person or thing based on the group we believe they belong to. For instance, our idea of a fashion model includes wearing stylish clothes. Another trait associated with this fashion model prototype is that the person actually works as a fashion model. Therefore, when I saw my colleague, I also assumed that another feature of my fashion model prototype applied to them.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process in this scenario.
- Correct: The student demonstrates a clear understanding of how the representativeness heuristic works by explaining that we estimate likelihood of category membership based on resemblance to stereotypes, using the fashion model example to illustrate the concept effectively.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring occurs when we rely on a specific piece of information as a reference during decision-making. The primacy effect refers to the tendency for the first item in a series to have a greater influence on our impression and memory than subsequent items. Both involve the initial information we encounter playing a key role in how we form judgments or remember things.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as relying on specific information as a reference during decision-making, which aligns with the answer key's definition of taking the first piece of information as a starting point.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as the first item having greater influence on impression and memory, which matches the answer key's point about better remembering the first piece of information.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both concepts involve initial information playing a key role in forming judgments, which corresponds to the answer key's point about overreliance on the first piece of information.

Score: 1.0

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to people's inclination to avoid losses, even though expected value theory suggests the value is equivalent. On the other hand, risk aversion describes people's preference for safer options, even when expected value theory indicates that riskier choices might be more advantageous over time.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves avoiding losses and mentions that people treat losses differently than equivalent gains (implicit in the expected value comparison).
- Correct: The student accurately describes risk aversion as preferring safer options over riskier ones, which captures the essence of preferring certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 1.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

It occurs when individuals believe the consequences of a decision are much more significant than they truly are. For example, during an unhappy breakup, they might exaggerate the intensity of negative emotions they expect to experience, and when comparing these feelings to their current desire to leave the relationship, they ultimately choose to stay in the unhappy partnership.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies impact bias as overestimating the significance/impact of future events, which aligns with the answer key's definition of overestimating the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly explains that impact bias prevents breakups because people exaggerate/overestimate the negative emotions they expect from breaking up, leading them to stay in unhappy relationships rather than leave.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting refers to the process by which individuals anticipate their emotional responses to significant life events. It involves the capacity to foresee future feelings. This ability is particularly crucial for decisions made at the end of life, as people often struggle to accurately estimate their desire to continue living, even in severe conditions such as near-death or a vegetative state.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines affective forecasting as predicting future emotional responses/feelings, which aligns with the answer key's definition of predictions about future emotional state.
- Correct: The student captures the key concept that people struggle to accurately predict their desire to continue living in severe conditions, which matches the answer key's point about healthy people predicting they'd prefer to die when sick but potentially feeling differently when actually sick.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

People tend to overestimate very low probabilities. This is especially true as probabilities approach zero, becoming so small that many people cannot grasp just how unlikely they really are. Consequently, extremely low probabilities are overestimated to an even greater extent.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people overestimate low probabilities, which aligns with the answer key's first point about merely low probabilities being overestimated.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that extremely low probabilities are overestimated to an even greater extent, whereas the answer key indicates that extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities (meaning they are underestimated or ignored).

Score: 0.5

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

An equal loss is experienced as more significant than an equivalent gain. Prospect theory explains that the present holds more weight than the future, which means loss aversion leads people to prioritize avoiding immediate losses, even if doing so may not be advantageous over time.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly identifies that equal losses are experienced as more significant than equivalent gains, but fails to express this in terms of utility as required. The answer incorrectly introduces temporal discounting concepts (present vs future) which are not relevant to loss aversion in prospect theory's utility framework. The key point about negative utilities being weighed more heavily or the value function being steeper for losses is missing.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected utility theory is more personalized and takes into account human behaviors such as risk aversion.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student does not mention the key distinction that expected value theory deals only with financial values while expected utility theory deals with both financial and non-financial values.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected utility theory considers risk aversion, which aligns with the answer key point about expected utility theory considering risk aversion while expected value theory does not consider heuristics and biases.

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesnâ€™t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected Value Model: This model evaluates each option based on the probability of its occurrence and the anticipated result. Expected Utility Model: This model assesses each option according to its likelihood and the personal value assigned by the individual. MTCA Model: This approach takes into account several attributes for every decision. Multiple Attribute Expected Utility Model (MAEU): Likewise, this model considers multiple attributes for each option but emphasizes the subjective weighting of each choice.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies Expected Value Model and explains it involves probability and anticipated results, which aligns with the answer key's description of financial outcomes with probabilities.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies Expected Utility Model and explains it involves likelihood and personal value, which matches the answer key's description of subjective utility rather than just financial outcomes.
- Incorrect: The student mentions 'MTCA Model' which is not the correct name (should be Multi-attribute utility theory), and the explanation is too brief and doesn't mention utilities and weights of attributes.
- Incorrect: The student describes 'Multiple Attribute Expected Utility Model (MAEU)' instead of Prospect Theory. This completely misses the fourth model which should be about descriptive/behavioral decision-making with heuristics and biases.

Score: 0.5

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease peopleâ€™s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

When individuals face substantial financial losses, they often become more willing to take risks. For example, a gambler who has nearly lost all their money after significant losses in earlier games may be driven to stake everything in an attempt to recover those losses. As a result, people become less cautious about taking risks.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion leads people to become more willing to take risks when facing potential losses, effectively making them less risk averse or even risk seeking. The gambling example appropriately illustrates how people will accept greater risks to avoid or recover from losses, which aligns with the key concept that loss aversion can decrease risk aversion.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning is a type of learning that involves linking stimuli. The two main types differ in that classical conditioning pairs a conditioned stimulus A with an unconditioned stimulus B to produce a response C. Eventually, the unconditioned stimulus B alone will trigger response C without the presence of A. In contrast, operant conditioning does not involve a third unconditioned stimulus. According to operant conditioning theory, a behavior A is more likely to be learned if it is reinforced through positive feedback.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as a type of learning involving linking/associating stimuli, which aligns with the key concept of learning associations through covariation.
- Incorrect: The student's explanation of classical conditioning is confused - they incorrectly describe the process and mix up the roles of conditioned and unconditioned stimuli. The key point about learning associations when things happen together in time and space is not captured.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that operant conditioning involves behaviors being more likely when reinforced through positive feedback, which captures the essence of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation refers to mistakenly believing that one event causes another, while illusory correlation involves wrongly assuming that two events are related or occur together.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly distinguishes between illusory causation (mistakenly believing one event causes another) and illusory correlation (wrongly assuming two events are related/occur together). This captures the essential difference between incorrectly interpreting correlation as causation versus perceiving correlation where none exists.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to â€˜properlyâ€™ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

The Dutch healthcare system follows a structured script with clear, sequential guidelines to be adhered to. In contrast, the way to act at a party is more of a schemaâ€”it's an abstract concept that cannot be strictly defined by a straightforward set of rules.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the healthcare system as a script rather than a schema. The healthcare system represents knowledge structures and relationships between concepts (how insurance works, what services are available, etc.), which is characteristic of a schema, not a sequential set of behaviors.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies birthday party behavior as a schema rather than a script. Birthday party behavior involves specific sequential actions and behavioral expectations in a social situation (arriving on time, bringing gifts, congratulating the host, etc.), which defines a script, not an abstract knowledge structure.

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

Mechanical stance involves examining the underlying processes that cause a behavior and how it arises in response to certain stimuli, much like how the interconnected gears of a clock work together to measure the passage of time.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the 'mechanical stance' rather than the 'physical stance' as the approach adopted by behaviorists. While the student correctly describes focusing on underlying processes and stimulus-response relationships, they use incorrect terminology from Dennett's framework.

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

They use the intentional stance because it explains the reasons behind the events.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the intentional stance instead of the design stance. While evolutionary psychology does explain reasons behind psychological processes, it specifically focuses on their adaptive function and design rather than beliefs and desires (which characterize the intentional stance).

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Covariation refers to A and B changing together across different situations. Temporal ordering means that A always occurs before B. Face validity is when the overall concept essentially seems reasonable. For heuristics, the effect would only occur due to the primary factor. Finally, it asks whether the outcome would still happen if A did not occur.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions 'the effect would only occur due to the primary factor' which loosely relates to distinctness/specificity, but doesn't clearly explain that B follows A but not other events.
- Incorrect: The student describes temporal ordering as 'A always occurs before B' but misses the consistency aspect that B always follows A (not just that A precedes B).
- Correct: The student's 'face validity' as 'the overall concept essentially seems reasonable' captures the essence of plausibility through common sense reasoning.
- Incorrect: The student doesn't mention contiguity in time and space - the requirement that A and B occur at the same time and location.
- Incorrect: The student doesn't address similarity in cause and effect - that A and B should superficially resemble each other.

Score: 0.2

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

When estimating how many people feel morally outraged, our minds tend to recall the most extreme examples of angry reactions. Because emotional memories are easier to store and access, availability bias influences us, leading to an overestimation of how frequently these outraged responses occur. As a result, we initially assume that most people are upset. Then, due to confirmation bias, we seek out information that supports this beliefâ€”focusing on memories of people expressing outrage on social mediaâ€”while ignoring instances when people did not react angrily, thus exaggerating the actual number of outraged individuals.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions 'availability bias' which is essentially the availability heuristic, but does not explicitly identify or define the negativity bias as a key contributing factor.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies and explains the availability heuristic (called 'availability bias'), describing how easily recalled examples lead to overestimation of frequency.
- Incorrect: While the student explains how biases work together, they focus on confirmation bias rather than the negativity bias, missing the key connection between negativity bias increasing attention to outraged content and availability heuristic causing overestimation.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

This can be attributed to a confusion or blending between two fields of knowledge, namely the biological and the physical domains.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly identifies that there is confusion/blending between domains, but incorrectly identifies the domains as biological and physical. The answer key specifies that biological concepts are incorrectly applied to the social/psychological/cultural domain, not the physical domain.

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A delusional conspiracy theory includes highly sensational elements, often involves supernatural forces, and may lead the individual to believe they are involved in the plot. Despite being easily debunked, people continue to believe in it.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student focuses on characteristics like sensational elements and supernatural forces, but misses the key distinction from the answer key: that a delusional conspiracy theory is defined by being both an irrational belief AND not commonly accepted, whereas the student's answer doesn't address the social acceptance criterion that distinguishes delusional from non-delusional conspiracy theories.

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

Your answer:

Tendency towards anxiety, elevated levels of neuroticism, low agreeableness, and a skewed understanding of fundamental areas.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions 'tendency towards anxiety' and 'elevated levels of neuroticism' which are not among the specific factors listed in the answer key (seeing patterns in randomness, believing paranormal phenomena, attributing agency, believing in simple explanations, narcissism, being male, low intelligence, low analytical thinking).
- Incorrect: The student mentions 'low agreeableness' which is not listed as one of the specific cognitive and personality factors in the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student mentions 'skewed understanding of fundamental areas' which is too vague and does not match any of the specific factors in the answer key, though it might loosely relate to low intelligence or analytical thinking but is not precise enough.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you donâ€™t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Expert intuition occurs when individuals depend on experience instead of data or feedback to assess their competence.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's answer about expert intuition is completely unrelated to the question. The question asks about psychological mechanisms by which incorrect quiz answers can interfere with learning, and the answer key expects discussion of source amnesia, proactive interference, or the continued-influence effect. The student's response does not address any of these concepts or the core issue of how incorrect answers interfere with learning.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

Repeated exposure to a statement over time leads to increased familiarity, which makes it more appealing.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that repeated exposure leads to increased familiarity, which makes statements more appealing. This directly describes the mere exposure effect, even though the student doesn't use the specific term.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Yes. Major depressive disorder affects individuals' perception of the world, leading them to make less accurate forecasts about negative occurrences.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that major depressive disorder makes people less accurate at predictions, when the correct answer is that it makes them more accurate due to reduced optimism bias. The student also incorrectly claims depression leads to less accurate forecasts, contradicting the key point about increased accuracy.

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

When sensory information becomes less reliable, prior beliefs and existing knowledge step in to shape your perception of a situation or subject.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when sensory information becomes less reliable, prior beliefs have increased influence on perception, which directly matches the key concept from the answer key.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You donâ€™t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other peopleâ€™s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

Preconventional stage involves following basic rules focused on the direct consequences of actions. Conventional stage expands to considering how actions affect others, adhering to established rules and social norms. Postconventional stage reflects a more comprehensive understanding of morality, fully appreciating ideas such as good and evil.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the preconventional level as focusing on direct consequences of actions, which aligns with avoiding punishment or gaining rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as considering how actions affect others and adhering to social norms, which matches the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student describes the postconventional level as having a comprehensive understanding of morality and appreciating abstract concepts like good and evil, which corresponds to the focus on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

The causal model of past events involves explaining outcomes by identifying reasons. This leads to hindsight bias because when we reconstruct memories with a clear understanding of why something occurred, we mistakenly believe that this logic was always present. As a result, we fail to distinguish between the past state of lacking information and the current state of awareness, causing us to think that we knew the outcome all along.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a causal model involves explaining outcomes by identifying reasons and creating logical connections between events, which aligns with the concept of a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student accurately explains how causal models contribute to hindsight bias by describing how reconstructing memories with clear reasoning makes outcomes seem inevitable and causes us to believe we 'knew it all along,' which demonstrates understanding of how causal models make events seem more inevitable than they actually were.

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

When you are acquiring new knowledge, you tend to believe you always knew it because the gradual process of consolidation prevents you from noticing the individual steps taken to reach that understanding.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes a consolidation process but misses the key mechanism of hindsight bias: the inability to ignore newly learned information when estimating past likelihood judgments. The answer focuses on believing you 'always knew' something rather than the core issue of contaminated retrospective probability assessments.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing involves making decisions with the goal of achieving the greatest possible utility. Satisficing refers to making choices that meet an individual's current needs without necessarily being the optimal option. Individuals who use maximizing strategies often tend to have higher levels of neuroticism.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as seeking the greatest possible utility/best outcome, which aligns with 'trying to make the best choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as making choices that meet current needs without being optimal, which matches 'making a good-enough choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that individuals with higher neuroticism tend to use maximizing strategies, which matches the answer key's expectation.

Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

We should focus on encouraging students to actively engage with the material. One approach is to create a strong first impression when introducing the content, as this can lead to a lasting positive perception throughout the year by taking advantage of the primacy effect. Making the material easily accessible is also important, since a complicated digital environment might discourage interaction. Offering weekly incentives, such as small points for participation, can motivate students to stay involved rather than only studying at the end. Additionally, organizing small, enjoyable projects that award pointsâ€”like pairing two randomly selected students each week to submit a PDF critiquing and supporting a particular theoryâ€”can foster interaction. These projects encourage students to exchange opposing views and eventually reach a consensus, promoting conformity through incremental collaboration (for example, two people in week 2, three in week 3, and so on). I believe this strategy will strengthen group cohesion and create a sense of unity among students, increasing their investment in their studies.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement with the question by providing multiple concrete strategies for encouraging student engagement while addressing the constraint of limited time and resources. They reference course concepts like primacy effect and conformity, propose specific solutions like weekly incentives and collaborative projects, and show understanding of practical considerations such as accessibility and scalable assessment methods.
