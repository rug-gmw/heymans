## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

System 2 should primarily guide moral reasoning, although people tend to depend more on System 1. System 1 involves fast, emotional, and biased thinking, whereas System 2 is focused on deliberate, logical, and effortful thought.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies System 1 as involving emotional thinking, which aligns with the answer key's requirement to identify System 1 as intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies System 2 as deliberate, logical thought, which matches the answer key's requirement to identify System 2 as reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student states that 'people tend to depend more on System 1,' which correctly identifies System 1 as more dominant than System 2, satisfying the answer key requirement.

Score: 1.0

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

The representativeness heuristic occurs when you assume someone belongs to a certain category based on traits you associate with that group, leading to biased judgments.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process in this scenario.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that the representativeness heuristic involves assuming category membership based on associated traits/characteristics, which captures the essence of judging likelihood based on resemblance to stereotypes.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring refers to the initial impression you form, which acts like a fixed point, making it difficult to alter once established. The primacy effect means that the first number you encounter impacts your judgments about subsequent numbers, with that initial number serving as a kind of anchor. This is the similarity they share.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as involving an initial impression that acts as a fixed point and is difficult to alter, which captures the essence of taking the first piece of information as a starting point.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly describes the primacy effect as the first number impacting judgments about subsequent numbers, confusing it with anchoring. The primacy effect is actually about better remembering the first piece of information, not about judgment influence.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both concepts share a reliance on the first piece of information encountered, though they describe it as the first number serving as an anchor rather than more generally as overreliance on first information.

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the desire to prevent losses no matter what, whereas risk aversion involves a strong preference for avoiding any risk altogether.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes loss aversion as 'desire to prevent losses no matter what' which misses the key concept that losses are weighted more heavily than equivalent gains. The answer doesn't capture the comparative aspect of loss aversion.
- Incorrect: The student defines risk aversion as 'avoiding any risk altogether' which is too extreme. Risk aversion refers to preferring certainty over uncertainty, not complete avoidance of all risk.

Score: 0.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias is the error of overestimating how much an event will affect you emotionally in the future, which can lead people to avoid ending relationships because they anticipate experiencing more negative emotions than they actually will.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as overestimating how much an event will affect you emotionally in the future, which matches the answer key's definition of overestimating the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly explains that impact bias prevents breakups because people anticipate experiencing more negative emotions than they actually will, which aligns with the answer key's point about overestimating how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves predicting your future emotions, but these predictions are frequently inaccurate. This is particularly relevant for end-of-life choices, as emotions can shift more quickly—and often more positively—than we expect.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies affective forecasting as predicting future emotions, which matches the answer key's definition of 'predictions about our own future emotional state.'
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of the key concept that healthy people's predictions about their preferences when sick may be inaccurate, noting that emotions can shift more positively than expected, which aligns with the answer key's point about preference changes.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

Yes, individuals tend to overvalue the likelihood of low-probability events but undervalue the shifts in extremely low-probability events, perceiving them as unavoidable.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that low-probability events are overvalued/overestimated, which aligns with the answer key's point about merely low probabilities being overestimated.
- Incorrect: The student states that extremely low probabilities are perceived as 'unavoidable,' which contradicts the answer key. The correct concept is that extremely low probabilities are treated as impossibilities (ignored), not as unavoidable certainties.

Score: 0.5

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion represents a tendency to experience losses as more painful than equivalent gains are pleasurable.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion means losses have greater psychological impact than equivalent gains, which captures the core concept that negative utilities are weighted more heavily than positive utilities in prospect theory.

Score: 1.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

One distinction is that expected value theory focuses on fixed values, whereas expected utility involves utilities that can vary based on individual preferences. Additionally, expected value theory considers only monetary values, while expected utility incorporates non-monetary factors as well.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory deals with monetary/financial values while expected utility theory incorporates non-monetary factors, which matches the first point in the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student mentions that expected utility involves utilities that vary based on individual preferences, but does not specifically address the key difference regarding heuristics/biases versus risk aversion as stated in the answer key.

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected value theory focuses on decision-making involving financial amounts by summing both positive and negative values. Expected utility theory, on the other hand, considers utilities rather than just monetary values. Multiple attribute utility theory (MAUT) addresses decisions involving several attributes or more complex utilities, resulting in multiple potential outcomes. Prospect theory is similar to expected utility theory but incorporates heuristics and biases into the decision-making process.

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies expected value theory as focusing on financial outcomes and mentions summing values, which captures the essence of calculating expected values with probabilities.
- Correct: Student correctly explains that expected utility theory considers utilities rather than just monetary values, which is the key distinction from expected value theory.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies MAUT as dealing with multiple attributes and complex utilities, capturing the core concept of multi-attribute decision making.
- Correct: Student correctly describes prospect theory as similar to expected utility theory but incorporating heuristics and biases, which accurately captures its descriptive/behavioral nature.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

The greater your aversion to loss, the more cautious you are with risk, and vice versa.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that loss aversion increases risk aversion, when the answer key indicates that loss aversion actually decreases risk aversion and can make people risk-seeking when trying to avoid potential losses.

Score: 0.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves forming new associations between two elements. In classical conditioning, this means connecting stimuli so that a conditioned stimulus triggers a conditioned response, linking it with an unconditioned stimulus. In operant conditioning, it involves associating a behavior with the consequences that follow, such as a reward or punishment.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that conditioning involves forming associations between elements, which aligns with the key concept of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of classical conditioning by explaining how stimuli become connected, with conditioned stimuli triggering responses through association with unconditioned stimuli, which captures the essence of learning associations when things happen together.
- Correct: The student accurately describes operant conditioning as associating behaviors with their consequences (rewards or punishments), which matches the answer key's description of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation occurs when someone wrongly assumes a cause-and-effect relationship exists, even though only a correlation is present. Illusory correlation happens when a person incorrectly perceives a connection or relationship between two unrelated things.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that illusory causation involves wrongly assuming causation from correlation, and that illusory correlation involves perceiving a connection between unrelated variables. This matches the key distinction that illusory causation misinterprets existing correlation as causation, while illusory correlation perceives correlation where none actually exists.

Score: 1.0

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

The Dutch healthcare system functions as a schema because it offers insight into how the system operates, while knowing how to act at a birthday party is a script, or social script, as it guides behavior in a social setting that can be quite predictable when followed properly.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the Dutch healthcare system as a schema and provides an appropriate explanation that it offers insight into how the system operates, which aligns with the answer key's emphasis on knowledge and relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies birthday party behavior as a script/social script and accurately explains that it guides behavior in a social setting, which matches the answer key's description of a social schema for specific situational behavior.

Score: 1.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

The physical stance focuses solely on the physical aspect of behavior, without attributing any function, purpose, or motivation to it. For example, a stimulus might be linked to an increase in adrenaline, and so on.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that behaviorists adopted the physical stance and provides accurate reasoning - they focused on physical processes (like stimulus-response connections and physiological mechanisms such as adrenaline) without considering mental states, purposes, or motivations, which aligns with the behaviorist emphasis on observable, measurable physical processes.

Score: 1.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

The functional perspective focuses on the role or purpose of the behavior rather than its physical form or the reasons behind it.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly identifies that evolutionary psychology focuses on function/purpose, but fails to explicitly identify this as the 'design stance' from Dennett's framework, which was specifically asked for in the question.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

You conclude that A causes B when: 1) A and B occur near each other in time and place, 2) B consistently happens only after A, 3) it makes logical and intuitive sense that A leads to B, 4) A and B share some similar characteristics, and 5) no other influencing factors affecting A and B are evident.

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies contiguity in time and space, mentioning that A and B occur near each other in time and place.
- Correct: Student captures consistency by stating B consistently happens only after A, which aligns with the concept that B always follows A.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies plausibility by mentioning it makes logical and intuitive sense that A leads to B, which matches the common sense criterion.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies similarity in cause and effect by stating A and B share similar characteristics, which aligns with superficial resemblance.
- Incorrect: Student mentions 'no other influencing factors' which relates to controlling confounds but does not capture distinctness/specificity - that B follows A but not other events.

Score: 0.8

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

The availability heuristic and negativity bias work together in this case because they both involve the ease with which certain information comes to mind. The availability heuristic causes you to believe things you encounter frequently, while negativity bias makes negative information more memorable. Combined, these biases make the small group producing negative content seem more prominent than they actually are.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias and explains that it makes negative information more memorable, which aligns with the answer key's description of placing more weight on negative/morally outraged content.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the availability heuristic and explains it as believing things you encounter frequently, which matches the answer key's definition of estimating frequency based on ease of recall.
- Correct: The student successfully explains how these biases work together - negativity bias makes negative content more memorable, which increases available examples for the availability heuristic, leading to overestimation of moral outrage frequency.

Score: 1.0

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

This can be understood through various framework theories applied to different areas of knowledge, such as the idea that you link negative feelings to both the object and the person you dislike. Although you may recognize that these feelings are irrational, it is difficult to avoid them because emotions and reasoning operate independently within the brain.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student discusses emotional associations and dual-process thinking but fails to identify the key concept of domain transfer - specifically that biological contagion concepts are being incorrectly applied to social/psychological situations. The answer does not mention framework theories or cross-domain application.

Score: 0.0

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A delusional conspiracy is generally not accepted and is considered highly improbable based on logical reasoning, whereas a non-delusional conspiracy is more widely accepted and can be supported with stronger reasoning.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that delusional conspiracy theories are not commonly accepted and distinguishes them from non-delusional ones based on rational support/reasoning, which aligns with the key distinction of irrational belief versus rational belief.

Score: 1.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

1: Quickly linking unrelated things 2: Ignoring evidence by bypassing logical, deliberate thinking 3: Possessing a personality trait that leads to overconfidence, believing you are always right and dismissing others' viewpoints

Feedback:

- Correct: The student's description of 'quickly linking unrelated things' aligns with the answer key point about 'seeing patterns in randomness' - both describe the tendency to make connections where none exist.
- Correct: The student's description of 'ignoring evidence by bypassing logical, deliberate thinking' corresponds to the answer key point about 'having a low level of analytical thinking' - both describe insufficient critical evaluation of information.
- Correct: The student's description of 'possessing a personality trait that leads to overconfidence, believing you are always right and dismissing others' viewpoints' accurately captures the answer key point about 'being narcissistic' - both describe inflated self-regard and dismissal of others.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

By means of the psychological process that leads you to incorporate information into your beliefs, even when you were previously aware that the information was false. This is the same mechanism explained in response to question 21.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes a general mechanism of incorporating false information into beliefs but does not specifically identify any of the key psychological mechanisms from the answer key (source amnesia, proactive interference, or continued-influence effect). The reference to 'question 21' suggests they may be thinking of the continued-influence effect, but without explicitly naming it or providing the specific mechanism, the answer lacks the required precision.

Score: 0.0

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

Through the psychological process that incorporates information into our beliefs, even when we initially recognize that the information was false, we engage the same mechanism mentioned in question 7. I hope Professor Sebastiaan considers both answers correct.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's answer describes a vague psychological process about incorporating false information into beliefs, but does not identify the specific mechanism of mere exposure or the illusory-truth effect. The reference to 'question 7' is unclear and the answer lacks the key concept that repeated exposure increases preference or perceived truthfulness.

Score: 0.0

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Yes, because they are depressed, negative thoughts come to mind more easily due to the availability heuristic.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that depression makes people less accurate at predictions due to negative thoughts being more available. The correct answer is that depression actually makes people more accurate because it reduces optimistic bias, not because it increases negative thinking through availability heuristic.

Score: 0.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

Then the impact of previous beliefs grows.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that prior beliefs have increased influence when sensory information is less reliable, which matches the key concept that perception becomes more dependent on expectations when sensory evidence is unreliable.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

1: At the pre-conventional level, decisions are driven by self-interest, with learning occurring through rewards or punishments. 2: At the conventional level, behavior is guided by understanding and adhering to what others approve of, following established rules deemed fair. 3: At the post-conventional level, individuals base their actions on personal principles and their own sense of morality.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the pre-conventional level as being driven by self-interest and involving rewards/punishments, which aligns with the answer key's description of obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as being guided by what others approve of and following established rules, which matches the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the post-conventional level as being based on personal principles and one's own sense of morality, which corresponds to the answer key's description of focus on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model of past events is a mental shortcut where you attempt to determine cause-and-effect relationships between previous events. When done after an event has occurred, this can lead to outcome bias, as identifying causality afterward may create the illusion that you predicted the outcome all along.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies a causal model as involving cause-and-effect relationships between past events, which aligns with the concept of a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student explains how causal models contribute to hindsight bias by creating 'the illusion that you predicted the outcome all along,' which captures the essence of how events seem more inevitable than they were, contributing to hindsight bias.

Score: 1.0

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Learning leads to hindsight bias because when you acquire new information, you naturally incorporate it, making it difficult to recall how you reasoned before knowing it, causing you to believe you always knew the outcome.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly explains that learning contributes to hindsight bias by making it difficult to avoid incorporating newly acquired information when trying to recall past judgments, which aligns with the key concept that you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account when estimating past likelihood judgments.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing involves striving to select the optimal choice every time, whereas satisficing means opting for a decision that is good enough rather than the absolute best. Individuals with higher levels of neuroticism tend to be more inclined to maximize.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as striving to select the optimal choice, which aligns with 'trying to make the best choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as opting for a decision that is good enough rather than the absolute best, which matches 'making a good-enough choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that individuals with higher levels of neuroticism tend to be more inclined to maximize, which corresponds to the answer key's point about high neuroticism leading to maximizing decision style.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

You did a great job by assigning where to apply the course material, sending emails in advance to encourage reflection, allowing us to submit questions, and connecting the content to current and relevant examples like Donald Trump. Using AI certainly enables more grading to be done. I appreciated the Heymans app for learning this way, as active recall and self-testing are effective for improving memory and engagement. I recommend making these applications more user-friendly—for instance, avoiding the need to restart the program after each answer and allowing multiple questions to be answered at once without having to request them every time. When I asked the AI for numerous questions covering all chapter terminology, it occasionally struggled due to word limits. I also like when heuristics are applied to real-life situations since textbook and AI examples can feel somewhat dull. It might be better to move through the terminology quicker and dedicate the final lecture to practical scenarios and applications. Alternatively, replacing a lecture with a tutorial could help, as discussions in tutorials are generally easier for students. I find it challenging to switch between absorbing new information, thinking critically, and responding during lectures, which affects my engagement.

Feedback:
