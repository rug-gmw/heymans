## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidtâ€™s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

System 1 thinking is fast, emotional, influenced by feelings, and requires little effort. In contrast, System 2 thinking is slow, rule-based, logical, and demands more mental effort. According to the dual process model, people use both systems, but primarily rely on System 1. However, when they need to make a more rational choice, they engage System 2, which involves greater cognitive effort. In moral reasoning, System 1 often generates an immediate emotional response encouraging a certain action, while System 2 may intervene to evaluate whether that action is morally acceptable.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies System 1 as emotional and feeling-based, which aligns with the answer key's requirement to identify System 1 as involving intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student correctly describes System 2 as logical and rule-based, which corresponds to the answer key's requirement to identify System 2 as involving reasoning/rational thought.
- Correct: The student states that people 'primarily rely on System 1' and describes it as generating immediate responses while System 2 'may intervene,' clearly indicating System 1's dominance over System 2.

Score: 1.0

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

The representativeness heuristic suggests that the likelihood of an individual being part of a group increases when they closely match the typical characteristics of that group. In other words, if person Y looks similar to the standard image of group X, it is assumed that Y belongs to group X.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying mechanism for this assumption.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that the representativeness heuristic involves estimating likelihood of category membership based on resemblance to typical characteristics or stereotypes of that category, using clear language about matching standard images of groups.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring is a phenomenon where the initial information given serves as a reference point for shaping an overall impression. Subsequent information is used to modify this reference, but the final judgment typically remains close to the original anchor. The primacy effect refers to the tendency for the first piece of information to have a greater impact and strongly influence the overall assessment. Both concepts share the idea that the initial information presented plays the most significant role in forming an impression.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as using initial information as a reference point and explains how subsequent information modifies but stays close to this anchor, which aligns with the concept of taking first information as a starting point.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as the first piece of information having greater impact and strongly influencing overall assessment, which corresponds to better remembering first information.
- Correct: The student clearly states that both concepts share the idea that initial information plays the most significant role in forming impressions, which captures the overreliance on first information.

Score: 1.0

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the idea that experiencing losses affects you more strongly, emotionally, than gaining an equivalent amount. Risk aversion describes the tendency of individuals to prefer avoiding risky situations rather than taking chances.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves losses affecting people more strongly than equivalent gains, which matches the answer key's concept of weighing losses more heavily than gains.
- Correct: The student accurately describes risk aversion as preferring to avoid risky situations rather than taking chances, which aligns with the answer key's definition of preferring certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 1.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias refers to the tendency of individuals to overestimate the emotional effect a negative event will have on them. In the case of a breakup, people often believe it will cause significant emotional distress, but in reality, the impact is usually less severe than they anticipate.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as overestimating the emotional effect/impact of future events, though they specifically mention negative events rather than future events in general.
- Correct: The student correctly explains that impact bias prevents breakups because people overestimate how bad the emotional distress from breaking up will be, which aligns with the answer key's point about overestimating how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves predicting your future emotional state. Many people struggle to accurately envision how they will feel later on. This difficulty applies to end-of-life choices as well; since it's hard to anticipate your future emotions, deciding now may not truly reflect your genuine desires. Frequently, current thoughts about the future don't align with the feelings you will actually experience.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines affective forecasting as predicting future emotional states, which matches the answer key definition.
- Correct: The student explains that people struggle to accurately predict future emotions and that current end-of-life preferences may not align with actual future feelings, which captures the key concept that healthy people's predictions about preferring death when sick may not match their actual preferences when they become ill.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

Prospect theory suggests that individuals tend to downplay very small probabilities, often treating extremely low chances (like 0.01%) as if they were zero, even though these probabilities are not actually zero but simply very low. Additionally, people view moderately low probabilities (such as 10%) as likely to occur, yet they still tend to underestimate their true likelihood.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student states that people 'underestimate' moderately low probabilities like 10%, but the answer key indicates they are 'overestimated'.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that extremely low probabilities are treated 'as if they were zero' which aligns with the answer key's point about being 'interpreted as impossibilities'.

Score: 0.5

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion is a concept that negatively affects utility. People tend to avoid taking risks, and if they do take risks, it leads to a decrease in utility. When a decision involves the potential for loss, the perceived utility of that option is reduced.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes loss aversion as a general concept about risk avoidance and utility reduction, but fails to capture the key insight that loss aversion specifically means negative utilities (losses) are weighted more heavily than positive utilities (gains) of the same magnitude, or that the value function is steeper for losses than gains.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory is used solely for selecting the optimal financial result. In contrast, expected utility theory applies not only to financial decisions but also to various other contexts. Additionally, expected utility theory incorporates heuristics and biases like loss aversion and considers the emotional impact of a particular outcome.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory deals only with financial values while expected utility theory applies to broader contexts beyond just financial decisions.
- Incorrect: The student mentions that expected utility theory incorporates heuristics and biases, but this is incorrect. Expected utility theory is a normative model that assumes rational decision-making and does not incorporate biases. The answer key specifically states that expected value theory does not consider heuristics/biases while expected utility theory considers risk aversion (not biases).

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesnâ€™t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected value theory states that we choose the option with the highest financial return. Expected utility suggests we select the choice that offers the best outcome considering emotions and aversion to loss. Prospect theory builds on expected utility by incorporating mental shortcuts into the decision-making process. Dual process models propose that decisions are made using both system 1, which is driven by emotions, and system 2, which is more logical and rule-based.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as focusing on financial outcomes and choosing the option with highest return, which aligns with the normative model involving financial outcomes and probabilities.
- Correct: The student accurately describes expected utility theory as considering subjective outcomes beyond financial (emotions, loss aversion), which matches the answer key's description of utility that can be subjective rather than just financial.
- Incorrect: The student mentions prospect theory but fails to identify multi-attribute utility theory, which is a distinct model involving multiple attributes with utilities and weights. Instead, they discuss dual process models which is not one of the four required models.
- Correct: The student correctly describes prospect theory as building on expected utility while incorporating mental shortcuts (heuristics), which aligns with the answer key's description of it being a descriptive model that considers heuristics and biases.

Score: 0.75

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease peopleâ€™s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency for individuals to perceive losses as more painful and impactful than equivalent gains. When someone experiences strong loss aversion, they see losses as more damaging than gains are rewarding, leading them to avoid risky situations that might result in a loss. As a result, higher loss aversion is often linked to greater risk aversion, as people try to steer clear of scenarios where they could lose something.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly defines loss aversion but misses the key insight from the answer key. They argue that loss aversion increases risk aversion, when the correct answer is that loss aversion can actually decrease risk aversion and make people risk-seeking when they are trying to avoid losses (i.e., people will take risks to prevent losses).

Score: 0.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning is a method of learning by forming connections. Classical conditioning involves learning associations between two events that occur simultaneously. Operant conditioning involves learning through consequences, such as rewards or punishments.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as a learning method involving forming connections/associations, which aligns with the key concept of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as learning associations between two events that occur simultaneously, which matches the answer key's description of learning to associate things that happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning through consequences like rewards or punishments, which directly corresponds to the answer key's definition of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation involves perceiving cause-and-effect connections that don't actually exist. Illusory correlation refers to noticing relationships between two things that aren't genuinely related. The key distinction is that causation implies one event causes another, whereas correlation means two events occur together and are assumed to be connected, even though in reality they are not.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly defines illusory causation as perceiving non-existent cause-and-effect connections, when it actually refers to misinterpreting real correlations as causal relationships. The distinction provided confuses causation vs correlation generally rather than addressing the specific difference between these two illusions.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to â€˜properlyâ€™ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

A schema is a mental framework for understanding how to act in a particular context (such as understanding the functioning of the healthcare system), while a script is a more detailed version of a schema, applied to frequent and culturally specific situations (like a birthday party, which is a common and culturally defined event).

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly defines schema as a framework for understanding how to act in a particular context and identifies the healthcare system as a schema for this reason. However, the healthcare system is a schema because it represents knowledge and relationships between concepts, not behavioral guidelines.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the birthday party as a script and provides an appropriate justification, recognizing it as a culturally specific situation with behavioral expectations, which aligns with the concept of scripts as social schemas for specific situations.

Score: 0.5

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

They took the intentional stance, which emphasizes understanding the purpose behind people's actions in this case, aligning with the approach behaviorists use. (From the intentional stance, it considers how stimuli elicit behavior based on the intentions driving people's actions.)

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the intentional stance. Behaviorists actually adopted the physical stance because they focused on observable stimulus-response mechanisms and rejected mentalistic explanations. The intentional stance involves attributing beliefs and desires to explain behavior, which is opposite to the behaviorist approach that avoided discussing internal mental states or intentions.

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

Evolutionary psychologists tend to take the mechanical stance, which is the most appropriate perspective for understanding their approach. This stance involves seeking explanations based on how something works or functions. Evolutionary psychologists focus on understanding why traits or behaviors exist by examining their development and changes over time through evolution, aligning with the mechanical stance.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the mechanical stance instead of the design stance. While they correctly note that evolutionary psychologists focus on function and why traits exist, the mechanical stance concerns how something works mechanistically, whereas the design stance concerns what something is designed to do or its purpose/function, which is what evolutionary psychology actually adopts.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Causal heuristics: We often perceive cause-and-effect relationships in situations where there may not actually be any causal connection. Consistency: the uniqueness or distinctiveness of an event; consistency over time and across different contexts.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions 'uniqueness or distinctiveness' but confuses it with consistency. They don't properly explain distinctness/specificity as B following A but not other events.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies consistency and mentions it involves consistency 'over time and across different contexts,' which captures the essence that B always follows A.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention plausibility as a heuristic or explain that common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention contiguity in time and space as a heuristic or explain that A and B occur at the same time and location.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention similarity in cause and effect as a heuristic or explain that A and B superficially resemble each other.

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Ingroup/outgroup bias leads us to view people outside our group more negatively than those within it, often attributing their bad behavior to their character rather than external circumstances. Confirmation bias causes us to look for information that supports our existing beliefs. Together, these biases reinforce each other: confirmation bias makes us focus on evidence that confirms our negative views of outgroup members and the idea that their actions stem from internal traits, which strengthens our original belief.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student identifies ingroup/outgroup bias instead of negativity bias. While ingroup/outgroup bias can contribute to moral judgments, it doesn't specifically explain the tendency to seek out or place more weight on negative/outraged content that drives overestimation on social media.
- Incorrect: The student identifies confirmation bias instead of availability heuristic. Confirmation bias involves seeking information that confirms existing beliefs, but availability heuristic specifically explains how easily recalled examples (like frequent exposure to outraged content) lead to overestimating frequency.
- Incorrect: While the student correctly explains how their two identified biases work together, they don't explain the specific mechanism from the answer key: how negativity bias increases exposure to outraged content, which through availability heuristic leads to overestimating moral outrage frequency.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

Magical contagion refers to the idea that a person applies their understanding or beliefs from one area of knowledge to a different area where those ideas may no longer be relevant. For example, if something was owned by someone disliked, one might incorrectly assume the person's traits or assumptions influence the things that once belonged to them.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that magical contagion involves applying concepts from one domain (biological contagion) to another inappropriate domain (social/psychological), and provides a relevant example showing understanding of cross-domain misapplication.

Score: 1.0

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A delusional conspiracy is usually not feasible according to scientific understanding. In contrast, a non-delusional conspiracy may be scientifically plausible, but it lacks conclusive scientific evidence at this time.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student focuses on scientific feasibility and plausibility rather than the key criteria from the answer key: irrationality of belief and common acceptance. The answer key defines delusional conspiracy theories as those that are both irrational beliefs AND not commonly accepted, which is different from the student's emphasis on scientific understanding and evidence.

Score: 0.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

They tend to dismiss scientific information more readily, making them more susceptible to accepting misleading information as fact. They frequently perceive cause-and-effect connections where none actually exist.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The answer mentions dismissing scientific information and accepting misleading information, but this doesn't directly match any of the specific factors listed in the answer key such as seeing patterns in randomness, believing paranormal phenomena, or the other specified cognitive/personality factors.
- Correct: The phrase 'perceive cause-and-effect connections where none actually exist' aligns well with 'attributing agency where it does not exist' from the answer key, as both describe incorrectly inferring causal relationships or intentional forces.
- Incorrect: The student only provided two factors when the question explicitly asks for three factors, and only one of the two factors clearly matches the answer key criteria.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you donâ€™t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

This occurs through the process of anchoring and adjustment: your initial response serves as the anchor, and upon realizing it is incorrect, you revise your belief based on the accurate information.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes anchoring and adjustment, which is about starting from an initial value and adjusting from there. However, the question asks how incorrect answers can interfere with learning, and the answer key focuses on source amnesia (forgetting the source of information) or proactive interference (old information interfering with new learning). Anchoring and adjustment doesn't explain how incorrect answers interfere with learning - it actually describes a process of correction rather than interference.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

Due to the mere exposure effect, repeated exposure to something leads to developing a more favorable attitude toward it.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the mere exposure effect as the psychological mechanism, accurately explaining that repeated exposure leads to more favorable attitudes, which directly matches the answer key's explanation of the tendency to prefer familiar things.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Yes, when you're depressed, you have greater access to negative information (availability heuristic). As a result, when you anticipate negative outcomes, the abundance of negative examples that come to mind easily makes you believe these outcomes are more probable.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that depression makes people less accurate by overestimating negative outcomes due to availability heuristic. The correct answer is that depression actually makes people MORE accurate because it reduces unrealistic optimism, leading to more realistic (not overly pessimistic) predictions.

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

As sensory information becomes less reliable, individuals tend to rely more heavily on their initial beliefs and make decisions primarily influenced by those prior assumptions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when sensory information becomes less reliable, people rely more heavily on their prior beliefs/initial assumptions, which directly matches the answer key's requirement that prior beliefs have increased influence on perception when sensory reliability decreases.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You donâ€™t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other peopleâ€™s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

Preconventional: at this stage, you form your sense of right and wrong based on the consequences of actions, such as punishments and rewards. Conventional: here, you shape your moral judgments by recognizing what is socially acceptable and what the law permits. Postconventional: after the conventional stage, you develop your moral reasoning independently, based on your own principles.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the preconventional level as focusing on consequences like punishments and rewards, which matches the answer key's description of obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as being based on social acceptability and law, which aligns with the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the postconventional level as involving independent moral reasoning based on one's own principles, which matches the answer key's description of focus on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model of past events suggests that people seek to understand the world by making causal assumptions once an event has taken place. As a result, after an event occurs, they believe that the observed outcome was the most probable one (hindsight bias), since they link the event to that particular result. They often overlook or downplay the likelihood of other potential outcomes.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a causal model involves making causal assumptions to understand how past events are related, which aligns with the answer key's definition of a coherent narrative of related past events.
- Correct: The student accurately explains how causal models contribute to hindsight bias by making people believe the observed outcome was most probable and linking events to particular results, which captures the essence that events seem more inevitable than they were.

Score: 1.0

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

When a particular result occurs, you come to associate that situation with that specific outcome. Hindsight bias refers to the tendency of people to believe, after the fact, that they predicted the outcome all along, even though they did not to that degree. When you acquire new information, it becomes more accessible in your mind (availability heuristic) following the outcome, which enhances the feeling that you had foreseen it from the start (hindsight bias).

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly explains that newly learned information becomes more accessible and influences retrospective judgments, making people feel they predicted outcomes they didn't actually foresee. This captures the core concept that new information cannot be avoided when estimating past likelihood judgments, which is the essence of the answer key point.

Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing involves striving to make the optimal decision, while satisficing means settling for a choice that is satisfactory or adequate. Individuals with high levels of neuroticism often prefer the maximizing approach, as they tend to be less content with their current situation and continuously seek the best possible outcome.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as striving to make the optimal decision, which aligns with the answer key's definition of trying to make the best choice.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as settling for a choice that is satisfactory or adequate, which matches the answer key's definition of making a good-enough choice.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that individuals high in neuroticism prefer the maximizing approach and provides appropriate reasoning about their tendency to seek the best possible outcome.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

You could apply operant conditioning by encouraging students to volunteer as assistants, allowing them to help create personalized exams that need individual feedback and grading. This approach would save time, and you can reinforce their willingness to volunteer by offering rewards, such as extra credit on their exams.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement with the question by proposing a specific solution that addresses the core challenge of limited time and resources while promoting active engagement. They apply course concepts (operant conditioning, reinforcement) to create a practical approach where students become teaching assistants, and they consider the motivational aspect through rewards like extra credit. The answer shows thoughtful consideration of how to balance resource constraints with student engagement goals.
