## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

System 1 describes the quick, instinctive, and emotion-based mode of thinking that can result in biased moral decisions, whereas System 2 involves deliberate, logical, and effortful reasoning. According to the social-intuitionist model, System 1 is dominant because intuitions are primarily emotional reactions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies System 1 as emotion-based and instinctive thinking, which aligns with the answer key's description of System 1 as intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student accurately describes System 2 as deliberate, logical, and effortful reasoning, which matches the answer key's description of System 2 as reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student clearly states that System 1 is dominant and explains this is because intuitions are primarily emotional reactions, which correctly identifies System 1 (intuition/emotion) as more dominant than System 2.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

Representativeness heuristic refers to the tendency to classify something into a category based on how closely it matches the typical characteristics of that category.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process in this scenario.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that the representativeness heuristic involves classifying based on how closely something matches typical characteristics of a category, which aligns with the answer key's explanation about estimating likelihood based on resemblance to stereotypes.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring involves using an initial piece of information as a reference point and then modifying our beliefs from there. The primacy effect indicates that the information encountered first has a significant impact on our evaluation. Both concepts act as initial benchmarks that guide our judgments and decisions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as using initial information as a reference point, which aligns with the answer key's description of taking the first piece of information as the starting point.
- Incorrect: The student describes the primacy effect as information having 'significant impact on evaluation' rather than specifically addressing the memory aspect - that it's the tendency to better remember first information.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both concepts involve using initial information as benchmarks that guide judgments, which captures the essence of overreliance on first information.

Score: 0.6666666666666666

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion describes how individuals view losses as more significant or impactful compared to gains of an equal amount. Risk aversion describes the preference for a guaranteed result over a risky alternative and is a concept utilized in both expected utility theory and prospect theory.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves viewing losses as more significant than equivalent gains, which matches the answer key's definition.
- Correct: The student accurately describes risk aversion as preferring guaranteed results over risky alternatives, which aligns with the answer key's definition of preferring certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 1.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias is the mistaken belief about the extent to which a future event will affect us emotionally. Individuals often exaggerate both the strength and length of negative emotions, such as imagining they will remain sad and lonely for an extended period after a breakup.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as overestimating how future events will affect us emotionally, which matches the answer key's definition of overestimating the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Correct: The student explains that people exaggerate the strength and length of negative emotions after a breakup, which directly addresses how impact bias prevents breakups by making people overestimate how bad they will feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting is the process of predicting how a future event will influence our emotions. It matters in end-of-life choices because individuals might make biased decisions based on their expectations of the emotional effects of a particular care or treatment.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies affective forecasting as predicting future emotional states, which aligns with the answer key's definition of 'predictions about our own future emotional state.'
- Correct: The student understands the relevance to end-of-life decisions by noting that people might make biased decisions based on emotional expectations, which captures the essence of healthy people potentially changing their preferences when actually sick.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

People tend to overvalue the likelihood of events that have a very small chance of happening. While it varies, individuals often exaggerate how probable such rare events are.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people overestimate low probabilities, which aligns with the answer key point about merely low probabilities being overestimated.
- Incorrect: The student does not distinguish between merely low probabilities and extremely low probabilities, missing the key point that extremely low probabilities are often treated as impossibilities rather than overestimated.

Score: 0.5

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

It illustrates how individuals tend to view losses as more significant than gains of equal amount. As a result, prospect theory suggests that people prefer to avoid risks when there is a possibility of losing.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion means losses are viewed as more significant than equivalent gains, which directly corresponds to the answer key's point that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory applies primarily to financial results, whereas expected utility theory is used for non-financial situations and incorporates considerations of risk aversion.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory deals with financial results while expected utility theory handles non-financial situations, which aligns with the answer key's distinction between financial and non-financial values.
- Correct: The student correctly mentions that expected utility theory incorporates risk aversion, which matches the answer key's point about expected utility theory considering risk aversion while expected value theory does not consider heuristics and biases.

Score: 1.0

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected utility theory, expected value theory, multi-attribute utility theory, and prospect theory are key decision-making models. Expected utility theory, a normative approach, focuses on decisions made based on the subjective value of outcomes, typically for non-financial situations. Expected value theory, also normative, involves making decisions grounded in the objective values of outcomes, commonly applied to financial contexts. Multi-attribute utility theory, another normative model, deals with decisions involving several factors, each weighted differently. Prospect theory, in contrast, is a descriptive model that explains decision-making by evaluating gains and losses while accounting for biases and heuristics.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as a normative model and mentions it involves objective values of outcomes in financial contexts, which aligns with the answer key's description of financial outcomes with probabilities.
- Correct: The student accurately describes expected utility theory as a normative approach focusing on subjective value of outcomes for non-financial situations, which matches the answer key's explanation of utility that doesn't need to be financial but can be subjective.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies multi-attribute utility theory as a normative model dealing with decisions involving several factors that are weighted differently, which corresponds to the answer key's description of multiple attributes with utilities and weights.
- Correct: The student properly characterizes prospect theory as a descriptive model that accounts for biases and heuristics while evaluating gains and losses, which aligns with the answer key's description of it being a behavioral model similar to expected utility theory but considering heuristics and biases.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Individuals consistently seek to prevent losses, so by steering clear of risks, they minimize possible losses and enhance the value of their results.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that people steer clear of risks to minimize losses, which contradicts the key concept that loss aversion actually makes people MORE willing to take risks when facing potential losses (risk-seeking in the loss domain).

Score: 0.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves learning connections based on co-occurrence. Classical conditioning is the process of learning associations due to events happening close together in time and location. Operant conditioning involves learning associations based on the relationship between behaviors and their subsequent rewards or punishments.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as learning connections/associations based on co-occurrence, which aligns with the answer key's definition of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as learning associations when events happen close together in time and location, which matches the answer key's description of associating things that happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning associations between behaviors and their subsequent rewards or punishments, which aligns with the answer key's definition of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation involves mistakenly believing that one event causes another when there is merely a correlation, whereas illusory correlation involves wrongly perceiving a relationship or association between two events when no such connection exists.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly distinguishes between illusory causation (mistaking correlation for causation) and illusory correlation (perceiving correlation where none exists). The explanation accurately captures that illusory causation involves misinterpreting an existing correlation as causal, while illusory correlation involves perceiving a non-existent relationship.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

Grasping the Dutch healthcare system is a script since it is tied to a particular culture. In contrast, knowing the appropriate behavior at a birthday party is a schema, as schemas involve our learned expectations for certain situations or events.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the healthcare system as a script. The healthcare system represents organized knowledge and relationships between concepts (hospitals, insurance, procedures), making it a schema, not a script.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies birthday party behavior as a schema. While they correctly note it involves learned expectations, birthday party behavior is a script because it specifies sequential actions and behaviors for a specific social situation.

Score: 0.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

They embraced the intentional stance, aiming to understand the reasons and intentions driving a particular behavior.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies behaviorists as adopting the intentional stance. Behaviorists explicitly rejected mental states, intentions, and reasons as explanatory concepts, instead focusing on observable stimulus-response relationships. This represents the physical stance, not the intentional stance which deals with beliefs, desires, and intentions that behaviorists considered unmeasurable and unscientific.

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

They use the design stance to clarify the function or role of a specific mechanism, such as ingroup favoritism.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance and accurately explains that they use it to understand the function or role of psychological mechanisms, demonstrating understanding of both the stance and its application to evolutionary psychology.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Causal heuristics involve using factors such as distinctiveness (event A is necessary for event B to happen), plausibility (if event A takes place, event B is likely to follow), temporal and spatial contiguity (events A and B happen simultaneously and in the same location), resemblance between cause and effect (event A is similar to event B), and consistency (event B always occurs whenever event A happens).

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies distinctiveness and explains it as event A being necessary for event B, which captures the core idea that B follows A but not other events.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies consistency and explains it as event B always occurring when event A happens, which matches the answer key definition.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies plausibility and explains it as event B being likely to follow event A, which aligns with the answer key's concept of common sense plausibility.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies temporal and spatial contiguity and explains it as events happening simultaneously and in the same location, matching the answer key.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies resemblance between cause and effect and explains it as event A being similar to event B, which matches the answer key's similarity concept.

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

The availability heuristic suggests that individuals may encounter a social media algorithm that primarily shows them posts from morally outraged users, while negativity bias indicates that people are drawn to negative emotional content. Together, these factors lead to an overestimation by increasing the accessibility of negative material.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias as people being drawn to negative emotional content, which aligns with the answer key's description of seeking out or placing more weight on negative information like morally outraged content.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the availability heuristic in the context of social media algorithms showing morally outraged posts, which relates to the answer key's point about estimating frequency based on ease of recall, though the explanation could be more precise about the cognitive mechanism.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of how these biases work together to cause overestimation, mentioning that they increase accessibility of negative material, which captures the essence of the answer key's explanation about how negativity bias increases examples that the availability heuristic then uses to overestimate frequency.

Score: 1.0

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

This concept is known as the law of contagion, which suggests that if someone we dislike has come into contact with an object, anyone who touches that object afterward may take on those person's negative attributes. Biologically, we believe the object has retained cells from that individual, causing us to dislike it. Physically, we view the object as carrying or being infused with the person's negative qualities. Psychologically, we see the object as possessing undesirable traits and fear that touching it will transfer that person's negative emotional and mental characteristics to us.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that biological concepts (retaining cells, physical contamination) are being inappropriately applied to explain social/psychological phenomena (dislike, negative attributes, emotional characteristics). They demonstrate understanding that contagion from the biological domain is being misapplied to the social/psychological domain.

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A delusional conspiracy theory refers to a belief in a conspiracy that is not widely recognized or accepted by society, similar to how atheism was viewed in the past.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student only identifies one criterion (not commonly accepted) but misses the key distinction that a delusional conspiracy theory must also be an irrational belief. The answer is incomplete and doesn't fully capture what makes a conspiracy theory delusional versus non-delusional.

Score: 0.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

Your answer:

Denial of science, group identity dynamics, reaction to a threat to existence, and a simplistic personality.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions 'denial of science' which is not listed among the cognitive and personality factors in the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student mentions 'group identity dynamics' which is not specifically listed in the answer key factors.
- Correct: The student mentions 'a simplistic personality' which aligns with 'believing in simple explanations for complex events' from the answer key.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Starting from an initial reference point and making adjustments from there.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's answer describes anchoring bias, which is about starting from a reference point and making adjustments. This is unrelated to the question about how incorrect quiz answers can interfere with learning. The correct answer should involve source amnesia (forgetting that an answer was incorrect) or proactive interference (initial incorrect answers interfering with later correct ones).

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

The recency effect occurs because repeated exposure to certain information keeps it fresh in our minds, allowing it to remain in our working memory for a longer period.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the recency effect as the mechanism. The correct answer is mere exposure effect (tendency to prefer familiar things) or illusory-truth effect. The recency effect refers to better recall of recently presented items, not the psychological mechanism that makes repeated messages more attractive through familiarity.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Individuals with major depressive disorder often focus more on negative emotional information, which leads them to misjudge the likelihood of such events happening. This tendency is known as negativity bias.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that people with major depressive disorder are less accurate due to negativity bias causing them to misjudge likelihood of negative events. The answer key indicates they are actually more accurate because they show reduced optimistic bias, not that they are less accurate due to negativity bias.

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

We depend heavily on our existing beliefs, resulting in a biased view shaped solely by what we already know and anticipate.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when sensory information becomes less reliable, we depend more heavily on our existing beliefs/expectations, which aligns with the key concept that prior beliefs have increased influence on perception when sensory reliability decreases.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

Preconventional, conventional, and postconventional stages describe different bases for moral reasoning. At the preconventional level, individuals make moral decisions by considering punishments and rewards. In the conventional stage, moral judgments are influenced by social expectations and a sense of responsibility to uphold laws. At the postconventional stage, people evaluate morality according to broader ethical principles, sometimes challenging existing rules and norms.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the preconventional level as making moral decisions based on punishments and rewards, which matches the answer key's description of 'obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.'
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as being influenced by social expectations and responsibility to uphold laws, which aligns with the answer key's focus on 'social norms and other people's feelings.'
- Correct: The student correctly describes the postconventional level as evaluating morality according to broader ethical principles and sometimes challenging existing rules, which matches the answer key's description of 'abstract principles and values.'

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

Classical conditioning is a causal model that plays a role in hindsight bias. When we form a connection between two events, we tend to believe that we anticipated or "knew all along" that an outcome would occur.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly defines a causal model as classical conditioning, which is a learning mechanism, not a coherent narrative explaining how past events are related.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that causal models contribute to hindsight bias by making us believe we 'knew all along' that outcomes would occur, which aligns with the concept that events seem more inevitable than they were.

Score: 0.5

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

After knowing the actual outcome, it becomes difficult to envision a different result or recall a time when we believed the outcome might have varied. This phenomenon is known as the curse of knowledge effect.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly explains that learning new information (knowing the actual outcome) makes it difficult to recall previous beliefs or imagine different outcomes, which accurately describes how learning contributes to hindsight bias. They also correctly identify this as the curse of knowledge effect.

Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing involves aiming for the optimal choice, whereas satisficing means opting for a choice that meets acceptable standards. Neuroticism is associated with maximizing.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as 'aiming for the optimal choice' which aligns with 'trying to make the best choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as 'opting for a choice that meets acceptable standards' which matches the concept of 'making a good-enough choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that neuroticism is associated with maximizing, which matches the answer key's statement that high neuroticism leads to adopting the maximizing decision style.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

To encourage students to actively engage with the material, a peer review system could be introduced where students evaluate each other's exams and offer feedback. Additionally, financial rewards might be given to RUG employees or students interested in contributing to grading and exam correction. Finally, AI could be utilized to deliver feedback by identifying specific errors in students' responses, making it valuable for practice exams by offering real-time feedback and enhancing the learning experience.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement with the question by proposing three concrete solutions: peer review systems, financial incentives for additional grading support, and AI-assisted feedback. These suggestions show thoughtful consideration of the constraint of limited time and resources while addressing the goal of promoting active student engagement. The answer reflects practical thinking about scalable assessment methods.
