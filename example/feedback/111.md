## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

System one is more instinctive, while system two is more analytical. According to this model, system one is the predominant system.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies System 1 as 'instinctive' which aligns with the answer key's requirement for intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies System 2 as 'analytical' which corresponds to the answer key's requirement for reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student correctly states that System 1 is 'predominant' which matches the answer key's requirement that System 1 is more dominant than System 2.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

This is an example of the representativeness heuristic. We assume that the colleague is a fashion model because she resembles the typical image of one. We associate people who fit certain stereotypes with those categories, often overlooking the actual statistical likelihood.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive bias in this scenario.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that the representativeness heuristic involves estimating likelihood based on resemblance to stereotypes, and even mentions the important aspect of overlooking statistical probability.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

The primacy effect refers to our tendency to evaluate people based on our initial impression, leading to more negative judgments if that first impression was unfavorable, and more positive ones if it was favorable. This effect depends on memory and the initial impression formed. Anchoring involves having an initial reference point from which we make adjustments. Both concepts share the idea of beginning with an initial impression or starting point.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly defines anchoring as having an initial reference point for adjustments, but misses that it's specifically about the tendency to use the first piece of information as a starting point for decision-making or judgment.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly defines the primacy effect as evaluating people based on initial impressions rather than the tendency to better remember the first piece of information in a sequence.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both concepts involve starting with an initial impression or starting point, which captures the essence of overreliance on first information.

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion means we compare losses and gains, but we fear losing more than we value gaining. This causes us to avoid losses. Risk aversion refers to how we assess the dangers involved; if the risk is high, we tend to avoid it.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves weighing losses more heavily than gains and leads to avoiding losses, which matches the key concept from the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student describes risk aversion as avoiding high dangers/risks, but misses the core concept that risk aversion is about preferring certainty over uncertainty regardless of the level of risk.

Score: 0.5

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate how negatively future events will affect us. For example, people often believe that breaking up will have a much stronger and more painful impact on their emotions than it actually does. This misconception can stop individuals from ending relationships because they expect to feel extremely unhappy and distressed afterward.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as overestimating the impact of future events on feelings, though they specify 'negatively' which is slightly more narrow than the general definition but still captures the core concept.
- Correct: The student correctly explains how impact bias prevents breakups by describing that people overestimate how bad they will feel after breaking up, which matches the answer key's explanation.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves making choices based on how we think we will feel later on. However, we are often inaccurate in predicting our future emotions. End-of-life decisions, such as those concerning euthanasia due to suffering, are made with the future in mind. Yet, when individuals reach the moment to carry out euthanasia, their feelings often change. Therefore, it is crucial to consider this shift in emotions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies affective forecasting as predictions about future emotional states, though they phrase it as 'making choices based on how we think we will feel later on' which captures the essence of predicting future emotions.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of the key concept that people's actual preferences when sick may differ from their predicted preferences when healthy, specifically mentioning that feelings about end-of-life decisions like euthanasia often change when the moment arrives.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

Yes, people often underestimate events with low probabilities. Firstly, individuals generally struggle to grasp probabilistic concepts accurately. Secondly, when faced with a very small chance, such as 0.01%, we tend to believe that it won't affect us personally. As a result, this leads us to take greater risks.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student states that people underestimate low probabilities, which contradicts the answer key that merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Incorrect: The student does not distinguish between merely low probabilities and extremely low probabilities, and does not mention that extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 0.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

People place greater emphasis on losses. We rely on biases and heuristics in this process. Additionally, we often dwell excessively on these losses. Therefore, according to utility prospect theory, we tend to overanalyze and give too much weight to losses.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion means people place greater emphasis/weight on losses, which aligns with the key concept that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. While the answer includes some additional commentary about biases and overanalyzing, the core understanding of loss aversion as giving more weight to losses is accurate.

Score: 1.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Both theories are normative. Expected value theory focuses on values and is primarily useful for financial calculations and results. In contrast, expected utility theory is based on utilities and probabilities, with outcomes that can be either financial or subjective.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory focuses on financial values while expected utility theory can handle both financial and subjective (non-financial) outcomes, matching the first key point.
- Incorrect: The student does not address the distinction regarding heuristics/biases and risk aversion. They only mention that both theories use probabilities but miss the key difference about expected utility theory's consideration of risk aversion.

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected value theory is a normative model that focuses on financial outcomes and does not consider biases or heuristics. Expected utility theory is also normative, dealing with probabilities of utilities that can be either financial or subjective, and similarly ignores biases and heuristics. Multi-attribute utility theory (MAUT) is a normative model based on utilities encompassing multiple outcomes, which are weighed against each other. Prospect theory is a descriptive model that incorporates biases and heuristics, making it the most suitable model for understanding human decision-making.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as a normative model focusing on financial outcomes, which aligns with the answer key's description of choosing between options with financial outcomes and probabilities.
- Correct: The student accurately describes expected utility theory as normative, dealing with probabilities of utilities that can be financial or subjective, which matches the answer key's explanation that outcomes have utility beyond just financial value.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies MAUT as a normative model with multiple outcomes that are weighed against each other, which corresponds to the answer key's description of multiple attributes with utilities and weights.
- Correct: The student properly identifies prospect theory as a descriptive model that incorporates biases and heuristics, which aligns with the answer key's description of it being a behavioral model that considers heuristics and biases.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency to evaluate losses and gains differently, placing greater emphasis on losses. As a result, people tend to be more cautious and risk-averse because the pain of losing something feels stronger than the pleasure of gaining the same amount.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly defines loss aversion but fails to identify the key paradoxical effect described in the answer key. They argue that loss aversion makes people more risk-averse, when the correct answer is that loss aversion can actually make people risk-seeking when they are trying to avoid potential losses (i.e., people become willing to take risks to prevent losses).

Score: 0.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves linking a conditioned stimulus with an unconditioned stimulus. Classical conditioning, demonstrated by Pavlov, involves associating two stimuli to produce a specific behavior. In Pavlov's experiment, the dog receives food and hears a bell, causing it to salivate. After conditioning, the dog will salivate just by hearing the bell. In operant conditioning, an animal or person must perform a particular behavior to earn a reward, such as pulling a lever to receive a treat. The subject learns that a specific action is necessary to obtain the reward.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student defines conditioning only in terms of classical conditioning (CS-UCS pairing) rather than the broader concept of learning associations through covariation that applies to both classical and operant conditioning.
- Correct: The student correctly explains classical conditioning as associating two stimuli and provides a clear example with Pavlov's dog experiment, demonstrating understanding that things happening together in time and space become associated.
- Correct: The student accurately describes operant conditioning as learning that specific actions lead to rewards, using the lever-pulling example to illustrate how actions cause consequences.

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation occurs when we mistakenly believe that two events are causally connected. For example, we might assume that the rise in ice cream sales during summer causes an increase in drownings, which is incorrect. Illusory correlation refers to the false perception that two variables are related when, in reality, they are not.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly distinguishes between illusory causation (mistakenly believing events are causally connected when they're merely correlated) and illusory correlation (perceiving a relationship between variables that don't actually correlate). The ice cream and drowning example effectively illustrates illusory causation, showing understanding that correlation was misinterpreted as causation.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

Taking an inburgeringsexamen and understanding the Dutch healthcare system is an example of a script, while knowing how to behave appropriately is a schema. A script is a type of schema related to a specific, common situation and can vary between cultures. Since the Netherlands has a different culture than the one people come from, the test helps guide behavior in typical Dutch cultural contexts. In contrast, a schema is a general, non-culture-specific concept about how the world functions. For instance, birthday celebrations occur worldwide, and respectful behavior during them is expected, which aligns more closely with the idea of a schema.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the healthcare system as a script when it should be a schema. The healthcare system represents knowledge structures and relationships between concepts, not sequential behaviors in a specific situation.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies birthday party behavior as a schema when it should be a script. Birthday party behavior involves specific sequential actions and social expectations for a particular situation, which defines a script, not a general knowledge structure.

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

There are three perspectives: the mechanical stance, the physical stance, and the intentional stance. Psychologists concentrate on how specific stimuli lead to particular behaviors, which aligns with the mechanical stance. They examine the way various stimuli cause certain behaviors, focusing solely on how the mechanism operates without considering the intentions behind the resulting behavior.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies behaviorists as adopting the 'mechanical stance' rather than the physical stance. While they correctly describe behaviorists' focus on stimulus-response relationships, they misapply Dennett's terminology. The physical stance refers to understanding behavior through physical processes and mechanisms, which is what behaviorists actually adopted.

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

They take the intentional stance, which allows them to understand others' intentions and respond appropriately. By favoring people from their own group and reacting correctly, this approach fosters supportive communities and friendships.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the intentional stance instead of the design stance. The intentional stance involves attributing beliefs and desires to predict behavior, while evolutionary psychology adopts the design stance by analyzing psychological processes in terms of their evolutionary function and adaptive purpose.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

We utilize confirmation bias by focusing solely on information that supports one aspect of the hypothesis, ignoring the opposing side. Similarly, positivity bias leads us to seek only evidence that aligns with the hypothesis. Conversely, negativity bias involves searching exclusively for evidence that contradicts the hypothesis. We examine whether event A amplifies or causes event B.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student does not mention distinctness/specificity. Instead, they discuss confirmation bias, which is unrelated to the heuristic of whether B follows A but not other events.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention consistency. They discuss positivity bias instead, which is not related to whether B always follows A.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention plausibility. They discuss negativity bias, which is not about common sense plausibility of causation.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention contiguity in time and space. There is no discussion of temporal or spatial proximity between events A and B.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention similarity in cause and effect. The brief mention of examining whether A 'amplifies or causes' B does not address superficial resemblance between cause and effect.

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Individuals from the dark triad tend to share content that provokes moral outrage, which is frequently reposted by others. As a result, this type of content appears often in our feeds. The availability heuristic contributes to this because repeated exposure makes these memories easier to remember. Additionally, the negativity heuristic leads us to perceive the world as more bleak and negative than it actually is, which further explains the prevalence of morally outraged individuals on social media platforms.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student does not correctly identify or define the negativity bias. Instead, they mention a 'negativity heuristic' and describe it as making us perceive the world as more negative, rather than our tendency to seek out or place more weight on negative information.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the availability heuristic and demonstrates understanding that repeated exposure to moral outrage content makes these examples more easily recalled, leading to overestimation of frequency.
- Incorrect: While the student discusses how content appears frequently in feeds and mentions both biases, they do not clearly explain the causal mechanism of how the negativity bias increases attention to morally outraged content, which then provides more examples for the availability heuristic to operate on.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

We tend to avoid using items that once belonged to people we dislike because we know they were owned by someone we have negative feelings toward.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's answer describes the phenomenon but fails to explain it in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge. The answer key requires explaining how biological domain concepts (contagion) are incorrectly applied to social/psychological domains, but the student only provides a surface-level description without addressing domain-specific frameworks or the misapplication of biological concepts.

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A delusional conspiracy theory is one that is held by a very limited group and lacks cultural acceptance. In contrast, a non-delusional conspiracy theory is also a conspiracy theory but is embraced by a larger audience. For instance, the belief among some Muslims that the 9/11 attacks were orchestrated by Americans is a conspiracy theory, but because it is widely accepted within that community, it is considered a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly identifies that lack of common acceptance is a factor distinguishing delusional from non-delusional conspiracy theories, but completely omits the crucial criterion of irrationality. The answer key requires BOTH irrational belief AND lack of common acceptance for a theory to be considered delusional, but the student only addresses the acceptance aspect.

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

Most individuals who tend to believe in conspiracy theories generally have lower income, less education, and are less likely to reside in affluent neighborhoods.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions 'less education' which could relate to low intelligence/analytical thinking from the answer key, but this connection is not explicit enough and the focus is on educational attainment rather than cognitive factors.
- Incorrect: The student mentions 'lower income' which is a socioeconomic factor not listed in the answer key of cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking.
- Incorrect: The student mentions 'less likely to reside in affluent neighborhoods' which is another socioeconomic/demographic factor not included in the answer key of cognitive and personality factors.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Anchoring and adjusting involves beginning with an incorrect answer, which serves as the anchor. After recognizing the mistake, you review your material more thoroughly and acquire new information. You then revise your initial incorrect answer, leading to a more accurate and improved response.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes anchoring and adjusting, which is not the correct psychological mechanism. The answer key requires explanation of source amnesia (forgetting that an incorrect answer was wrong and mistaking it for correct), proactive interference (initial incorrect answer interfering with later correct answer), or the continued-influence effect. The student's explanation describes a positive learning process rather than how incorrect answers can interfere with learning.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

They keep repeating their statements to implant them in your mind. When you hear the same phrases repeatedly, your brain remembers them more quickly and easily since they are more readily accessible. This is known as the availability heuristic. Additionally, hearing these statements multiple times boosts the speed at which you recall them.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student only describes the availability heuristic and memory accessibility, but fails to identify the key psychological mechanism asked for: mere exposure effect (preference for familiar things) or illusory-truth effect. The answer focuses on memory recall rather than how repetition makes messages more attractive.

Score: 0.0

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Individuals with major depressive disorder often have difficulty making accurate predictions. Their depressive state causes them to view the world more negatively than it actually is, leading them to rely on a negativity bias when making decisions. As a result, they tend to overestimate the likelihood of adverse events occurring, even though this perception is inaccurate.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that people with major depressive disorder are less accurate and overestimate bad events due to negativity bias. The answer key indicates they are actually more accurate because they show reduced optimistic bias, not increased negativity bias.

Score: 0.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

When the reliability of sensory information declines, we receive fewer sensory inputs than previously. This can affect our beliefs. Although the amount of sensory information decreases, our expectations remain unchanged initially. As a result, our prior beliefs are adjusted to reflect a lower expectation.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that prior beliefs are 'adjusted to reflect a lower expectation' when sensory reliability decreases. The correct concept is that prior beliefs maintain greater influence on perception when sensory information is unreliable, not that the beliefs themselves are adjusted downward.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

Kohlberg's theory consists of three stages of development. The first is the pre-conventional level, where behavior is motivated by the desire to gain rewards and avoid punishment. The second stage is the conventional level, which involves a deeper understanding of social rules. The final stage is the post-conventional level, where moral reasoning is fully developed.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the pre-conventional level and accurately describes it as being motivated by desire to gain rewards and avoid punishment, which matches the answer key description.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the conventional level and describes it as involving understanding of social rules, which aligns with the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Incorrect: While the student correctly identifies the post-conventional level, the description 'where moral reasoning is fully developed' is too vague and doesn't capture the key aspect of focusing on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model of past events involves understanding that event A in the past can influence, prevent, or cause event B. This new knowledge forms a causal framework. This process is linked with hindsight bias, where after learning that event A caused, prevented, or affected event B, we tend to believe we "all saw it coming," even though prior to knowing this causal connection, we were uncertain.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes a causal model as understanding how events are causally connected (A influences/causes B) and mentions it forms a framework, which aligns with the concept of a coherent narrative of related past events.
- Correct: The student accurately explains how causal models contribute to hindsight bias by describing the 'we all saw it coming' phenomenon, where learning causal connections makes past events seem more predictable than they actually were, which matches the key point about events seeming more inevitable.

Score: 1.0

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Hindsight bias is the tendency to believe, after an event has occurred, that we predicted it all along, even though we didn't actually foresee it at the time. Throughout the event, we acquire new information, such as how people play football. We then draw on these memories formed during the experience, along with the availability heuristic, which makes these recent memories more accessible. Ultimately, we rely on this ease of recall to form our judgment.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes hindsight bias and mentions acquiring new information, but fails to address the key mechanism that learning contributes to hindsight bias - that when estimating past likelihood judgments, one cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. The student focuses on availability heuristic and ease of recall rather than the inability to separate new knowledge from past judgments.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximising involves aiming to make the optimal choice, while satisficing means settling for a decision that is acceptable or sufficient. Someone with high levels of neuroticism tends to favor maximising, striving to find the best possible option.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as aiming to make the optimal choice, which aligns with 'trying to make the best choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as settling for a decision that is acceptable or sufficient, which matches 'making a good-enough choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that someone with high neuroticism tends to favor maximizing, which matches the answer key's expectation.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

During your lectures, you can create a quiz or kahoot to encourage active engagement with the material, possibly offering a reward at the end. Another approach is to have students write some exam questions based on the content, and if any are well-made, you can include them in the exam. If time and resources are limited, opting for a multiple-choice exam is practical, as it requires less time for grading and feedback. Alongside the multiple-choice test, you could incorporate a paper with peer review. AI can be utilized to assist in generating questions and creating an answer key. Another option is combining presentations with a multiple-choice exam: you can grade the presentations while AI handles the multiple-choice grading. However, presentations might lead to ingroup favoritism, which can be minimized by adding a peer review component.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement with the question by providing multiple concrete, practical strategies for encouraging active engagement while managing time and resource constraints. They discuss interactive lecture techniques (quizzes, Kahoot), student-generated content (exam questions), efficient assessment methods (multiple-choice), peer review systems, AI assistance, and hybrid approaches combining presentations with automated grading. The answer also shows critical thinking by acknowledging potential issues like ingroup favoritism and suggesting solutions. This comprehensive response clearly reflects thoughtful consideration of the pedagogical challenge presented.
