Grade: 7.0

## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidtâ€™s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

System 1 describes moral reasoning as instinctive, automatic, and inherent, while System 2 views it as a conscious, rational process. In Haidt's social-intuitionist model, he suggests that moral reasoning is primarily driven by emotions and the impact of our actions on others, which aligns with System 1.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies System 1 as 'instinctive, automatic, and inherent' which aligns with the answer key's description of System 1 as intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies System 2 as 'conscious, rational process' which matches the answer key's description of System 2 as reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student states that 'moral reasoning is primarily driven by emotions' which indicates System 1 dominance, consistent with the answer key's requirement that System 1 is more dominant than System 2.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

This illustrates the representativeness heuristic, a cognitive shortcut where we assume that a person is likely part of a certain category because they resemble our internal image or prototype of that group.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process in this scenario.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that the representativeness heuristic involves estimating category membership based on resemblance to a prototype or internal image of that group, which matches the key concept of resembling stereotypes.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring occurs when an initial piece of information serves as a reference point for interpreting all subsequent information. The primacy effect refers to the tendency to remember items at the start of a list more clearly and to give greater weight to initial information when forming impressions. Both primacy effect and anchoring emphasize the significance of the first information encountered. This idea is particularly relevant in impression formation, where the primacy effect highlights how early information about a person acts as an anchor.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines anchoring as using initial information as a reference point, which aligns with the answer key's definition of taking the first piece of information as the starting point.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as the tendency to remember items at the start of a list more clearly, which matches the answer key's definition of better remembering the first piece of information.
- Correct: The student clearly identifies that both effects emphasize the significance of first information encountered, which corresponds to the answer key's point about overreliance on the first piece of information.

Score: 1.0

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the preference for avoiding losses and the tendency to steer clear of losing when making choices. In contrast, risk aversion is the inclination to avoid or withdraw from taking risks.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves preferring to avoid losses, which aligns with the key concept that losses are weighted more heavily than gains.
- Incorrect: The student defines risk aversion as avoiding or withdrawing from taking risks, but misses the core concept that risk aversion is specifically about preferring certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 0.5

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias is a cognitive mistake where we exaggerate the emotional effects of an event, either in how long the feelings will last or how intense they will be. For example, someone in a toxic relationship may delay ending it because they overpredict the length and intensity of the pain they will feel after the breakup.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as overestimating emotional effects of future events, specifically mentioning both intensity and duration of feelings, which aligns with the answer key's definition.
- Correct: The student provides a clear example showing how impact bias prevents breakups by explaining that people overpredict the pain they'll feel, which matches the answer key's point about overestimating how bad a breakup will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves anticipating our future emotional experiences and how upcoming events might impact our feelings. This concept is significant in end-of-life decision-making because a person might be certain about choosing assisted suicide in the future, yet their feelings could change once they actually reach that stage in life.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies affective forecasting as predicting future emotional experiences and feelings about upcoming events, which aligns with the answer key's definition of predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of the key concept by explaining that people might be certain about choosing assisted suicide when healthy, but their feelings could change when actually facing that situation, which matches the answer key's point about healthy people predicting they'd prefer to die when sick but potentially feeling differently when actually sick.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

People often overestimate probabilities that are low, like 10%, while they tend to underestimate probabilities that are extremely low, such as 0.1%.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that merely low probabilities (like 10%) are overestimated, which matches the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student states that extremely low probabilities are underestimated, but the answer key indicates they are treated as impossibilities (ignored/neglected), not simply underestimated.

Score: 0.5

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Prospect theory highlights our natural inclination to steer clear of losses. When looking at utility, avoiding losses can be seen as a form of positive utility.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes loss aversion as avoiding losses providing positive utility, but misses the key concept that loss aversion specifically means negative utilities (losses) are weighted more heavily than equivalent positive utilities (gains). The answer doesn't capture the asymmetric weighting or steeper slope for losses versus gains.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory focuses solely on financial choices, whereas expected utility theory extends to include non-financial decisions as well. Additionally, expected utility theory takes into account aspects like loss aversion, which expected value theory overlooks.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory focuses on financial choices while expected utility theory extends to non-financial decisions, which matches the first point in the answer key.
- Correct: The student mentions that expected utility theory considers loss aversion while expected value theory does not, which aligns with the answer key's point about expected utility theory considering risk aversion and heuristics/biases that expected value theory overlooks.

Score: 1.0

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesnâ€™t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

The expected value model is a normative approach focused on selecting the option that maximizes monetary returns. Expected utility theory, also normative, involves choosing the option with the highest overall value, which may be subjective and not strictly financial. The multi-attribute utility model expands on expected utility theory by evaluating various characteristics of the options and assigning individual subjective importance to each. Prospect theory, a descriptive model, extends expected utility theory by incorporating the influence of heuristics and cognitive biases.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as a normative model focused on maximizing monetary returns, which aligns with the answer key's description of financial outcomes with probabilities.
- Correct: The student accurately describes expected utility theory as normative and involving subjective value beyond just financial outcomes, matching the answer key's explanation.
- Correct: The student correctly explains multi-attribute utility theory as evaluating various characteristics with individual subjective importance, which corresponds to the answer key's description of multiple attributes with utilities and weights.
- Correct: The student properly identifies prospect theory as a descriptive model that extends expected utility theory by incorporating heuristics and cognitive biases, matching the answer key exactly.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease peopleâ€™s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Individuals experience greater fear from losses than pleasure from equivalent gains. When outcomes are presented as potential losses, people generally become more cautious and risk-averse.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that people become more risk-averse when facing potential losses, which is the opposite of what the answer key requires. The key point is that loss aversion actually decreases risk aversion and can make people risk-seeking when trying to avoid losses.

Score: 0.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves forming connections between events. Classical conditioning refers to learning the relationship between two stimuli, while operant conditioning involves understanding that actions lead to specific outcomes, such as rewards or punishments.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as forming connections/associations between events, which aligns with the answer key's definition of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as learning relationships between stimuli, which matches the answer key's explanation of associating things that happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as understanding that actions lead to outcomes like rewards or punishments, which directly corresponds to the answer key's definition.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation occurs when individuals incorrectly assume that event A causes event B. Illusory correlation refers to perceiving a relationship between events A and B that may not actually exist, as either event could influence the other.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly identifies that illusory causation involves incorrectly assuming causation, but fails to specify that this occurs when there is actually a correlation that gets misinterpreted as causal. For illusory correlation, the student incorrectly describes it as events that 'may not actually exist' and suggests either could influence the other, rather than understanding it as perceiving correlation between variables that don't actually correlate at all.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to â€˜properlyâ€™ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

The schema involves having a general understanding of how the Dutch healthcare system operates, including what to anticipate and how to use it effectively. A script refers to the culturally specific behaviors expected at a Dutch birthday party, such as the appropriate times to sing "happy birthday" or when guests typically open presents.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the Dutch healthcare system as a schema and provides appropriate reasoning that it involves general understanding and knowledge of how the system operates, which aligns with schemas being knowledge structures about relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies birthday party behavior as a script and provides good examples of specific behavioral expectations (singing happy birthday, opening presents timing), demonstrating understanding that scripts are situation-specific behavioral sequences.

Score: 1.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

Behaviorists may take the intentional stance, which involves examining a person's motives, emotions, behaviors, desires, and intentions. They focus on understanding the reasons behind an individual's actions in response to certain stimuli.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the intentional stance, which focuses on beliefs, desires, and mental states. Behaviorists explicitly rejected studying mental states and instead adopted the physical stance by focusing on observable stimulus-response relationships and the mechanical processes that produce behavior.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

An evolutionary psychologist may take a functionalist approach by examining how specific behaviors serve to protect the human species and how they contribute to evolutionary adaptation.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes what evolutionary psychologists do (examining how behaviors serve protective/adaptive functions) but does not identify which of Dennett's stances they adopt. The answer key specifically requires identifying the 'design stance' as the level of analysis used by evolutionary psychologists.

Score: 0.0

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Distinctiveness (specificity) â€“ It is important to confirm that B is specifically caused by A. Plausibility â€“ The cause-and-effect relationship between A and B should be reasonable. Contiguity in time and space â€“ B should happen shortly after A and within the same setting or physical surroundings. Exactness â€“

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies distinctiveness/specificity and provides an accurate explanation that B should be specifically caused by A, matching the answer key concept that B follows A but not other events.
- Incorrect: Student does not mention consistency, which requires that B always follows A according to the answer key.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies plausibility and provides an accurate explanation that the cause-and-effect relationship should be reasonable, matching the answer key.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies contiguity in time and space and provides an accurate explanation that B should happen shortly after A in the same setting, matching the answer key.
- Incorrect: Student mentions 'exactness' but provides no explanation and does not identify the fifth heuristic of similarity in cause and effect from the answer key.

Score: 0.6

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Negativity bias is a cognitive mistake where we focus on negative emotions, leading us to perceive the world as more bleak than it truly is. Confirmation bias happens when we look for information that supports our existing beliefs and ignore information that contradicts them. Negativity bias drives people to seek out negative posts, causing them to view social media as a platform for moral outrage. Then, confirmation bias reinforces this perception by making individuals concentrate on the negative content, further solidifying their belief that social media is a hub for moral outrage.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias and explains how it leads people to focus on negative content, including morally outraged posts on social media.
- Incorrect: The student identifies confirmation bias instead of the availability heuristic. While confirmation bias is a real cognitive bias, the answer key specifically requires the availability heuristic as the second bias.
- Incorrect: The student does not explain the mechanism by which the availability heuristic works (estimating frequency based on ease of recall). Instead, they describe how confirmation bias reinforces existing beliefs, which doesn't address how we overestimate the actual number of outraged people.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

Magical contagion suggests that harmful qualities or essences can be passed between objects, regardless of logical reasoning. Similarly, framework theories involve using knowledge from one area to understand another, even when this crossover is inaccurate.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that magical contagion involves applying concepts from one domain (biological contagion where harmful substances can transfer) to another domain (social/psychological) where this transfer doesn't logically apply, which aligns with the answer key's point about incorrectly applying biological domain concepts to the social domain.

Score: 1.0

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A delusional conspiracy theory differs from a typical conspiracy theory because it is not based on natural laws or religious beliefs. It can also be considered delusional if it involves a belief that is inconsistent with what society is willing to accept at that particular moment.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions societal acceptance as one criterion, which partially aligns with the answer key's 'not commonly accepted' requirement. However, the student fails to identify that a delusional conspiracy theory must be an 'irrational belief' and incorrectly introduces irrelevant criteria about natural laws and religious beliefs that are not part of the correct definition.

Score: 0.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

self-centered characteristics, limited intelligence, sense of isolation

Feedback:

- Correct: Self-centered characteristics corresponds to narcissistic tendencies mentioned in the answer key.
- Correct: Limited intelligence matches the low level of intelligence factor from the answer key.
- Incorrect: Sense of isolation is not mentioned in the answer key as one of the cognitive and personality factors discussed.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you donâ€™t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

processing power

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The answer 'processing power' does not address any of the psychological mechanisms mentioned in the answer key (source amnesia, proactive interference, or continued-influence effect). Processing power is not a relevant psychological mechanism for how incorrect answers interfere with learning.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

They aim to enhance the appeal of their message by utilizing the mere exposure effect. The more frequently individuals or voters encounter a belief or message, the more inclined they are to adopt it as their own.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the mere exposure effect as the psychological mechanism, which matches the answer key. They also demonstrate understanding by explaining that repeated exposure leads to increased preference/adoption of the message.

Score: 1.0

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Individuals with depression tend to assess the likelihood of negative events more accurately than those without depression. This is due to the absence of a positivity bias in depressed individuals, which normally leads people to underestimate the risks they face.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people with depression are more accurate at predicting negative events and explains this is due to the absence of positivity bias (equivalent to reduced optimism bias), which matches the answer key's explanation about reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Score: 1.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

The previous knowledge or anticipation holds more sway.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that prior beliefs (previous knowledge/anticipation) have increased influence when sensory information becomes less reliable, which matches the key concept from the answer key.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You donâ€™t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other peopleâ€™s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

The initial stage is the pre-conventional level, where individuals understand moral behavior based on rewards and punishments. The following stage, the conventional level, involves recognizing how one's actions impact others. The last stage, the post-conventional level, reflects a deeper comprehension of morality, acknowledging that people can hold differing and sometimes conflicting values.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the pre-conventional level and accurately describes it as focusing on rewards and punishments, which aligns with the answer key's description of obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the conventional level and describes it as recognizing how actions impact others, which corresponds well with the answer key's description of focusing on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the post-conventional level and describes it as involving deeper comprehension of morality with acknowledgment of differing values, which aligns with the answer key's description of focusing on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Score: 0.0

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Learning plays a role in hindsight bias. Once an event has happened, we keep absorbing new information, which causes us to adjust our beliefs in a way that makes it seem like we "knew it all along" based on what we currently understand. However, the beliefs we had before the event could have been entirely different.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that newly learned information cannot be avoided when estimating past likelihood judgments, which is the core mechanism of how learning contributes to hindsight bias. They explain that new information causes us to adjust our beliefs retroactively, making past events seem more predictable than they actually were.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

The maximizing style involves striving to consistently choose the optimal option. In contrast, the satisficing style refers to individuals who are satisfied with selecting an option that is merely adequate. A person with neurotic traits is often a maximizer, as they tend to be perfectionistic and experience regret over their decisions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as striving to choose the optimal option, which aligns with 'trying to make the best choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as being satisfied with selecting an adequate option, which matches 'making a good-enough choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that neurotic individuals tend to be maximizers and provides valid reasoning about perfectionism and regret, which supports the answer key point.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

Various nudges can be implemented to boost student participation. For instance, creating a system where students' participation is visible to both their classmates and the professor could encourage more engagement. When completing assigned readings, students could be required to add annotations that are accessible to everyone in the class and the instructor. Additionally, group projects could include a rule that each student's individual input must be clearly distinguishable from others', ensuring that all members contribute actively since their efforts are visible to peers and the professor.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement by providing specific, practical solutions to the challenge of promoting student engagement with limited resources. They propose visibility-based nudges (public annotations, distinguishable individual contributions in group work) that leverage social accountability without requiring intensive personalized feedback from the instructor. The answer shows understanding of behavioral principles and addresses the constraint of limited time/resources effectively.
