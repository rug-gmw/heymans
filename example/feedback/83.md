## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidtâ€™s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

According to this model, System 1 thinking is the most influential because the social intuitionist model suggests that individuals depend largely on instincts and emotions when forming moral judgments. System 1 is guided by feelings and intuition, while System 2 typically intervenes only after decisions have been made, providing justifications for the choices retrospectively.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 is guided by feelings and intuition, which aligns with the answer key's requirement that System 1 refers to intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student implicitly describes System 2 as providing justifications and intervening after decisions are made, which corresponds to the reasoning/rational thought function described in the answer key.
- Correct: The student clearly states that System 1 thinking is 'the most influential' and that individuals 'depend largely on instincts and emotions,' correctly identifying System 1 as dominant over System 2.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

This describes the representativeness heuristic, which is the tendency for individuals to assess the probability that an object or person fits into a specific category by comparing how closely they resemble the typical examples of that category.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process in this scenario.
- Correct: The student provides an accurate explanation of the representativeness heuristic, describing how we assess probability of category membership based on resemblance to typical examples, which matches the key concept of estimating likelihood based on stereotypical resemblance.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring is the concept that people start with an initial set of beliefs, called an anchor, and then adjust their understanding of new information based on this starting point. The primacy effect describes how individuals give more importance to traits introduced at the start of a series and assess subsequent traits in relation to those initial ones. Both anchoring and the primacy effect show how early impressions significantly shape the way later information is interpreted and handled.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as starting with an initial reference point (anchor) and adjusting from there, which matches the key concept of taking the first piece of information as the starting point.
- Incorrect: The student describes the primacy effect as giving more importance to initial traits and assessing subsequent ones in relation to them, but misses the key aspect that it's about better remembering the first piece of information.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both concepts involve early impressions significantly shaping how later information is interpreted, which aligns with overreliance on the first piece of information.

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

In loss aversion, individuals prioritize avoiding losses over acquiring gains. In contrast, risk aversion involves a desire to avoid uncertainty and safeguard existing gains, leading to behaviors that minimize the chance of losing. However, with loss aversion, the fear of losses can be so strong that people may actually take greater risks, becoming risk-seeking.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves prioritizing avoiding losses over acquiring gains, which aligns with the answer key's definition of weighing losses more heavily than gains.
- Incorrect: The student confuses risk aversion with loss aversion by describing it as avoiding uncertainty to 'safeguard existing gains' and 'minimize the chance of losing,' when risk aversion is simply the preference for certainty over uncertainty, regardless of gains or losses.

Score: 0.5

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias refers to the tendency of individuals to exaggerate how long and how strongly they will feel emotions in the future. This bias can make people reluctant to end relationships because they expect to experience prolonged and intense sadness or heartbreak, which they want to avoid. However, in reality, these emotions are usually less severe and shorter-lived than anticipated.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies impact bias as the tendency to overestimate future emotional responses, which aligns with the answer key's definition of overestimating the impact of future events on feelings.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that impact bias prevents breakups because people overestimate how bad they will feel, expecting prolonged and intense sadness that they want to avoid.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves individuals anticipating how they will feel in the future. While people can generally predict whether their emotions will be positive or negative, they often overestimate how strong and long-lasting these feelings will be. This is a crucial factor to keep in mind in end-of-life decisions, as patients frequently exaggerate the negativity they expect to experience near the end, and when that time arrives, they may reconsider or find they still wish to continue living.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines affective forecasting as anticipating how one will feel in the future, which matches the answer key's definition of predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Correct: The student accurately captures the key concept that people may predict negative experiences (preferring death when sick) but then change their perspective when actually facing the situation, demonstrating understanding of the discrepancy between predicted and actual preferences in end-of-life contexts.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

People tend to overrate small chances, yet they often view extremely unlikely events as impossible and usually fail to prepare at all if such events occur.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people 'overrate small chances,' which aligns with the answer key point that merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Correct: The student accurately describes that people 'view extremely unlikely events as impossible,' which directly matches the answer key point about extremely low probabilities being interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion describes the tendency for individuals to give more importance to losses than to equivalent gains, indicating a bias in how they assign value to outcomes.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion means losses are given more importance/weight than equivalent gains, which directly corresponds to the answer key's point that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected utility theory considers subjective utility rather than just financial results. Additionally, it is a more personal approach, as it enables individuals to assess probabilities according to their preferences and personal requirements, instead of focusing solely on financial gain.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected utility theory considers subjective utility beyond just financial results, which aligns with the answer key point about expected utility dealing with non-financial values while expected value theory deals only with financial values.
- Incorrect: The student mentions personal preferences and assessment of probabilities but does not specifically address risk aversion or heuristics and biases as stated in the answer key. The response is too general and doesn't capture the specific distinction about risk aversion.

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesnâ€™t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected value theory suggests that when choosing between options, individuals select the one that maximizes the expected value over time, with each option having an associated value and probability. Expected utility theory operates on a similar concept but incorporates subjective utility instead of just monetary outcomes, assigning a utility and probability to each option. Multiple attribute expected utility theory extends this idea by considering several attributes for each option, where each attribute carries a utility and weight, allowing for decision-making based on multiple factors. These three theories serve as normative models, which do not accurately predict actual economic behavior. In contrast, prospect theory is a descriptive model that assumes people weigh losses more heavily than gains, exhibit consistent biases in decision-making, and display systematic errors in evaluating probabilities.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as selecting options that maximize expected value, with each option having associated value and probability. This matches the answer key's description of a normative model with financial outcomes and probabilities.
- Correct: The student accurately describes expected utility theory as similar to expected value theory but incorporating subjective utility instead of just monetary outcomes. This aligns with the answer key's explanation of outcomes having utility that can be subjective rather than financial.
- Correct: The student correctly explains multi-attribute utility theory as considering several attributes for each option, with each attribute having utility and weight. This matches the answer key's description of multiple attributes with utilities and weights.
- Correct: The student properly identifies prospect theory as a descriptive model and mentions key behavioral aspects like loss aversion and systematic biases. While they don't explicitly compare it to expected utility theory as the answer key does, they capture the essential descriptive/behavioral nature and mention heuristics and biases.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease peopleâ€™s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency for individuals to prioritize avoiding losses over acquiring gains, while being risk averse means people generally prefer to steer clear of risky situations. Therefore, the stronger emphasis on losses intensifies their inclination to avoid taking risks.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that loss aversion intensifies risk aversion, when in fact loss aversion can make people risk-seeking when trying to avoid losses. The student misses the key insight that people become willing to accept risk to avoid potential losses.

Score: 0.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves learning by making connections. Classical conditioning is when a neutral stimulus becomes linked to a conditioned response. Operant conditioning is learning which actions lead to rewards or punishments.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as a form of learning that involves making connections/associations, which aligns with the key concept of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of classical conditioning by explaining how a neutral stimulus becomes linked to a response, which captures the essence of learning associations when things happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student accurately describes operant conditioning as learning which actions lead to rewards or punishments, directly matching the answer key's definition.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation is the tendency for people to infer a cause-and-effect relationship from just a correlation. Illusory correlation involves mistakenly linking two events, leading people to believe they occur together when they actually don't or when there isn't enough evidence to support that conclusion.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly distinguishes between illusory causation (inferring causation from correlation) and illusory correlation (perceiving correlation between variables that don't actually correlate or lack sufficient evidence). The definitions align well with the answer key, though expressed in slightly different terms.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to â€˜properlyâ€™ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

A schema is a mental shortcut that helps individuals make decisions quickly and enhances our comprehension of the world. In this case, the schema refers to the functioning of the Dutch system. A script is a culturally specific schema outlining the steps required for a particular event to occur, designed to direct people's behavior in various situations, such as how to act at a birthday party in this example.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that understanding the Dutch healthcare system is a schema and provides an accurate explanation that schemas help with comprehension of the world and decision-making, which aligns with the answer key's explanation about knowledge and relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script and accurately explains that scripts are culturally specific schemas that outline steps and direct behavior in particular situations, which matches the answer key's description of scripts as social schemas for specific situations.

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

Behaviorists argued that introspection and subjective experiences should be ignored when analyzing behavior, making the intentional stance unsuitable in their view since it considers motivations and intentions. They prioritized examining direct, observable, and external behaviors to understand psychological processes. Consequently, behaviorists embraced a mechanical perspective, concentrating on the physical aspects and how stimuli elicit behaviors.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that behaviorists adopted the physical stance and provides accurate reasoning - they focused on observable, mechanical aspects of how stimuli cause behaviors rather than mental states or intentions. While they don't use the exact phrase 'processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior,' their explanation demonstrates understanding that behaviorists examined the direct physical/mechanical relationship between stimuli and behavioral responses.

Score: 1.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

Evolutionary psychologists adopted a design perspective by concentrating on the functional aspects of mental processes. They sought to understand why a particular psychological mechanism would have been advantageous for our ancestors and continues to benefit us today.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance/perspective and accurately explains that they focus on the functional aspects of psychological processes, understanding why mechanisms would have been advantageous - which aligns perfectly with the answer key's emphasis on considering processes in terms of their function.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

1. Distinctiveness (specificity) - A is likely the cause of B if B occurs solely after A. 2. Plausibility - A is likely the cause of B when it is reasonable to believe that A leads to B. 3. Consistency - A is likely the cause of B if B consistently happens after A. 4. Contiguity in time and space - A is likely the cause of B when B occurs shortly after A and is located in the same spatial context. 5. Similarity in cause and effect - A is likely the cause of B when A and B exhibit similar outward features.

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies distinctiveness/specificity and explains it as B occurring solely after A, which matches the key concept that B follows A but not other events.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies plausibility and provides an accurate explanation that it's reasonable to believe A leads to B, matching the common sense criterion.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies consistency and explains it as B consistently happening after A, which aligns with the answer key's 'B always follows A.'
- Correct: Student correctly identifies contiguity in time and space, explaining it as B occurring shortly after A in the same spatial context, which matches the answer key's simultaneous occurrence criterion.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies similarity in cause and effect and explains it as A and B exhibiting similar outward features, which aligns with the superficial resemblance criterion.

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

The availability heuristic describes how people estimate the frequency of events based on how easily examples come to mind. On social media, morally outraged posts tend to be widely shared, and when users interact with these posts, algorithms continue to show similar content. This can cause people to mistakenly believe that such outrage is common, even though only a small number of users share it. Additionally, the negativity bias means that people are drawn to content with negative emotional impact, which can make them perceive reality as worse than it is. Those who seek out and engage with morally outraged content may have their view of reality skewed as a result.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies and explains the negativity bias as people being drawn to negative content, which aligns with the answer key's definition of seeking out or placing more weight on negative information like morally outraged content.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the availability heuristic as estimating frequency of events based on how easily examples come to mind, which matches the answer key's definition perfectly.
- Correct: The student effectively connects how these biases work together - explaining that social media algorithms amplify morally outraged content (negativity bias effect) leading to overestimation of its prevalence (availability heuristic), which demonstrates understanding of their interaction.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

Magical contagion effects occur because individuals apply their understanding from one general area to another unrelated area. Framework theories involve widely held, common-sense beliefs about three key fields (psychology/culture, physics, biology) that help people interpret their surroundings. Here, mental or psychological traits are assigned to an inanimate object.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that magical contagion involves applying understanding from one domain (biological contagion) to another domain (social/psychological), which matches the answer key's requirement about incorrectly applying biological domain concepts to the social/psychological domain.

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A delusional conspiracy theory is one that lacks factual basis and is illogical. In contrast, a non-delusional theory is grounded in solid reasoning and is communicated convincingly, making it easier for people to believe and accept.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly identifies that delusional conspiracy theories lack factual basis and are illogical, but misses the key criterion of social acceptance. The answer key specifies that a conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both irrational AND not commonly accepted, while the student focuses only on logical reasoning and convincing communication without addressing the social acceptance component.

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

As a man, displaying belief perseverance and traits of narcissistic personality.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'being a man' as one of the cognitive/personality factors contributing to conspiratorial thinking from the answer key.
- Incorrect: While 'belief perseverance' is related to conspiratorial thinking, it is not specifically listed among the factors in the answer key. The closest match would be 'believing in simple explanations for complex events' but this doesn't directly correspond.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'narcissistic' traits, which matches 'being narcissistic' from the answer key as a personality factor contributing to conspiratorial thinking.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you donâ€™t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Continued influence describes the phenomenon where statements persist in affecting people's thinking even after they have been withdrawn. Here, the wrong answers might hinder learning because they get stored in memory, causing the incorrect information to resurface whenever a student tries to recall the correct answer.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the continued-influence effect as a mechanism by which incorrect answers can interfere with learning. They accurately describe how incorrect information persists in memory and can resurface during recall, which matches the alternative answer provided in the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

They rely on the concept that once information is stored in memory, it is challenging for individuals to simply "unlearn" it. This effect persists even when people are aware that the information is false or has been withdrawn. This approach exploits the "continued influence" phenomenon.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes the continued influence effect, which relates to the persistence of misinformation in memory. However, this does not address the specific psychological mechanism asked about - how repetition makes messages more attractive. The answer key expects mere exposure effect or illusory-truth effect, both of which explain how repetition increases preference or perceived truthfulness, not the persistence of information in memory.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Individuals experiencing depression often perceive the world pessimistically and tend to have persistent negative thoughts. When assessing the chances of a negative event occurring, they are more prone to recalling negative examples, which leads them to believe that unfortunate outcomes are more likely to happen to them than they truly are.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that people with depression overestimate the likelihood of negative events happening to them, when the answer key indicates they are actually more accurate due to reduced optimism bias. The student describes a pessimistic bias rather than improved accuracy.

In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You donâ€™t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other peopleâ€™s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

Initially, the pre-conventional stage involves individuals focusing solely on evading punishment and obtaining rewards. Next, the conventional stage involves behavior guided by laws, rules, and consideration for the social needs of others. Finally, the post-conventional stage reflects a more universal and comprehensive grasp of morality, where individuals recognize that certain actions are inherently wrong, regardless of societal norms.

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly describes the pre-conventional level as focusing on avoiding punishment and obtaining rewards, which matches the answer key requirement of obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: Student accurately describes the conventional level as being guided by laws, rules, and consideration for social needs of others, which aligns with the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies the post-conventional level as involving universal and comprehensive morality based on inherent principles, which matches the answer key's description of focus on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model of past events suggests that individuals use cues of causality to make sense of past information. When it comes to hindsight bias, people tend to create explanations for their previous judgments by linking causes, which frequently results in altered memories. After learning the outcome of an event, they instinctively generate reasons for why it happened as it did, which disrupts their capacity to accurately recall their earlier assessments of likelihood.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a causal model involves creating explanations and linking causes to make sense of past events, which aligns with the concept of a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student explains that generating causal explanations after learning outcomes makes events seem more predictable and disrupts accurate recall of prior likelihood assessments, which effectively captures how causal models contribute to hindsight bias by making events seem more inevitable.

Score: 1.0

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Learning plays a role in hindsight bias by making it hard for individuals to recall their previous judgments about the likelihood of events. Once people know the outcome, they find it nearly impossible to ignore this new information and tend to believe that the event's result was more foreseeable than they originally thought or expressed.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that learning makes it difficult to ignore new information when recalling past likelihood judgments, which leads to the hindsight bias effect. The answer captures the core mechanism that newly acquired knowledge interferes with accurate recall of previous beliefs.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing is a decision-making approach where individuals strive to find the very best result. Satisficing, on the other hand, is a decision-making approach where individuals aim for an outcome that is simply good enough. Someone who scores high in the personality trait of neuroticism is more likely to use the maximizing decision style.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:
