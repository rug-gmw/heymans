## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidtâ€™s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

System 1 is responsible for intuitive thinking, which is quick and requires little effort, while System 2 handles rational thinking, characterized by being slow, effortful, deliberate, and reflective. According to Jonathan Haidt's social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, System 1 plays the primary role, suggesting that moral judgments are mainly driven by intuition instead of conscious reasoning.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 thinking refers to intuitive thinking, which aligns with the answer key's requirement for System 1 to be associated with intuitions.
- Correct: The student accurately describes System 2 as handling rational thinking that is deliberate and reflective, which matches the answer key's requirement for System 2 to refer to reasoning or rational thought.
- Correct: The student clearly states that System 1 plays the primary role and that moral judgments are mainly driven by intuition instead of conscious reasoning, demonstrating understanding that System 1 is more dominant than System 2.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

Representative heuristic. The inclination of individuals to determine whether something or someone fits into a specific category based on how closely they resemble typical members of that category.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying concept, though they spell it as 'Representative heuristic' instead of 'representativeness heuristic' - this is a minor spelling variation that doesn't affect the correctness of the identification.
- Correct: The student provides an accurate explanation of the representativeness heuristic, describing it as determining category membership based on resemblance to typical members of that category, which aligns well with the answer key's explanation about estimating likelihood based on similarity to stereotypes.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

The initial information acts as a reference point for forming an impression. The primacy effect means that the first information disproportionately influences the overall impression. Both anchoring and the primacy effect emphasize the significance of early information in shaping impressions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that anchoring involves using initial information as a reference point, which aligns with the concept of taking the first piece of information as the starting point.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as first information disproportionately influencing overall impressions, which captures the essence of better remembering and being influenced by first information.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both concepts emphasize the significance of early/first information in shaping impressions, demonstrating understanding of their common overreliance on initial information.

Score: 1.0

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion involves placing more importance on avoiding losses than on achieving gains, while risk aversion refers to the tendency to steer clear of risky situations.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves placing more importance on avoiding losses than on achieving gains, which accurately captures the concept of weighing losses more heavily than equivalent gains.
- Correct: The student correctly describes risk aversion as the tendency to steer clear of risky situations, which effectively captures the preference for certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 1.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias refers to the tendency of individuals to exaggerate the intensity of their negative emotions following a particular choice. For instance, people might anticipate feeling extremely upset after a breakup, even if they were dissatisfied in the relationship. In reality, they often overpredict their emotional distress, and the breakup might actually improve their well-being.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly identifies that impact bias involves overestimating emotional responses, but their definition is too narrow. They only mention 'negative emotions following a particular choice' when impact bias actually refers to overestimating the impact of future events on our future feelings in general, not just negative emotions or choices.
- Correct: The student correctly explains how impact bias prevents breakups by stating that people 'anticipate feeling extremely upset after a breakup' and 'overpredict their emotional distress,' which aligns with the answer key's point about overestimating how bad a breakup will make them feel.

Score: 0.5

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves anticipating how we will feel emotionally in the future. When considering end-of-life decisions, we tend to experience impact bias, meaning we usually exaggerate the negative emotions we would have if we were sick or elderly. This occurrence is known as the disability paradox.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines affective forecasting as anticipating how we will feel emotionally in the future, which matches the answer key's definition of predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of the core concept that healthy people may incorrectly predict their future preferences when sick, though they frame it through impact bias and the disability paradox rather than the specific example given in the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

According to prospect theory, individuals tend to overvalue low probabilities. Only low probabilities are exaggerated, while extremely low probabilities are underestimated and frequently regarded as impossible.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that low probabilities are overestimated/overvalued according to prospect theory.
- Correct: The student correctly states that extremely low probabilities are regarded as impossible, which aligns with the answer key's point about them being interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion is the tendency to steer clear of losses. It represents a negative value or impact on satisfaction.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes loss aversion as avoiding losses and having negative impact on satisfaction, but fails to capture the key concept that loss aversion means negative utilities are weighted more heavily than positive utilities, or that the value function is steeper for losses than gains.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory considers only the possible financial outcomes and their probabilities. In contrast, expected utility theory accounts for non-financial outcomes (utility) as well. Additionally, expected utility theory incorporates risk aversion, which expected value theory does not.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory deals only with financial outcomes while expected utility theory accounts for non-financial outcomes (utility), which matches the first point in the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly states that expected utility theory incorporates risk aversion while expected value theory does not, which aligns with the second point about expected utility theory considering risk aversion whereas expected value theory does not consider heuristics and biases.

Score: 1.0

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesnâ€™t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

- Expected value theory: a normative framework for decision-making among various alternatives, where each choice has a potential financial result associated with a probability.  
- Expected utility theory: a normative approach to decision-making that considers not only financial outcomes and their probabilities but also incorporates non-financial outcomes (utility) and an individual's risk preferences.  
- Multi-attribute theory: a normative model for selecting among options, where each option is characterized by several attributes, each with its own utility and assigned weight.  
- Prospect theory: a descriptive approach to decision-making that accounts for cognitive biases and heuristic processes influencing choices.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as a normative framework for decision-making with financial outcomes and probabilities, which matches the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes expected utility theory as building on expected value theory but incorporating subjective utility and risk preferences, which aligns with the answer key's description of non-financial, subjective outcomes.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies multi-attribute theory as a normative model with multiple attributes having utilities and weights, though they omitted 'utility' from the name (should be 'multi-attribute utility theory').
- Correct: The student accurately describes prospect theory as a descriptive model that accounts for cognitive biases and heuristics, which matches the answer key's description of a behavioral model considering heuristics and biases.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease peopleâ€™s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Loss aversion causes individuals to become more cautious about taking risks. When faced with potential losses, people tend to act in a risk-averse manner.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student answer incorrectly states that loss aversion makes people more risk-averse and cautious. The correct relationship is the opposite: loss aversion actually decreases risk aversion and can make people risk-seeking when trying to avoid potential losses.

Score: 0.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves acquiring associations by noticing how things vary together. Classical conditioning is the process of learning connections between two events occurring simultaneously in the same place. Operant conditioning involves understanding that specific behaviors result in rewards or punishments.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as learning associations through covariation, using 'acquiring associations by noticing how things vary together' which captures the same core concept.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as learning connections between events that occur simultaneously in the same place, which matches the answer key's concept of associating things that happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as understanding that specific behaviors result in rewards or punishments, which aligns with the answer key's definition of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory correlations involve perceiving relationships between variables that are not actually related, while illusory causation refers to interpreting a real correlation as a cause-and-effect connection when it is not. In illusory correlation, no true correlation is present, whereas in illusory causation, a genuine correlation exists but is mistakenly viewed as causal.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly distinguishes that illusory correlation involves perceiving relationships between variables that don't actually correlate, while illusory causation involves misinterpreting an existing correlation as a causal relationship. The explanation accurately captures both concepts and their key difference.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to â€˜properlyâ€™ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

Knowing how the Dutch healthcare system operates is an example of a schema, which is a collection of general information that guides our expectations in specific circumstances. Proper conduct at a birthday party illustrates a script, which is a type of social schema relating to familiar situations.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the Dutch healthcare system as a schema and provides an accurate explanation that it represents general knowledge and information that guides expectations.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies birthday party behavior as a script and accurately explains that it is a type of social schema for familiar situations, which aligns with the answer key's emphasis on situation-specific behavior.

Score: 1.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

The design stance is an approach created to analyze the mind.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the design stance rather than the physical stance. Additionally, they provide an incomplete and inaccurate explanation that doesn't address why behaviorists would adopt any particular stance or demonstrate understanding of behaviorism's focus on stimulus-response relationships.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

Using the intentional stance, evolutionary psychologists consider why individuals tend to favor those within their own group.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the intentional stance rather than the design stance. Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance because they analyze psychological processes in terms of their evolutionary function and adaptive purpose, not in terms of beliefs and desires (which would be the intentional stance).

Score: 0.0

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

- distinct: A results in B, and B comes after A, with A being the sole cause of B.  
- causality: A leads to B, and this occurs consistently; B always happens after A.  
- plausible: The probability that B follows A is reasonable or likely.  
- contiguous in time and place: A and B occur simultaneously and in the same location.  
- similar in cause and effect: A and B share a comparable relationship between cause and outcome.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies distinctness and explains that A is the sole cause of B, which aligns with the concept that B follows A but not other events.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies consistency (though labeled as 'causality') and accurately explains that B always happens after A.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies plausibility and explains it as the reasonable probability that B follows A, which matches the common sense aspect of plausibility.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies contiguity in time and space and accurately describes that A and B occur simultaneously and in the same location.
- Incorrect: The student misunderstands similarity in cause and effect. They describe it as a 'comparable relationship' rather than the superficial resemblance between A and B themselves.

Score: 0.8

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

The availability heuristic and negativity bias both play a role in this. The availability heuristic suggests that we estimate the likelihood or frequency of events based on how readily examples or related ideas come to mind. Negativity bias means people are more drawn to negative content. Moral outrage attracts significant attention on social media (negative content triggering negativity bias), and social media algorithms amplify this effect. As a result, people encounter moral outrage more frequently, making it more accessible in their memory and thus perceived as more common.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias and explains it as people being 'more drawn to negative content,' which aligns with the answer key's definition of seeking out or placing more weight on negative information.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the availability heuristic as estimating 'likelihood or frequency of events based on how readily examples or related ideas come to mind,' which matches the answer key's definition.
- Correct: The student effectively explains the connection between the two biases, describing how moral outrage attracts attention (negativity bias), becomes more accessible in memory, and is thus perceived as more common (availability heuristic), which demonstrates understanding of their interaction.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

Magical contagion is a superstitionâ€”an imaginary belief that contradicts the established laws of nature and is typically not associated with any religion. It involves the incorrect application of knowledge from various fields. In this belief, people assume that an object can be tainted by someone they dislike, but in reality, a person cannot actually contaminate things. This idea goes against natural laws and misuses biological knowledge in contexts where it doesn't apply.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that magical contagion involves the misapplication of biological concepts (contamination/contagion) to social/psychological situations where they don't apply, which matches the answer key's requirement about incorrectly applying biological domain knowledge to the social domain.

Score: 1.0

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A delusional conspiracy theory is a false belief that is not recognized or accepted by society, whereas a non-delusional conspiracy theory is one that is accepted within a cultural context.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student identifies social acceptance as a distinguishing factor but misses the crucial element of irrationality. The answer key requires both 'irrational belief' AND 'not commonly accepted' for a theory to be delusional, but the student only mentions social acceptance and describes non-delusional theories as simply 'accepted within cultural context' rather than addressing the rationality component.

Score: 0.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

- the inclination to find connections in random events - having a narcissistic attitude - accepting straightforward explanations for complicated issues

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'finding connections in random events' which matches 'seeing patterns in randomness' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'having a narcissistic attitude' which directly corresponds to 'being narcissistic' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'accepting straightforward explanations for complicated issues' which matches 'believing in simple explanations for complex events' from the answer key.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you donâ€™t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Anchoring and adjustment bias occurs when initial information (here, the wrong answers) acts as a reference point. Later information (the correct answer) is used to make changes, but these changes tend to be inadequate. The initial anchor can hinder the ability to learn the right answers since first impressions are frequently influenced more heavily by the original information presented.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes anchoring and adjustment bias, which is a decision-making heuristic about how people make judgments starting from an initial value. However, the answer key specifically requires discussion of memory mechanisms like source amnesia (forgetting the source of information), proactive interference (old information interfering with new), or the continued-influence effect. The student's answer addresses a different psychological concept and doesn't explain the memory-based interference mechanisms that cause incorrect answers to persist and interfere with learning the correct information.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

Simple exposure. Individuals usually favor things they know well, like beliefs they encounter often.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the mere exposure effect (referred to as 'simple exposure'), accurately explaining that people tend to favor familiar things, including beliefs they encounter frequently. This demonstrates understanding of the core psychological mechanism.

Score: 1.0

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Many individuals tend to exhibit a positivity bias, believing they are more likely to encounter positive events and less likely to face negative ones. However, those with major depressive disorder are less influenced by this bias, which leads them to make more accurate predictions rather than less.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people with major depressive disorder are MORE accurate at predictions, not less accurate. They also correctly explain the mechanism - that depressed individuals show reduced positivity bias/optimism compared to non-depressed people, leading to more realistic assessments of negative events.

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

As the reliability of sensory data diminishes, the amount of evidence lessens, leading perception to rely more heavily on prior beliefs.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when sensory information becomes less reliable, prior beliefs have increased influence on perception. The answer demonstrates understanding of the inverse relationship between sensory reliability and prior belief influence in the ideal-observer model.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You donâ€™t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other peopleâ€™s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

- Pre-conventional stage: centered on oneself with minimal mutual exchange, aiming to gain rewards and evade punishments.  
- Conventional stage: acting in ways that are approved by others and conform to laws.  
- Post-conventional stage: understanding that moral beliefs can vary among people, emphasizing universal ethical principles.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the pre-conventional level as focusing on gaining rewards and avoiding punishments, which matches the answer key's emphasis on obeying rules for punishment avoidance or reward gain.
- Correct: The student accurately captures the conventional level by mentioning acting for others' approval and conforming to laws, which aligns with the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the post-conventional level as emphasizing universal ethical principles and recognizing varying moral beliefs, which corresponds to the answer key's focus on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

Your brain instinctively creates logical cause-and-effect stories about events that occurred, rather than those that might have happened but didnâ€™t. This makes it easier to focus on actual outcomes, which leads to hindsight biasâ€”the feeling that you predicted something all along, even if you didnâ€™t.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a causal model involves creating logical cause-and-effect stories about events that occurred, which aligns with the answer key's definition of a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student accurately explains how causal models contribute to hindsight bias by making outcomes seem more predictable than they were, leading to the false feeling of having predicted events 'all along,' which matches the answer key's point about events seeming more inevitable.

Score: 1.0

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

When reflecting on previous probability assessments, it is inevitable to incorporate recently acquired information (curse of knowledge). Events that have already occurred are perceived as more probable, which helps explain the hindsight bias.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that newly learned information inevitably influences past likelihood judgments, mentions the curse of knowledge by name, and explains how this contributes to hindsight bias by making past events seem more probable in retrospect.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing involves aiming to find the optimal option, while satisficing involves settling for an option that is sufficiently good. Individuals who score high in neuroticism tend to prefer the maximizing approach to decision-making.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as aiming to find the optimal option, which aligns with 'trying to make the best choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as settling for an option that is sufficiently good, which matches 'making a good-enough choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that individuals high in neuroticism tend to prefer the maximizing approach, which matches the answer key's statement about neurotic individuals adopting the maximizing decision style.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

I would use nudges, which subtly influence behavior. One example is libertarian paternalism, where institutions guide people toward beneficial actions. This could involve prompting individuals to reflect on what they have learned related to the material, allowing a quick assessment of their engagement. Another approach is assigning small take-home tests that are graded by an AI system, with deadlines and minimum passing scores, but allowing multiple attempts. These methods help motivate continued engagement with the content, and the AI-graded tests serve as a measure of whether people are interacting with the material.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement with the question by proposing concrete, well-reasoned solutions that address the core challenge of promoting student engagement with limited resources. They draw on course concepts (nudges, libertarian paternalism) and suggest practical implementations like AI-graded assessments with multiple attempts and reflection prompts. The answer shows thoughtful consideration of how to balance engagement goals with resource constraints.
