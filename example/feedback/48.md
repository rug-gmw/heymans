## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidtâ€™s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

System 2 thinking is associated with logical moral reasoning, while System 1 thinking relates to intuitive moral reasoning. Among the two, System 2 or rational moral reasoning is more prevalent.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 thinking relates to intuitive moral reasoning, which aligns with the answer key's description of System 1 as intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 2 thinking is associated with logical moral reasoning, which matches the answer key's description of System 2 as reasoning/rational thought.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that System 2 (rational moral reasoning) is more prevalent, when according to Haidt's social-intuitionist model, System 1 (intuition/emotion) is actually more dominant.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

Representativeness heuristic refers to the tendency to classify something into a particular category based on how much it seems to resemble that category. In other words, if X appears to be Y, then it is assumed that X is Y.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process in this scenario.
- Correct: The student provides an accurate explanation of the representativeness heuristic, describing how we classify things based on resemblance to category prototypes, which matches the key concept of estimating likelihood based on similarity to stereotypes.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring involves receiving initial information and using it as a reference point. The primacy effect refers to the tendency to recall the first piece of information encountered or the initial impression made. Both concepts share the characteristic of relying on the earliest information received.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as using initial information as a reference point, which aligns with the answer key's description of taking the first piece of information as the starting point.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as the tendency to recall the first piece of information encountered, which matches the answer key's definition of better remembering the first piece of information.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both concepts share the characteristic of relying on the earliest information received, which corresponds to the answer key's point about overreliance on the first piece of information.

Score: 1.0

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion relates to the importance placed on outcomes, while risk aversion concerns the likelihood of those outcomes.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly describes loss aversion as relating to 'importance placed on outcomes' rather than the specific tendency to weigh losses more heavily than equivalent gains.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly describes risk aversion as concerning 'likelihood of outcomes' rather than the preference for certainty over uncertainty when facing risk.

Score: 0.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the emotional effect that future events will have. This bias can stop people from ending relationships, as they believe that breaking up will significantly harm their mental well-being.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as overestimating the emotional effect of future events, which matches the answer key's definition of overestimating the impact on future feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly explains that impact bias prevents breakups because people believe breaking up will significantly harm their mental well-being, which aligns with overestimating how bad the breakup will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting refers to the attempt to predict one's future emotions. This is especially relevant in end-of-life choices, as people often struggle to accurately anticipate how they will feel later on. As a result, a decision made now about ending life at a specific time may not align with the feelings experienced when that time actually arrives.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines affective forecasting as predictions about future emotions, which aligns with the answer key's definition of 'predictions about our own future emotional state.'
- Correct: The student accurately explains the relevance to end-of-life decisions by noting that current decisions may not align with future feelings, which captures the essence of the answer key's point about healthy people predicting they'd prefer to die when sick but potentially feeling differently when actually sick.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

People tend to overestimate small probabilities. However, there is a distinction between moderately low and extremely low probabilities: for moderately low probabilities, people usually overestimate their likelihood, whereas for extremely low probabilities, they often perceive them as impossible.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that moderately low probabilities are overestimated, which aligns with the answer key's point about merely low probabilities being often overestimated.
- Correct: The student accurately states that extremely low probabilities are often perceived as impossible, which matches the answer key's point about extremely low probabilities being interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Individuals generally feel the pain of losses more strongly than the pleasure of gains, leading them to seek ways to prevent losses. As a result, losses carry a negative value in terms of utility.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that losses are felt more strongly than gains and that losses carry negative utility value, which captures the essence of loss aversion - that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory is a normative framework for making rational decisions based on values. Expected utility theory is similar but goes beyond just values, incorporating other types of utilities, such as those related to money. Additionally, expected utility theory accounts for loss aversion.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that expected utility theory goes beyond values to incorporate 'other types of utilities, such as those related to money.' This reverses the correct relationship - expected value theory deals with financial values while expected utility theory deals with broader non-financial values.
- Incorrect: The student mentions 'loss aversion' rather than 'risk aversion' as specified in the answer key. While related concepts, loss aversion is a specific bias about losses vs gains, whereas risk aversion is the broader concept about uncertainty that expected utility theory addresses.

Score: 0.0

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesnâ€™t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected value theory is a normative model that views decision-making as a rational process based on economic value. Expected utility theory is similar but allows for the use of utilities beyond just values and incorporates loss aversion. Multi-attribute utility theory (MAUT) expands on expected utility theory by enabling individuals to assess and weigh multiple attributes for more practical decision-making. Prospect theory is a descriptive or behavioral model that resembles expected utility theory but accounts for biases and heuristics.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as a normative model and mentions it involves rational decision-making based on economic value, which aligns with the key point about financial outcomes and probabilities.
- Incorrect: While the student correctly identifies expected utility theory as similar to expected value theory and mentions utilities beyond just values, they incorrectly attribute loss aversion to this theory rather than simply explaining that utilities can be subjective rather than just financial.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies MAUT as involving multiple attributes that can be assessed and weighted, which matches the answer key's description of multiple attributes with utilities and weights.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies prospect theory as a descriptive/behavioral model that resembles expected utility theory but accounts for biases and heuristics, which accurately captures the key points.

Score: 0.75

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease peopleâ€™s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Individuals often place greater importance on losses than on gains, which leads them to steer clear of situations where they might lose something.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly identifies that people place greater importance on losses than gains, but incorrectly concludes that this makes people more risk-averse by avoiding potential losses. The answer key indicates that loss aversion actually decreases risk aversion because people become willing to accept risks to avoid certain losses, potentially making them risk-seeking in loss domains.

Score: 0.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning is a method of learning. Classical conditioning involves learning when events occur simultaneously or in close sequence (as demonstrated by Pavlov's dog). Operant conditioning involves learning through rewards and consequences.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as a method of learning, which aligns with the answer key's definition of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as learning when events occur simultaneously or in close sequence, which matches the answer key's description of learning to associate things that happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning through rewards and consequences, which corresponds to the answer key's definition of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation occurs when a person believes that one or more variables cause each other, even though this is not true. Illusory correlation happens when a person assumes there is a relationship between two or more variables when no actual correlation exists.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly distinguishes between illusory causation (incorrectly believing variables cause each other when they don't) and illusory correlation (perceiving a relationship/correlation that doesn't actually exist). This captures the essential difference outlined in the answer key.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to â€˜properlyâ€™ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

Knowing how the Dutch healthcare system operates is a schema, as it represents a general concept of the process. In contrast, the appropriate conduct at a birthday party is a script, since it is a particular type of behavioral schema.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that understanding the Dutch healthcare system is a schema and provides an appropriate explanation that it represents a general concept/process, which aligns with the answer key's explanation about knowledge and relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script and accurately describes it as a particular type of behavioral schema, which corresponds to the answer key's explanation about social schemas describing behavior in specific situations.

Score: 1.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

Physicality level of analysis. Behaviorists concentrate on how stimuli provoke behavior. They believe behavior is best understood by examining its physical effects, therefore using the physicality level of analysis.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that behaviorists adopted the physical stance (referred to as 'physicality level of analysis') and provides the correct reasoning that they focused on how stimuli cause behavior through physical processes. The terminology is slightly different but the core understanding is accurate.

Score: 1.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

Evolutionary psychologists focus on the functional level of analysis, as it primarily involves examining the purpose and usefulness of psychological processes.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance (referred to as 'functional level of analysis') and provides the correct reasoning that this involves examining the purpose and usefulness of psychological processes, which aligns with the design stance's focus on function.

Score: 1.0

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Specificity: Your cat purrs as a result of being scratched, not from being kicked. Plausibility: It makes sense that your cat purrs when scratched because it enjoys the sensation. Consistency: Your cat consistently purrs whenever you scratch it. Time and place: When you scratch your cat, it will purr, unlike the neighboring cat. Cause and effect similarity: Moving your leg toward the ball causes the ball to roll.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies specificity/distinctness and provides an appropriate example showing that purring follows scratching but not other events like kicking.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies plausibility and provides a reasonable example explaining why scratching would logically cause purring.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies consistency and demonstrates understanding that the same cause (scratching) always produces the same effect (purring).
- Incorrect: While the student mentions 'time and place,' their example about the neighboring cat doesn't properly illustrate contiguity in time and space - it seems to confuse this with specificity.
- Incorrect: The student attempts to address similarity between cause and effect but the example of leg movement and ball rolling doesn't demonstrate superficial resemblance between cause and effect.

Score: 0.6

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Availability heuristic refers to the tendency of individuals to judge something as more likely if it is readily recalled. Negativity bias means people are more inclined to notice and remember negative social media content over positive content. These biases combine so that people focus on negative posts more frequently, making them more memorable. As a result, this leads to an exaggerated perception of the number of morally outraged individuals on social media.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias as people being more inclined to notice and remember negative content, which aligns with the answer key's definition of seeking out or placing more weight on negative information like morally outraged content.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the availability heuristic as judging something as more likely if it is readily recalled, which matches the answer key's definition of estimating frequency based on ease of recall.
- Correct: The student successfully explains how the two biases work together - negativity bias makes negative posts more noticeable and memorable, which through availability heuristic leads to overestimating moral outrage, matching the answer key's explanation of their interaction.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

Framework theories are general, widely accepted understandings of how the world works. Since you view magical contagion as one of these common beliefs, you tend to avoid using items that belonged to someone you strongly dislike.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes what framework theories are but fails to explain magical contagion in terms of domain-specific knowledge transfer. The answer does not identify that biological contagion concepts are being incorrectly applied to social/psychological domains, which is the key insight required.

Score: 0.0

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A conspiracy theory that is delusional is generally not accepted by many people, whereas one that is non-delusional tends to be widely accepted.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student only addresses the 'commonly accepted' criterion but misses the key distinction about 'irrational belief.' The answer key requires both conditions: a delusional conspiracy theory must be both irrational AND not commonly accepted. The student's answer suggests acceptance alone determines the distinction, which is incomplete.

Score: 0.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

Reduced intelligence, high neuroticism, and low trust.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identified 'reduced intelligence' which matches 'having a low level of intelligence' from the answer key.
- Incorrect: High neuroticism is not listed among the cognitive and personality factors in the answer key for conspiratorial thinking.
- Incorrect: Low trust is not mentioned in the answer key as one of the factors contributing to conspiratorial thinking that were covered in the lecture.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you donâ€™t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Instrumental learning

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student answer 'Instrumental learning' does not address the correct psychological mechanisms. The answer key requires explanation of source amnesia (forgetting that an incorrect answer was wrong), proactive interference (initial incorrect answers interfering with correct ones), or the continued-influence effect. Instrumental learning refers to learning through consequences/reinforcement, which is not relevant to how incorrect answers can interfere with remembering correct information.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

The tendency to develop a preference for things simply because they are familiar.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the mere exposure effect, which is the psychological mechanism where repeated exposure to stimuli increases preference for them due to familiarity. This directly answers the question about how politicians use repetition to make their messages more attractive.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Certainly.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student provided no substantive answer to the question about whether major depressive disorder affects accuracy in predicting negative events. The response 'Certainly' does not address the key point that people with depression are more accurate due to reduced optimism bias.

Score: 0.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

As a result, prior beliefs take precedence while sensory information becomes less influential, leading to no change in your prior belief.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly identifies that prior beliefs become more influential when sensory reliability decreases, but incorrectly states this leads to 'no change in your prior belief.' In the ideal observer model, prior beliefs and sensory evidence are combined to form perception - decreased sensory reliability makes perception more influenced by priors, but doesn't eliminate the integration process entirely.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You donâ€™t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other peopleâ€™s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

Pre-conventional level: If you avoid doing something, then others should avoid it too. Conventional level: You aim to follow the law and show respect for authority.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The description 'If you avoid doing something, then others should avoid it too' does not capture the pre-conventional level's focus on avoiding punishment or gaining rewards. This sounds more like a reciprocity principle rather than self-interest motivation.
- Correct: The description correctly identifies the conventional level's focus on following laws and respecting authority, which aligns with the focus on social norms and rules.
- Incorrect: The student did not provide any description of the post-conventional level, which should focus on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model of past events is a story someone creates explaining the sequence in which events occurred. This leads to hindsight bias because people often overlook the fact that the chance of these events occurring in that specific order is very low, yet they believe it was simple to foresee the entire sequence.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies a causal model as a story or narrative explaining how past events occurred in sequence, which aligns with the answer key's definition of a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student explains that causal models contribute to hindsight bias by making people believe the sequence was 'simple to foresee,' which captures the essence of events seeming more inevitable than they actually were.

Score: 1.0

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Hindsight bias occurs when we overlook the learning process and believe we could have predicted an event after it has already occurred. This is a cognitive error because we fail to recognize that we gained new information only after the event took place.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that hindsight bias involves incorporating newly learned information when estimating past judgments, explaining that we fail to recognize we gained new information only after the event occurred. This captures the core mechanism described in the answer key about being unable to avoid taking newly learned information into account when estimating past likelihood judgments.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing refers to the inclination to choose the optimal option, while satisficing means settling for a decision that is sufficiently satisfactory. Individuals with high levels of neuroticism are more likely to use the maximizing approach when making decisions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as choosing the optimal option, which aligns with 'trying to make the best choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as settling for a sufficiently satisfactory decision, which matches 'making a good-enough choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that individuals with high neuroticism are more likely to use the maximizing approach, which matches the answer key.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

I would opt for a group project similar to the one we completed in this course, where students create a professional deliverable applying the course theories, and other groups assess it using a detailed evaluation form. The instructor would then quickly review all submissions or use AI to identify assignments that are either inadequate or have questionable grades. This project would account for 20-30% of the overall grade, with a multiple-choice test administered for the final exam.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement by proposing a specific, well-structured approach that addresses the core challenge. They suggest a peer-reviewed group project with detailed evaluation forms, instructor oversight with AI assistance for efficiency, appropriate grade weighting, and complementary assessment methods. The answer shows thoughtful consideration of both student engagement and resource constraints.
