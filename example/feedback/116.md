## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

In the social-intuitionist model, System 1 is the primary driver, as our moral judgments largely stem from intuition influenced by emotions. System 2 involves conscious, deliberate thinking and is typically used to justify the intuitive moral decisions produced by System 1. Thus, System 1 holds the dominant position in this model.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 involves intuition and is influenced by emotions, which aligns with the answer key's definition of System 1 as intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student accurately describes System 2 as involving 'conscious, deliberate thinking' which corresponds to the answer key's definition of reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student clearly states that 'System 1 holds the dominant position in this model' and explains that System 1 is 'the primary driver,' which directly matches the answer key's requirement that System 1 is more dominant.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

The core heuristic involved is the representativeness heuristic, where we assess whether something or someone belongs to a category by how closely they resemble the typical example of that category.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process in this scenario.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that the representativeness heuristic involves assessing category membership based on resemblance to typical examples, which matches the answer key's explanation about estimating likelihood based on stereotype similarity.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring refers to the impact that the initial piece of information we receive has on our later judgment. This initial information acts as a reference point, causing subsequent information to be influenced disproportionately when forming a final judgment. The primacy effect describes how the first traits we learn about someone disproportionately shape our overall impression of that person, often leading us to interpret later traits in a way that aligns with the initial ones. Both concepts highlight the unequal influence that first-received information has on later evaluations.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as the impact of initial information on later judgment and describes it as a reference point that disproportionately influences subsequent evaluations, which aligns with the answer key's definition of taking the first piece of information as the starting point.
- Incorrect: The student describes the primacy effect in terms of impression formation and trait interpretation, but misses the key aspect from the answer key that it's specifically about better remembering the first piece of information.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both concepts involve the unequal or disproportionate influence of first-received information on later evaluations, which matches the answer key's point about overreliance on the first piece of information.

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency to place greater emphasis on losses than on equivalent gains. In contrast, risk aversion means having a basic preference for certainty rather than uncertainty.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves placing greater emphasis on losses than equivalent gains, which matches the answer key's definition.
- Correct: The student accurately defines risk aversion as having a preference for certainty rather than uncertainty, which aligns with the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias refers to the tendency to exaggerate how long and how strongly we will experience emotions tied to a future choice. This can make it harder to end a relationship because we overpredict the length and severity of the negative feelings involved.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies impact bias as overestimating future emotional experiences, which aligns with the answer key's definition of overestimating the impact of future events on feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly explains that impact bias prevents breakups by overpredicting negative feelings, which matches the answer key's point about overestimating how bad a breakup would feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves anticipating how strongly we will feel positive or negative emotions in the future. We often overestimate both the intensity and length of these feelings, a tendency known as impact bias. This happens because we overlook how quickly emotions fade (emotional evanescence) and focus too much on the future event itself, ignoring other factors that will affect our emotions (focalism). When it comes to end-of-life decisions, the issue is that we tend to predict feeling worse than we actually do, which can lead us to disagree with prior choices since people often feel better than expected in those situations, a phenomenon called the disability paradox.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies affective forecasting as predictions about future emotional states, though they provide more detail about biases and mechanisms than required by the answer key.
- Correct: The student captures the key concept that healthy people may make different end-of-life preferences than when actually facing illness, explaining this through the disability paradox where people feel better than expected in difficult situations.

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

People tend to overvalue small probabilities, but when probabilities are extremely low, they are frequently perceived as impossible.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people overvalue (overestimate) small probabilities, which aligns with the answer key's point about merely low probabilities being overestimated.
- Correct: The student accurately states that extremely low probabilities are perceived as impossible, which directly matches the answer key's second point about extremely low probabilities being interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over acquiring equivalent gains. It represents a negative experience for individuals and corresponds to negative utility in prospect theory. In this theory, the utility function decreases more steeply for losses than it rises for gains of the same size.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion means the utility function decreases more steeply for losses than it rises for gains of the same size, which directly matches the answer key's requirement that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities and that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.

Score: 1.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory focuses solely on monetary outcomes, whereas expected utility theory takes into account the personal importance or subjective value of outcomes, which may not be monetary. Additionally, expected utility theory incorporates the concept of risk aversion.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory focuses on monetary outcomes while expected utility theory considers subjective/personal value of outcomes beyond just financial measures.
- Correct: The student correctly mentions that expected utility theory incorporates risk aversion, which aligns with the answer key's point about considering risk aversion versus not considering heuristics and biases.

Score: 1.0

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

The first is expected value theory, which involves multiple options with associated financial outcomes and probabilities. The second is expected utility theory, which resembles expected value theory but incorporates subjective values like desirability, taking into account both probabilities and utilities. The third model is multi-attribute theory, where options have several attributes, each assigned a weight and utility. The final model is prospect theory, which is similar to expected utility theory but also takes into account biases and heuristics.

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies expected value theory and explains it involves multiple options with financial outcomes and probabilities, matching the key concept.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies expected utility theory and explains it's like expected value theory but incorporates subjective values/utilities rather than just financial outcomes.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies multi-attribute theory (though missing 'utility' in the name) and accurately explains it involves options with multiple attributes, each having weight and utility.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies prospect theory and explains it's similar to expected utility theory but incorporates biases and heuristics, though they don't mention it's a descriptive/behavioral model.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Because we are inherently averse to losses, we tend to avoid risking them. For instance, when faced with a gamble that has a 50 percent chance to win and a 50 percent chance to lose an equivalent amount, we are reluctant to take the risk since the potential loss feels more significant (and negative) than the equivalent gain.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes how loss aversion increases risk aversion (avoiding gambles to prevent losses), but the answer key requires explaining that loss aversion can actually decrease risk aversion when people face potential losses, making them willing to accept risk to avoid those losses.

Score: 0.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves learning to connect two stimuli. Classical conditioning refers to learning the link between an unconditioned stimulus and a conditioned stimulus that occur together. Operant conditioning involves learning about the rewards or punishments that follow a particular action or behavior.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as learning connections/associations between stimuli, which aligns with the key concept of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as learning links between stimuli that occur together, which matches the answer key's description of associating things that happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning about rewards or punishments following actions/behaviors, which directly corresponds to the answer key's definition.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation occurs when we mistakenly believe one thing causes another, while illusory correlation happens when we incorrectly assume that two things are related or change together.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly distinguishes between illusory causation (mistakenly believing one thing causes another) and illusory correlation (incorrectly assuming two things are related). This captures the essential difference that illusory causation involves misinterpreting correlation as causation, while illusory correlation involves perceiving a relationship that doesn't actually exist.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

A healthcare system is an example of a schema, while appropriate behavior at a birthday party is an example of a script. A script is a type of social schema related to typical scenarios, like a birthday party, which directs our actions and often the sequence in which events occur. A schema is essentially a connected set of knowledge about a particular subject, such as the Dutch healthcare system, that when triggered, offers related information and aids in understanding how that system operates.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that understanding the Dutch healthcare system is a schema and provides an accurate explanation that it represents 'a connected set of knowledge about a particular subject' that 'aids in understanding how that system operates.'
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that behavior at a birthday party is a script and provides a good explanation that it is 'a type of social schema related to typical scenarios' that 'directs our actions and often the sequence in which events occur.'

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

This approach is purely mechanical, concentrating only on the physical forces that trigger an action, explaining how a stimulus (the force) produces a behavior, without considering its purpose or intent.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that behaviorists adopted the physical stance by describing their approach as 'purely mechanical' and focusing on 'physical forces that trigger an action' and how 'a stimulus produces a behavior.' This accurately captures the behaviorist emphasis on stimulus-response mechanisms rather than mental states or purposes.

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

Evolutionary psychologists take a functional approach, examining psychological behaviors based on the roles they play in the survival and well-being of organisms.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that evolutionary psychologists take a functional approach, which aligns with the design stance. While they don't explicitly use Dennett's terminology of 'design stance,' they accurately describe the core principle that evolutionary psychologists analyze psychological processes in terms of their function and adaptive purpose.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

The first is consistency, meaning event A always happens alongside event B. The second is distinctiveness, where A and B occur together, but B does not happen without A. The third is plausibility, indicating there is a reasonable explanation for their co-occurrence. Another is time and space contiguity, meaning A and B happen near each other in both time and location. The final heuristic is similarity in cause and effect, where A and B are physically similar in that A leads to B.

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies consistency and provides an accurate explanation that A always happens alongside B, which matches the answer key's definition.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies distinctiveness and explains it as A and B occurring together but B not happening without A, which captures the essence of specificity from the answer key.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies plausibility and explains it as having a reasonable explanation for co-occurrence, which aligns with the answer key's common sense explanation.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies contiguity in time and space and accurately explains it as A and B happening near each other in both time and location.
- Incorrect: Student mentions similarity in cause and effect but provides an unclear explanation saying 'A and B are physically similar in that A leads to B' which doesn't capture the answer key's concept of superficial resemblance between cause and effect.

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

One factor is the negativity bias, where we are more drawn to negative emotional content compared to positive, exciting content. This interacts with the availability heuristic, which means we judge the frequency of an event based on how easily or how many examples we can remember. As a result, by focusing more on negative, morally upsetting content, we tend to recall such instances more readily and therefore overestimate how many people are actually morally outraged.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias and explains it as being more drawn to negative emotional content, which aligns with the answer key's description of seeking out or placing more weight on negative information like morally outraged content.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the availability heuristic as judging frequency based on how easily examples can be remembered, which matches the answer key's definition of estimating frequency based on ease of recall.
- Correct: The student effectively explains the interaction between the two biases, showing how negativity bias leads to focusing on negative content, which then makes such examples more readily recalled through the availability heuristic, resulting in overestimation of moral outrage frequency.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

This can be understood as an overextension of knowledge from one area to another. In this case, the idea from biology—that bacteria or viruses can be spread through spaces—carries over into the psychological realm, leading us to believe that the negative feelings or dislike we have toward a person also transfer onto their possessions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that biological contagion concepts (bacteria/viruses spreading) are being inappropriately applied to the psychological/social domain (negative feelings transferring to possessions), demonstrating understanding of framework theory domain confusion.

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A delusional conspiracy theory involves a personal belief that is considered irrational or socially unacceptable depending on cultural context. In contrast, a non-delusional conspiracy is viewed as reasonable. Both provide an explanation for events based on the actions of powerful groups.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that delusional conspiracy theories involve irrational beliefs and social unacceptability (which aligns with 'not commonly accepted'), while non-delusional ones are viewed as reasonable. This captures the key distinction between irrational/uncommon versus rational/acceptable beliefs.

Score: 1.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

One personality trait involves favoring simple explanations rather than more detailed and complicated ones. A cognitive aspect is that conspiratorial thinking can provide individuals with a sense of control by making the complex world seem more understandable. Another cognitive element is the availability heuristic, where increased exposure to conspiracy theories makes people more inclined to believe they are true.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'favoring simple explanations rather than more detailed and complicated ones' which matches the answer key point about 'believing in simple explanations for complex events'.
- Incorrect: While the student mentions conspiracy theories providing 'a sense of control' and making the world 'more understandable', this does not directly match any of the specific cognitive factors listed in the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student discusses the availability heuristic and exposure effects, but this concept is not among the specific cognitive and personality factors listed in the answer key.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Hindsight bias leads us to believe that we always knew the outcome. This can hinder learning because it creates a false sense of mastery over the material, reducing our motivation to continue studying.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies hindsight bias as the mechanism. Hindsight bias involves believing you knew something all along after learning the outcome, but the question asks specifically about how incorrect answers during self-quizzing interfere with learning. The answer key requires identifying source amnesia (forgetting that your answer was incorrect) or proactive interference (initial incorrect answers interfering with correct ones), not hindsight bias about perceived mastery.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

The psychological process involved is the mere exposure effect, where repeated exposure to a message leads us to develop a greater preference for it due to growing familiarity.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the mere exposure effect and accurately explains that repeated exposure leads to increased preference through familiarity, which directly matches the answer key's definition of mere exposure as the tendency to prefer familiar things.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Major depressive disorder does not impair people's ability to make accurate predictions; rather, individuals with the disorder are less influenced by the positivity bias that causes others to mistakenly think negative events are unlikely to occur to them.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people with major depressive disorder are more accurate at predictions because they are less affected by optimism bias (referred to as 'positivity bias'), which aligns with the answer key's point about reduced overly optimistic tendencies making depressed individuals more accurate.

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

As the trustworthiness of sensory data diminishes, prior beliefs have a greater impact on our final judgment (perception), causing the resulting belief to align more closely with prior beliefs than with the sensory input.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when sensory information becomes less reliable, prior beliefs have greater influence on perception, and that the final perception shifts more toward prior expectations rather than sensory input. This demonstrates understanding of the key concept from the ideal-observer model.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

The initial level is the preconventional stage, where morality is guided by rewards and punishments with minimal consideration of reciprocity. The next level is the conventional stage, where morality centers on caring for others and following established rules. The final level is the postconventional stage, where individuals can contemplate moral dilemmas and consider broader ethical principles.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the preconventional level and accurately describes it as being guided by rewards and punishments, which matches the answer key's description of obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the conventional level and accurately describes it as centering on caring for others and following established rules, which aligns with the answer key's description of focusing on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the postconventional level and accurately describes it as considering broader ethical principles and contemplating moral dilemmas, which matches the answer key's description of focusing on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

The causal model explains that once we learn the result of an event, we construct a causal narrative to explain how that result occurred. This process leads to hindsight bias, making the outcome appear more predictable and unavoidable than it did initially.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a causal model is a narrative that explains how events are related, specifically mentioning it as a 'causal narrative to explain how that result occurred.'
- Correct: The student accurately explains the connection to hindsight bias, stating that the causal model makes outcomes 'appear more predictable and unavoidable than it did initially,' which aligns with the key point about events seeming more inevitable.

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

The curse of knowledge effect refers to our inability to ignore information we have already acquired. It plays a role in hindsight bias because even when we attempt to exclude what we know or pretend we don’t have that knowledge, it still impacts our evaluation or judgment of a situation.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the curse of knowledge as the inability to ignore acquired information and accurately explains how this contributes to hindsight bias by affecting our judgments even when we try to exclude that knowledge. This captures the core concept that newly learned information cannot be avoided when estimating past likelihood judgments.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

The maximizing decision style involves striving to choose the best possible outcome from multiple options. In contrast, the satisficing decision style focuses on selecting an option that is good enough, even if it isn't the optimal one. Individuals with high levels of neuroticism are more likely to use a maximizing decision approach.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as striving to choose the best possible outcome, which aligns with the answer key's 'trying to make the best choice.'
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as selecting an option that is 'good enough' even if not optimal, which matches the answer key's 'making a good-enough choice.'
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that individuals with high neuroticism are more likely to use a maximizing decision approach, which matches the answer key.

Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

We could apply a nudge strategy, which gently influences behavior without limiting a person's freedom to choose. Using nudges helps prevent resistance from students that might arise if we directly tell them what to do and expect. There are various types of nudges, and employing multiple ones may improve effectiveness. For instance, we could make learning resources easier to access, increase the visibility of individual performance to create social motivation, and establish high standards that serve as anchors, encouraging people to meet or exceed them rather than settling for lower expectations.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement with the question by providing a thoughtful, coherent strategy using nudge theory. They explain the concept of nudges, justify why this approach is suitable for the given constraints (avoiding resistance while encouraging engagement), and provide specific, practical examples including accessibility improvements, social motivation through visibility, and anchor effects with high standards. The answer shows good understanding of behavioral concepts and their application to educational settings.
