Grade: 8.0

## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidtâ€™s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

As the name implies, Haidt's social-intuitionist model is primarily based on intuition. System 1, which represents intuitive thought, plays the leading role. Although rational thought, or System 2 thinking, is included in the model, it only comes into play in specific situations.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 represents intuitive thought, which aligns with the answer key's requirement that System 1 refers to intuitions.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies System 2 as rational thought, which matches the answer key's requirement that System 2 refers to reasoning or rational thought.
- Correct: The student clearly states that System 1 'plays the leading role' and that System 2 'only comes into play in specific situations,' demonstrating understanding that System 1 (intuition) is more dominant than System 2 (reasoning).

Score: 1.0

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

This is connected to the representativeness heuristic, which refers to the tendency to judge the likelihood of an event or object belonging to a specific category based on how closely it resembles typical members of that category.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying concept.
- Correct: The student provides an accurate explanation of the representativeness heuristic, describing how we judge likelihood of category membership based on resemblance to typical members of that category.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring refers to the idea that initial information serves as a reference point against which all subsequent information is evaluated. The primacy effect refers to the tendency to remember the first information presented more strongly than later information. Thus, anchoring can contribute to the primacy effect.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes anchoring as initial information serving as a reference point, which captures the essence of taking the first piece of information as the starting point.
- Correct: The student accurately defines the primacy effect as the tendency to remember first information more strongly than later information, which aligns with better remembering the first piece of information.
- Incorrect: While the student mentions that anchoring can contribute to the primacy effect, they don't clearly identify the common element of both phenomena being an overreliance on first information.

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Risk aversion arises because individuals prefer certainty over uncertainty, making them cautious in uncertain situations. Loss aversion refers to people's tendency to avoid losses since they find them unpleasant, which can sometimes lead to more risky actions depending on how the situation is presented.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion refers to people's tendency to avoid losses because they find them unpleasant, which captures the essence that losses are weighted more heavily than gains.
- Correct: The student accurately describes risk aversion as individuals preferring certainty over uncertainty, which directly matches the answer key definition.

Score: 1.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias refers to the tendency to exaggerate how much a decision will affect our future emotions. This often causes individuals to avoid ending relationships because they anticipate the breakup will feel worse than remaining in an unhappy partnership, even though this may not actually be true.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as the tendency to exaggerate how much a decision will affect future emotions, which aligns with the answer key's definition of overestimating the impact of future events on future feelings.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that impact bias prevents breakups because people anticipate the breakup will feel worse than staying in an unhappy relationship, which matches the answer key's point about overestimating how bad a breakup will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting refers to the tendency to make choices about the future based on anticipated emotions related to those choices. This concept is significant because of the disability paradox, which reveals that healthy individuals often believe they would prefer to end their lives if disabled or ill, yet when faced with such circumstances, they tend to desire to live as long as possible. This contradiction adds complexity to decisions about end-of-life care.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies affective forecasting as predictions about future emotional states, though they phrase it as 'anticipated emotions related to choices' which captures the same concept.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the key phenomenon using the 'disability paradox' - that healthy people predict they'd prefer to die when sick/disabled, but when actually in those situations, they prefer to live, which directly matches the answer key's second point.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

People often undervalue small probabilities. There is a distinction between low probabilities, which are underestimated, and extremely low probabilities, which are typically considered impossible.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student states that low probabilities are underestimated, but according to prospect theory and the answer key, merely low probabilities are often overestimated, not underestimated.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that extremely low probabilities are typically considered impossible, which aligns with the answer key point that they are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 0.5

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

When faced with two options framed as negative outcomes, loss aversion leads to selecting the option that results in the smaller loss.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes a behavioral consequence of loss aversion rather than explaining what loss aversion reflects in terms of utility. The answer key requires explaining that loss aversion means negative utilities are weighted more heavily than positive utilities, or that the value function is steeper for losses than gains. The student's answer focuses on decision-making behavior between losses rather than the underlying utility representation.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

The key distinctions between these theories lie in what the expected utility theory additionally considers. It includes outcomes beyond just monetary gains and acknowledges that individuals tend to avoid risk.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected utility theory considers outcomes beyond monetary gains, which aligns with the answer key point about expected utility dealing with non-financial values while expected value theory deals only with financial values.
- Correct: The student correctly mentions that expected utility theory acknowledges risk aversion, which corresponds to the answer key point about expected utility theory considering risk aversion while expected value theory does not consider heuristics and biases.

Score: 1.0

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesnâ€™t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

The four models with a brief explanation are: Expected value theory, which proposes that people make decisions based on outcomes assessed by monetary gains. Expected utility theory is similar but also factors in non-monetary elements such as personal preferences and risk aversion. Multi-attribute theory evaluates an outcome by combining multiple attributes, each assigned a specific value and importance. Prospect theory builds on expected utility theory by incorporating heuristics and biases, making it descriptive, while the other three are normative.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as being based on monetary gains/outcomes, which aligns with the answer key's description of financial outcomes with probabilities.
- Correct: The student accurately describes expected utility theory as similar to expected value theory but including non-monetary elements like personal preferences, which matches the answer key's description of subjective utility beyond financial outcomes.
- Correct: The student correctly explains multi-attribute utility theory as evaluating outcomes by combining multiple attributes with assigned values and importance, which corresponds to the answer key's description of multiple attributes with utilities and weights.
- Correct: The student accurately describes prospect theory as building on expected utility theory while incorporating heuristics and biases, and correctly identifies it as descriptive versus the others being normative, matching the answer key perfectly.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease peopleâ€™s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to people's tendency to steer clear of losses because they find them unpleasant. As a result, the way a decision is presented influences how people act. When a choice is framed in terms of a possible loss, individuals are more likely to take risks in an effort to prevent that loss.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion leads people to take risks when trying to avoid losses, which decreases risk aversion and can make people risk-seeking in loss domains.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning is a method of learning by associating events. Classical conditioning involves learning when two events occur closely together. Operant conditioning involves learning through the use of rewards and consequences.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as learning through associations, which aligns with the answer key's definition of 'learning associations through covariation.'
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as learning when two events occur closely together, which matches the answer key's explanation of learning associations when things happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning through rewards and consequences, which corresponds to the answer key's description of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation refers to the tendency for people to wrongly believe that a causal connection exists simply because two events occur together. Illusory correlation is the inclination to perceive a relationship between two variables even when no actual association exists.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly distinguishes both concepts: illusory causation as wrongly inferring causation from co-occurrence (which aligns with misinterpreting correlation as causation), and illusory correlation as perceiving relationships where none exist. The explanations capture the essential difference between the two phenomena.

Score: 1.0

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to â€˜properlyâ€™ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

The Dutch healthcare system can be seen as a schema, while the actions at a birthday party represent a script. This is because a schema refers to a particular area governed by certain rules, whereas a script is a more detailed social and cultural version of a schema.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, though their explanation about 'an area governed by rules' is less precise than the answer key's explanation about knowledge and relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that birthday party behavior represents a script and provides a reasonable explanation that scripts are 'detailed social and cultural versions of schemas,' which aligns with the answer key's concept of scripts as social schemas for specific situations.

Score: 1.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

Behaviorists took a broad approach, explaining behavior based on observable actions rather than intentions, since they believed the mind was not measurable.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes behaviorism correctly but fails to identify which of Dennett's stances behaviorists adopted. The answer key requires identifying the physical stance and explaining that behaviorists focused on stimulus-response processes, but the student doesn't mention Dennett's stances at all.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

Evolutionary psychologists take a functional approach, explaining psychological behaviors in terms of their purpose.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly identifies that evolutionary psychologists take a functional approach and explain behaviors in terms of purpose, but fails to specifically mention Dennett's 'design stance' which was explicitly asked for in the question.

Score: 0.0

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

The five heuristics are: Distinctiveness, where B occurs when A happens, but B does not occur when C happens; Consistency, meaning B always follows whenever A occurs; Plausibility, indicating that based on existing knowledge, it is reasonable to believe A causes B; Contingency in time and space, where B happens soon after A; and Similarity in cause and effect, where A occurs in a particular manner and B follows in that same specific way.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies distinctiveness and explains it as B occurring when A happens but not when other events (C) happen, which matches the answer key's concept of specificity.
- Correct: The student accurately describes consistency as B always following whenever A occurs, which directly matches the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly explains plausibility as being based on existing knowledge that makes it reasonable to believe A causes B, which aligns with the answer key's 'common sense' explanation.
- Incorrect: The student says 'contingency' instead of 'contiguity' and only mentions temporal proximity ('soon after'), missing the spatial component that both A and B should occur in the same location.
- Incorrect: The student's explanation of similarity is unclear and doesn't match the answer key. They describe A and B following 'in the same specific way' rather than A and B superficially resembling each other.

Score: 0.6

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

The first bias, known as availability bias, refers to how we judge the likelihood of an event based on how quickly it is recalled. The second bias involved is negativity bias, which means we are more drawn to negative material, such as morally outraged content. Because we focus more on negative content, it becomes more prominent in our memory, leading us to overestimate how common morally outraged individuals are.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly identifies negativity bias and explains it accurately as being more drawn to negative material like morally outraged content, but the answer key specifically defines it as seeking out or placing more weight on negative information.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies availability bias (equivalent to availability heuristic) and accurately explains it as judging likelihood based on how quickly something is recalled, which matches the answer key's definition of estimating frequency based on ease of recall.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of how the two biases work together - focusing on negative content makes it more prominent in memory, leading to overestimation of moral outrage frequency, which aligns with the answer key's explanation of the causal relationship.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

Magical contagion is a type of superstition that occurs when concepts from one theoretical framework are applied to another. Specifically, the notion of contagion from biology is adapted and used within the context of psychology.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that magical contagion involves the misapplication of biological contagion concepts to the psychological/social domain, demonstrating understanding of how framework theories from different domains can be incorrectly transferred.

Score: 1.0

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A conspiracy theory that is delusional is not accepted by society, whereas one that is not delusional is accepted.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student only identifies social acceptance as the distinguishing factor but omits the crucial element of irrationality. According to the answer key, a delusional conspiracy theory requires both irrational belief AND lack of common acceptance, not just social rejection alone.

Score: 0.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

Being male Having less intelligence or analytical ability Belonging to a minority group

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'being male' as a factor, which matches 'being a man' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student mentions 'having less intelligence or analytical ability' which corresponds to both 'having a low level of intelligence' and 'having a low level of analytical thinking' from the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student mentions 'belonging to a minority group' which is not listed among the cognitive and personality factors in the answer key.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you donâ€™t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

This relates to the concept that individuals often recall information but fail to remember whether that information was accurate or not.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the core mechanism of source amnesia - recalling information while forgetting its accuracy status, which directly matches the answer key's explanation of forgetting that a provided answer was incorrect and mistaking it for correct.

Score: 1.0

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

By stating it repeatedly, they may aim for people to accept their claim as true simply because of its frequent repetition. This relates to the concept of mere exposure.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies mere exposure as the psychological mechanism and demonstrates understanding that repeated exposure leads to increased preference/acceptance. The explanation accurately captures how politicians use repetition to make messages more attractive through familiarity.

Score: 1.0

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

This reduces their accuracy in making these predictions. This happens because availability bias plays a significant role in the process. Individuals with MDD tend to recall negative emotions more readily, leading them to assume they will experience these feelings in the future as well.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that major depressive disorder reduces accuracy in predictions, when the answer key indicates that people with MDD are actually more accurate due to reduced optimism bias. The student's explanation about availability bias and negative emotion recall, while potentially relevant to depression, does not address the core finding about improved predictive accuracy.

Score: 0.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

The impact of the initial belief grows more significant.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that prior beliefs (initial beliefs) become more significant when sensory information is less reliable, which matches the core concept from the answer key.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You donâ€™t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other peopleâ€™s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

Kohlberg outlines three stages: the pre-conventional level, where morality is centered on oneself; the conventional level, where morality is influenced by others' opinions; and the post-conventional level, where morality goes beyond the individual and considers broader universal principles.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes pre-conventional level as 'centered on oneself' which is too vague and doesn't capture the key aspect of obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student correctly describes conventional level as being 'influenced by others' opinions' which aligns with focusing on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly describes post-conventional level as considering 'broader universal principles' which matches the focus on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model refers to the tendency to view a past event as the only possible outcome, rather than considering other potential scenarios that could have occurred but did not. This mindset fosters hindsight bias by strengthening the belief that we always knew the event was going to happen.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly defines a causal model as a 'tendency to view a past event as the only possible outcome' rather than correctly identifying it as a coherent narrative explaining how past events are related.
- Correct: The student correctly explains that causal models contribute to hindsight bias by making events seem inevitable and strengthening the belief that 'we always knew' the outcome would occur.

Score: 0.5

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Learning contributes to hindsight bias because once information is learned, it becomes difficult to ignore when reflecting on past events, which affects your perception of what knowledge was available at the time. This phenomenon is referred to as the curse of knowledge.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly explains that newly learned information cannot be avoided when estimating past likelihood judgments, and accurately identifies this as the curse of knowledge. The answer captures the core mechanism of how learning contributes to hindsight bias.

Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing refers to a decision-making approach where individuals seek the best possible outcome. Satisficing, on the other hand, involves choosing an option that is simply satisfactory. People with neurotic tendencies are more likely to use the maximizing style.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as seeking the best possible outcome, which aligns with 'trying to make the best choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as choosing an option that is simply satisfactory, which matches 'making a good-enough choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people with neurotic tendencies (high neuroticism trait) are more likely to use the maximizing style, matching the answer key.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

One insight I gained from this course, which relates more to the teaching method than the content, is that using AI would be extremely helpful. I can definitely see how AI could assist with grading projects, which in this case were only assessed on a pass/fail basis with feedback solely from fellow students. Receiving more detailed feedback would have been beneficial, and within a year, AI should be capable of providing that. The exam format is effective as it stands; having 30 open-ended questions is manageable but encourages students to engage more deeply with the material compared to a multiple-choice test. Heymans was a valuable addition to supporting student engagement, though it needs improvement. A major issue I faced was that it didnâ€™t save previous conversations, which was frustrating during practice since it repeated the same question repeatedly. Enhancing Heymans could further boost student interaction with the material. It was excellent for answering questions, clearly explaining concepts, and clarifying whether concepts were related or not. Overall, encouraging deeper student involvement with the subject can be achieved through open-question exams, like the one used, coupled with ample opportunities to prepare for them.

Feedback:
