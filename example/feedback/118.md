## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

System 1 relies on gut feelings and quick thinking, while System 2 involves slower, more deliberate thought to avoid making irrational choices that could lead to regret. System 1 tends to be more influential.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies System 1 as involving 'gut feelings and quick thinking,' which aligns with the answer key's description of intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student accurately describes System 2 as 'slower, more deliberate thought,' which corresponds to the answer key's concept of reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student states that 'System 1 tends to be more influential,' which correctly identifies System 1 as more dominant than System 2 according to Haidt's model.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

The representativeness heuristic is a mental shortcut that involves categorizing something new based on how similar it is to a familiar example and making a judgment accordingly.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process, which matches the first point in the answer key.
- Correct: The student explains that the heuristic involves categorizing based on similarity to familiar examples, which captures the essence of estimating likelihood based on resemblance to stereotypes, as required by the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Establishing an initial reference point (an anchor) that can be modified as necessary; the primacy effect refers to a first impression that remains in your memory but can be revised with additional information. Both involve having an initial reference and then adjusting it.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as establishing an initial reference point, which aligns with the answer key's description of taking the first piece of information as a starting point.
- Incorrect: The student describes the primacy effect as a first impression that can be revised, but misses the key point that it's specifically about better remembering the first piece of information.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both concepts involve having an initial reference point, which captures the essence of overreliance on first information from the answer key.

Score: 0.6666666666666666

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion involves placing much greater emphasis on potential losses than on potential gains. Risk aversion, on the other hand, is the tendency to avoid taking a risk entirely because the potential losses outweigh the benefits, even if the gains are equal to or greater than the losses.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves placing greater emphasis on potential losses than on potential gains, which matches the answer key's definition of weighing losses more heavily than gains.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly defines risk aversion as avoiding risks when potential losses outweigh benefits. The answer key defines risk aversion as preferring certainty over uncertainty, not as a comparison of losses versus gains.

Score: 0.5

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Exaggerating how you'll feel once an event occurs, such as assuming the negative emotions after a breakup will be worse than they actually are. When you base your choices on this exaggerated expectation of feeling bad, fear of the potential losses caused by the risk prevents you from ending the relationship.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies impact bias as exaggerating how you'll feel about future events, which matches the answer key's definition of overestimating the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that impact bias prevents breakups by causing people to assume negative emotions will be worse than they actually are, leading to fear-based decision making that prevents ending relationships.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Anticipating your emotions after making end-of-life decisions is important because some individuals may develop illnesses that prevent them from making these choices later on. Therefore, it’s beneficial to determine your preferences while you are still able to do so.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student does not define affective forecasting as predictions about future emotional states. Instead, they focus on the timing of decision-making and capacity issues.
- Incorrect: The student misses the key insight about the discrepancy between healthy people's predictions and their actual preferences when sick. They focus on making decisions while capable rather than the potential mismatch between predicted and actual emotional responses.

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

They tend to overestimate these values, and there is little distinction between simply low and very low probabilities.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that low probabilities are overestimated according to prospect theory.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states there is little distinction between low and extremely low probabilities, missing that extremely low probabilities are often treated as impossibilities rather than being overestimated.

Score: 0.5

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion emphasizes the emotional pain associated with losing, which is perceived as a negative experience.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes loss aversion in general emotional terms but fails to address the specific utility-based definition required. The answer does not mention that negative utilities are weighted more heavily than positive utilities or that the value function is steeper for losses than gains.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

In expected value theory, decisions are made by identifying the best option assuming ideal conditions and focusing solely on monetary results. In contrast, expected utility theory aims to choose the best possible decision under less-than-ideal circumstances, recognizing that a perfect choice may not be achievable, and it often addresses real-life situations where outcomes may not be purely financial.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory focuses on monetary/financial results while expected utility theory addresses non-financial outcomes and real-life situations beyond pure monetary considerations.
- Incorrect: The student mentions 'ideal vs less-than-ideal conditions' but does not specifically address the key difference regarding risk aversion or heuristics and biases that expected utility theory considers.

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected utility theory evaluates the financial results of a decision and compares them to choose the most rational and optimal outcome. Expected value theory also considers financial outcomes but includes non-financial utilities as well. Multi-attribute utility theory assesses the importance and utility of each attribute to determine the best overall option. Prospect theory considers gains and losses, examines how people perceive probabilities, and accounts for individual biases.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student has confused expected value and expected utility theory. They describe expected value theory as including non-financial utilities, when it should only consider financial outcomes with probabilities.
- Incorrect: The student describes expected utility theory as only evaluating financial results, when it should include subjective utilities beyond just financial outcomes.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that multi-attribute utility theory assesses multiple attributes with importance/utility weights to determine the best option.
- Correct: The student correctly describes prospect theory as considering gains/losses, probability perception, and individual biases, which aligns with it being a descriptive behavioral model.

Score: 0.5

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Loss aversion means placing much greater importance on potential losses than on potential gains. When you focus heavily on avoiding losses, you become more reluctant to take risks.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly defines loss aversion but incorrectly concludes that it makes people more risk averse. The answer key indicates that loss aversion can actually decrease risk aversion and make people risk-seeking when they face potential losses, as people are willing to accept risk to avoid losses.

Score: 0.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning is a method of acquiring new knowledge. Classical conditioning involves learning through association and repeated experiences, while operant conditioning is learning driven by rewards and consequences.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as a learning method, which aligns with the concept of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as learning through association and repeated experiences, which matches the key point about learning associations when things happen together.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning driven by rewards and consequences, which corresponds to the answer key's point about learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory correlation occurs when two events happen at the same time, while causation explains the reason why those events occur together.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student confuses illusory correlation with regular correlation and doesn't address the key distinction that illusory correlation involves perceiving correlation where none exists. The answer also fails to explain that illusory causation involves misinterpreting correlation as causation, instead providing a general definition of causation.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

How to behave pertains to social aspects and typical situations, which are part of a script. Understanding how the healthcare system functions is simply factual knowledge you have acquired or not, fitting the definition of a schema.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that understanding the healthcare system is a schema because it involves factual knowledge, which aligns with the answer key's explanation that schemas correspond to knowledge and relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script because it involves social aspects and typical situations, which matches the answer key's explanation that scripts are social schemas describing behavior in specific situations.

Score: 1.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

intentional stance focuses on human traits such as behavior rather than examining the physical body itself.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the intentional stance as the one behaviorists adopted, when the correct answer is the physical stance. Additionally, the student's explanation that the intentional stance focuses on behavior is incorrect - the intentional stance actually focuses on beliefs, desires, and mental states, while behaviorists specifically rejected mental states and focused on physical stimulus-response processes.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

physical stance - since psychologists focus on the practicality of a bodily trait

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the physical stance instead of the design stance. While they mention 'practicality of a bodily trait,' evolutionary psychology focuses on the functional purpose and design of psychological processes, not their physical/mechanical implementation, which is what characterizes the design stance rather than the physical stance.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Distinctiveness - if doing A causes B, and stopping A causes B to stop as well. Plausibility - it is logically believable that when A occurs, B also occurs. Contiguity in time and space - B follows immediately after A happens. Similarity in cause and effect - A leads to B occurring. Consistency - B happens every time A takes place.

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies distinctiveness and provides a reasonable explanation about A causing B and stopping A causing B to stop, which captures the essence of specificity.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies consistency and accurately explains that B happens every time A takes place, matching the answer key's definition.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies plausibility and provides an appropriate explanation about logical believability, which aligns with the common sense aspect from the answer key.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies contiguity in time and space and explains that B follows immediately after A, capturing the temporal aspect though not explicitly mentioning spatial proximity.
- Incorrect: Student mentions similarity in cause and effect but fails to explain the key concept that A and B should superficially resemble each other; instead provides a generic causal statement.

Score: 0.8

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Negativity bias involves focusing on negative information because it captures our attention. The availability heuristic relies on the likelihood of an event based on examples we are familiar with. When negativity bias draws us to negative details, we may use those examples in the availability heuristic to overestimate how likely something is. For instance, reading about shark attacks (negativity bias) might make someone fearful at the beach because they recall those attacks (availability heuristic), even though the actual risk is very low.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines negativity bias as focusing on negative information that captures our attention, which aligns with the answer key's description of seeking out or placing more weight on negative information.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the availability heuristic as estimating likelihood based on familiar examples, which matches the answer key's definition of estimating frequency/probability based on ease of recall.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of how the two biases work together - negativity bias draws attention to negative content, which then influences availability heuristic to overestimate likelihood. While they use a shark attack example rather than moral outrage, the mechanism is correctly explained.

Score: 1.0

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

The fundamental framework theories come from biology, physics, and psychology. In biology, disliking someone leads you to view them and their actions negatively, which transfers that negativity to the object associated with them. Physics suggests that the physical makeup of an item used by a disliked person changes permanently, similar to a chemical reaction, making it "contaminated" for others. Psychology explains that because the disliked person has used the object, it carries negative emotional significance, causing people to feel aversion toward it.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that biological concepts of contagion are being inappropriately applied to social/psychological situations. They explain how the biological framework of contamination is being used to understand social aversion to objects associated with disliked people, which demonstrates understanding of cross-domain transfer of framework theories.

Score: 1.0

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A delusional conspiracy is one founded on clearly false information, whereas non-delusional conspiracies rely on information that is true.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student focuses on whether the underlying information is true or false, but misses the key distinction from the answer key that delusional conspiracy theories are characterized by being both irrational beliefs AND not commonly accepted by society, regardless of the truth value of the information.

Score: 0.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

convictions, online platforms, mass appeal politics

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentioned 'convictions' which does not match any of the specific cognitive and personality factors listed in the answer key such as seeing patterns in randomness, believing paranormal phenomena, or attributing agency where it doesn't exist.
- Incorrect: The student mentioned 'online platforms' which refers to external media/technology factors rather than the internal cognitive and personality factors specified in the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student mentioned 'mass appeal politics' which refers to political/social factors rather than the cognitive and personality factors like narcissism, low intelligence, or low analytical thinking listed in the answer key.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

By receiving a significant amount of feedback, you can use it as a learning tool to improve and correct your errors.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes how incorrect answers can help learning through feedback, but does not identify the specific psychological mechanism by which incorrect answers can interfere with learning. The answer key requires mentioning source amnesia, proactive interference, or the continued-influence effect as mechanisms of interference, not mechanisms of improvement.

Score: 0.0

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

Framing involves altering the way information is expressed to maintain the same options while making one option seem more appealing.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes framing, which is about how information is presented to influence choice, but the question asks specifically about the psychological mechanism behind repetition making messages more attractive. The correct answer should mention mere exposure effect or illusory-truth effect, not framing.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Yes, because they tend to have a more negative outlook.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that major depressive disorder makes people less accurate at predictions due to negative outlook, when the correct answer is that it makes them more accurate by reducing overly optimistic biases.

Score: 0.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

As the trustworthiness of the information diminishes, your initial beliefs begin to shift because the information shaping your perception, along with your beliefs, is also altering.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that prior beliefs 'shift' when sensory reliability decreases. The correct concept is that prior beliefs have increased influence on perception when sensory information is unreliable, not that the beliefs themselves change.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

Pre-conventional (stages 1 and 2) - centered on seeking rewards and avoiding punishment. Conventional (stages 3 and 4) - concentrated on understanding and learning from errors. Post-conventional (stages 5 and 6) - aimed at honing and applying the skills acquired.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that the pre-conventional level is centered on seeking rewards and avoiding punishment, which matches the answer key's description of focusing on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Incorrect: The student describes the conventional level as 'concentrated on understanding and learning from errors,' which does not match the answer key's description of focusing on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Incorrect: The student describes the post-conventional level as 'aimed at honing and applying the skills acquired,' which does not match the answer key's description of focusing on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model explains the reason why two events occur simultaneously. This can lead to hindsight bias, which is the feeling that you predicted the past event all along, as the model can be used to determine the result of that past event.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly defines a causal model as explaining simultaneous events, rather than as a coherent narrative of how past events are related in sequence.
- Incorrect: While the student mentions hindsight bias and prediction, they miss the key mechanism that causal models make events seem more inevitable than they actually were.

Score: 0.0

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Once you have acquired knowledge, it is difficult to forget it. Therefore, after learning about an event, you can't erase that understanding, which leads you to believe that you always knew it.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that newly acquired knowledge cannot be ignored when making retrospective judgments, leading to overestimation of past knowledge. This captures the core mechanism of hindsight bias - the inability to disregard information learned after the fact when estimating what one knew before.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing involves seeking the absolute best choice, while satisficing means selecting a good enough option given certain limitations.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as seeking the absolute best choice, which aligns with 'trying to make the best choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as selecting a good enough option given limitations, which matches 'making a good-enough choice' from the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student did not address the relationship between high neuroticism and decision style, failing to mention that high neuroticism is associated with maximizing decision style.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

By applying nudges and establishing an interactive default setting, similar to the organ donation example from the lecture, you can promote engagement. Additionally, offering a reward for participating interactively may further motivate students to adopt an interactive approach.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement by applying specific concepts from the course (nudges, default settings, organ donation example) to the educational context and proposing concrete solutions (interactive defaults, rewards for participation) that address the challenge of promoting student engagement with limited resources.
