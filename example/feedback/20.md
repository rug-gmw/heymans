## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

System 1 represents instinctive moral judgments and is more influential, while System 2 involves deliberate moral thinking.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 represents instinctive moral judgments, which aligns with the answer key's description of System 1 as intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 2 involves deliberate moral thinking, which matches the answer key's description of System 2 as reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student correctly states that System 1 is more influential, which aligns with the answer key's requirement that System 1 thinking is more dominant than System 2 thinking.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

The representativeness heuristic involves classifying something into a category based on how closely it resembles the typical features of that category.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student does not explicitly identify that the representativeness heuristic underlies the assumption about the colleague being a fashion model.
- Correct: The student correctly explains that the representativeness heuristic involves classifying based on resemblance to typical features of a category, which matches the answer key's explanation about estimating likelihood based on resemblance to stereotypes.

Score: 0.5

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring involves relying on the initial piece of information as a reference point for evaluating subsequent information, while the primacy effect means that the first information received about something strongly shapes overall impressions. Both tend to be disproportionately influential and are challenging to change afterward.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes anchoring as relying on initial information as a reference point, which aligns with the answer key's definition of taking the first piece of information as the starting point.
- Incorrect: The student describes primacy effect as first information shaping overall impressions, but the answer key specifically defines it as the tendency to better remember the first piece of information, which is different from forming impressions.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both phenomena involve disproportionate influence of first information and resistance to change, which captures the essence of overreliance on first information mentioned in the answer key.

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Risk aversion involves steering clear of uncertain risks, while loss aversion refers to giving more importance to losses than to gains.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves giving more importance to losses than to gains, which matches the answer key's definition of weighing losses more heavily than gains.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that risk aversion involves steering clear of uncertain risks, which aligns with the answer key's definition of preferring certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 1.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias refers to the tendency to overpredict how strongly an event will affect our emotions. For example, people might believe they will feel more sadness because of a breakup than they actually experienced during the relationship itself.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as overpredicting how strongly an event will affect emotions, which matches the answer key's definition of overestimating the impact of future events on future feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly explains how impact bias prevents breakups by stating people overpredict the sadness from a breakup, which aligns with the answer key's point about overestimating how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves anticipating the emotions that a future decision will generate, and these expected feelings significantly impact current decision-making. It's crucial to recognize this because people are generally poor at affective forecasting, as demonstrated by the disability paradox, which reveals that although individuals may say they would prefer death over disability, once they become disabled, they often change their perspective and withdraw that statement.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies affective forecasting as predicting future emotional states, though they frame it as 'anticipating emotions a decision will generate' rather than direct predictions about emotional states.
- Correct: The student accurately captures the core concept that healthy people may prefer death when imagining illness/disability, but change their preferences when actually experiencing those conditions, using the disability paradox as a relevant example.

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

People often exaggerate the likelihood of unlikely events but tend to overlook events with extremely small chances.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people 'exaggerate the likelihood of unlikely events,' which aligns with the answer key point that merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Correct: The student correctly states that people 'tend to overlook events with extremely small chances,' which corresponds to the answer key point that extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

disutility

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The answer 'disutility' only identifies that losses create negative utility but fails to capture the key aspect of loss aversion - that losses are weighted more heavily than equivalent gains, or that the value function is steeper for losses than gains.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected utility theory incorporates loss aversion, whereas expected value theory considers only the financial outcome, and expected utility theory evaluates outcomes based on overall utility in various forms.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory focuses on financial outcomes while expected utility theory considers broader utility measures, which aligns with the distinction between financial vs non-financial values.
- Correct: The student mentions loss aversion as a feature of expected utility theory, which is a behavioral bias related to risk preferences, matching the answer key's point about expected utility theory considering risk aversion while expected value theory does not.

Score: 1.0

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected value model - the most logical choice is the one that yields the highest monetary gain. Expected utility model - the best decision maximizes utility, considering the tendency to avoid losses. Multi-attribute utility model - used for complicated decisions, assigning different weights to attributes based on their importance to the decision maker. Prospect theory - builds on expected utility theory by incorporating cognitive biases and mental shortcuts.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as focusing on monetary outcomes and choosing the option with highest expected value, though they don't explicitly mention probabilities.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected utility theory as maximizing utility and mentions loss aversion, which aligns with the key concept that outcomes have subjective utility beyond just financial value.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies multi-attribute utility theory as involving multiple attributes with different weights based on importance, which matches the answer key's description of attributes having utilities and weights.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies prospect theory as building on expected utility theory while incorporating cognitive biases and mental shortcuts, which aligns with it being a descriptive model that considers heuristics and biases.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

The degree of risk aversion driven by loss aversion varies based on how the situation is presented: when framed as a loss, individuals tend to take more risks to avoid the loss, whereas when framed as a gain, they are more likely to be risk-averse to preserve the gain.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion can make people risk-seeking when facing potential losses, which decreases their typical risk aversion. The framing explanation with gains vs losses demonstrates understanding of how loss aversion affects risk preferences in different contexts.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves acquiring associations based on experiences of events occurring together. Classical conditioning refers to learning that two events consistently happen simultaneously, while operant conditioning involves understanding that a particular behavior results in a specific outcome.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as acquiring associations based on experiences of events occurring together, which aligns with the answer key's definition of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as learning that two events consistently happen simultaneously, which matches the answer key's explanation of learning to associate things that tend to happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as understanding that a particular behavior results in a specific outcome, which corresponds to the answer key's definition of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory correlation involves mistakenly perceiving a relationship where none exists, while illusory causation involves incorrectly assuming a cause-and-effect relationship between variables that may actually be correlated.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that illusory correlation is perceiving a relationship where none exists, and illusory causation is incorrectly assuming causation. While the phrasing differs slightly from the answer key, the core distinction is accurate - illusory correlation is about perceiving non-existent correlations, while illusory causation is about misinterpreting correlation as causation.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

A script is a social framework used to understand typical situations—such as a birthday celebration. A schema organizes knowledge, like a framework, to apply it to various related ideas. Similarly, the healthcare system is a broad concept that can be clarified through connected related concepts.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that understanding the Dutch healthcare system is a schema and provides an accurate explanation that it organizes knowledge as a framework applied to related concepts, which aligns with the answer key's explanation about schemas corresponding to knowledge and relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script and accurately explains it as a social framework for understanding typical situations, which matches the answer key's description of scripts as social schemas describing behavior in specific situations.

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

Design stance because they attempt to explain behavior by considering the engineering principles behind how stimuli cause responses.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the design stance instead of the physical stance. While they correctly understand that behaviorists focused on how stimuli cause responses, the design stance involves explaining behavior in terms of purpose or function, whereas behaviorists adopted the physical stance by focusing on the mechanical/causal processes of stimulus-response relationships without considering purpose or design.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

They take an intuitive approach because they want to understand and explain the functioning of the mind.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the stance as 'intuitive approach' rather than the design stance. While they correctly mention understanding functioning, they don't demonstrate knowledge of Dennett's specific stances or explain why evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance when analyzing psychological processes in terms of their adaptive function.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Distinct - when event A occurs, event B also takes place. Consistent - event B happens every time event A occurs. Plausible - given what I know about event A, it is reasonable that it could lead to event B. Contiguity of time and space - event B follows immediately after event A only if event A happens. Similar cause and effect - if one factor causes event A, a comparable cause leads to event B.

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies distinctness and explains it as B occurring when A occurs, which captures the core concept of specificity in causal relationships.
- Correct: Student accurately describes consistency as B happening every time A occurs, which matches the answer key's definition perfectly.
- Correct: Student correctly explains plausibility as it being reasonable that A could lead to B based on knowledge, which aligns with the common sense aspect from the answer key.
- Incorrect: Student misunderstands contiguity - they describe temporal sequence rather than spatial and temporal proximity. The answer key emphasizes same time and location, not just immediate following.
- Incorrect: Student completely misinterprets similarity in cause and effect. They describe comparable causes leading to different effects, while the answer key refers to superficial resemblance between A and B themselves.

Score: 0.6

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Availability bias occurs when we judge how often something happens by how quickly it comes to mind. Negativity bias leads us to focus more on negative emotional content, such as outrage. Because we tend to seek out negative information, we encounter it more frequently, making it easier to remember and causing us to overestimate how often it occurs due to availability bias.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias and explains it as focusing more on negative emotional content like outrage, which aligns with the answer key's definition.
- Correct: The student accurately describes availability bias (referred to as 'availability bias') as judging frequency by how quickly examples come to mind, matching the answer key's description of the availability heuristic.
- Correct: The student effectively explains the connection between the two biases - negativity bias causes us to seek out negative information, making outrage examples more memorable, which through availability bias leads to overestimating frequency of moral outrage.

Score: 1.0

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

The knowledge framework from one domain is mistakenly used in another; for instance, biological concepts are incorrectly applied to psychology—you fear that your aversion to him (a psychological issue) is somehow attached to his belongings like a disease (a biological notion).

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that biological concepts (specifically contagion/disease transmission) are being inappropriately applied to the psychological/social domain, demonstrating understanding of how framework theories from different knowledge domains can be misapplied.

Score: 1.0

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

The reason they are supported is whether it involves making sense of things (delusional) or if it is engaging in propaganda or seeking attention (non-delusional).

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's answer focuses on motivations behind conspiracy theories (making sense vs. propaganda/attention-seeking) rather than the key distinction provided in the answer key, which is based on whether the belief is both irrational and not commonly accepted.

Score: 0.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

drawing attention, engaging participation, and interpreting information

Feedback:

- Incorrect: Drawing attention does not match any of the cognitive or personality factors listed in the answer key that contribute to conspiratorial thinking.
- Incorrect: Engaging participation is not mentioned in the answer key as a factor contributing to conspiratorial thinking.
- Incorrect: Interpreting information is too vague and does not specifically match any of the factors in the answer key such as seeing patterns in randomness or attributing agency inappropriately.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Our thinking remains strongly shaped by earlier beliefs, even after we revise our views.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's answer describes a general tendency for prior beliefs to influence thinking but does not identify the specific psychological mechanism. The answer key requires naming source amnesia (or alternative mechanisms like proactive interference or continued-influence effect) and explaining how incorrect quiz answers can be mistaken for correct ones.

Score: 0.0

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

familiarity bias

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the psychological mechanism. 'Familiarity bias' is essentially the same concept as mere exposure effect - both refer to the tendency to prefer things we are familiar with through repeated exposure.

Score: 1.0

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

No, it actually improves their accuracy because the positivity bias causes us to underestimate the chances of negative events occurring.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that major depressive disorder does not make people less accurate (answering 'No'), and accurately explains that this is because people typically have a positivity bias that leads them to underestimate negative events, which aligns with the answer key's point about reduced overly optimistic tendencies in depression leading to greater accuracy.

Score: 1.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

The posterior perception is more strongly shaped by prior beliefs.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that prior beliefs have increased influence on perception when sensory reliability decreases, using appropriate terminology ('posterior perception') that demonstrates understanding of Bayesian inference in the ideal observer model.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

Pre-conventional - behavior is guided by a basic sense of reciprocity and judged based on the outcomes. Conventional - motivated by the desire to be viewed positively by others and to follow laws, taking others' feelings into account. Post-conventional - understanding that moral principles can sometimes clash, and focusing on universal ethical standards.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the pre-conventional level as being guided by outcomes and basic reciprocity, which aligns with the focus on avoiding punishment and gaining rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as being motivated by desire for positive social perception, following laws, and considering others' feelings, which matches the focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly describes the post-conventional level as focusing on universal ethical standards and understanding moral principle conflicts, which aligns with the focus on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

The causal model naturally creates a logical cause-and-effect explanation for events that occurred, but not for those that did not happen, which makes actual past events easier to comprehend and therefore simpler to recall.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a causal model creates a logical cause-and-effect explanation for events, which aligns with the answer key's definition of a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student explains that the causal model makes actual events easier to comprehend and recall by providing explanations only for what happened (not what didn't), which captures the essence of how causal models contribute to hindsight bias by making events seem more inevitable.

Score: 1.0

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

When trying to revisit your initial thought process, it's impossible to exclude new information gained about the original event, which increases the likelihood of hindsight bias.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that newly learned information cannot be excluded when revisiting past judgments, which is the core mechanism of how learning contributes to hindsight bias. The answer captures the essential idea that new knowledge interferes with accurate recall of prior likelihood estimates.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing involves seeking the best possible outcome when making a decision, while satisficing aims for a result that simply meets your requirements. Individuals with high levels of neuroticism are more prone to use the maximizing approach to decision-making.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as seeking the best possible outcome, which aligns with 'trying to make the best choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as aiming for a result that meets requirements, which corresponds to 'making a good-enough choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that individuals with high neuroticism are more prone to use the maximizing approach, matching the answer key's expectation.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

There may be a total of 10 weekly exercises, with 2 assigned each week. Incentives are offered depending on how many exercises are completed: completing 5 is required to take the exam, 8 adds 0.5 to the final grade if passed, and 10 adds 1 to the final grade if passed. According to the expected utility model, doing all 10 exercises is the most rational decision.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement by proposing a specific incentive structure for weekly exercises with clear requirements and grade bonuses. They connect this to behavioral economics theory (expected utility model) and provide a logical framework for encouraging student participation without requiring intensive personalized feedback. This shows thoughtful consideration of the practical constraints mentioned in the question.
