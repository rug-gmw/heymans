## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

System 1 suggests that moral judgments are primarily driven by intuition.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 involves intuition in moral judgments, which aligns with the answer key's requirement about System 1 referring to intuitions/emotion.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention System 2 thinking or its role in reasoning/rational thought/deliberation as required by the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student does not address which system is more dominant according to Haidt's model, missing the key point that System 1 is more dominant than System 2.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

The representative heuristic is a mental shortcut where if X looks like several examples of category Y, then X is likely to belong to Y.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process, though with a minor spelling variation ('representative' instead of 'representativeness').
- Correct: The student accurately explains the heuristic as estimating category membership based on similarity to examples/stereotypes of that category, which matches the key concept of judging likelihood based on resemblance.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring is a process where the initial number linked to something serves as a reference point, causing all following numbers to be compared against it. The primacy effect suggests that the initial moments of meeting someone are crucial in shaping the overall impression they make. Both phenomena depend on using the first piece of information as the mental baseline for interpreting what comes afterward.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as using initial information as a reference point, though they specifically mention 'numbers' rather than 'information' more broadly. The core concept is accurately captured.
- Incorrect: The student describes the primacy effect in terms of first impressions when meeting someone, but the answer key refers to better remembering the first piece of information. This is a different psychological phenomenon.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both phenomena involve using the first piece of information as a baseline or reference point for subsequent processing, which aligns with the overreliance concept in the answer key.

Score: 0.6666666666666666

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion involves changing one's behavior to prevent a potential loss, while risk aversion refers to steering clear of risks, particularly when they are uncertain or cause fear.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes loss aversion as 'changing behavior to prevent potential loss' which misses the key concept that losses are weighted more heavily than equivalent gains. This describes loss avoidance behavior rather than the cognitive bias of asymmetric valuation.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that risk aversion involves 'steering clear of risks' and mentions uncertainty, which captures the essence of preferring certainty over uncertainty, though the phrasing is less precise than the answer key.

Score: 0.5

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

It is the inclination to exaggerate how negatively something will affect our emotions. This can stop people from ending relationships because they think the breakup will cause more unhappiness than it truly would.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies impact bias as the tendency to overestimate emotional impact of future events, though they phrase it specifically in terms of negative effects rather than the general concept.
- Correct: The student accurately explains how impact bias prevents breakups by describing how people overestimate the negative emotional impact of breaking up, which matches the answer key's explanation.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting refers to how our decisions are influenced by our expectations of future emotions. Since end-of-life choices are highly important, it is crucial to recognize biases linked to affective forecasting, like impact bias. When making end-of-life decisions, we should keep in mind that the emotional effect of events, such as becoming disabled, is often less intense than people usually anticipate.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies affective forecasting as relating to expectations of future emotions, which aligns with the answer key's definition of predictions about future emotional states.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of the key concept by explaining that people overestimate emotional impacts (impact bias) and specifically mentions that becoming disabled has less intense emotional effects than anticipated, which captures the essence of healthy people potentially changing their preferences when actually experiencing illness.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

People tend to overvalue small probabilities but overlook those that are extremely low.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people overvalue small probabilities, which aligns with the answer key's point about merely low probabilities being overestimated.
- Correct: The student correctly states that extremely low probabilities are overlooked, which corresponds to the answer key's point about extremely low probabilities being interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

The prevention of negative utility

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's answer 'The prevention of negative utility' does not capture what loss aversion reflects in prospect theory. Loss aversion is about the asymmetric weighting of losses versus gains (losses being weighted more heavily), not about preventing negative utility altogether.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory applies solely to financial contexts, whereas expected utility theory is relevant in more subjective scenarios and also considers loss aversion.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory applies to financial contexts while expected utility theory extends beyond financial values to more subjective scenarios, which aligns with the answer key's distinction between financial and non-financial values.
- Correct: The student mentions that expected utility theory considers loss aversion, which is a form of risk aversion and represents the kind of heuristics and biases that expected utility theory accounts for, unlike expected value theory.

Score: 1.0

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected value theory involves determining the optimal result in financial scenarios. Expected utility theory focuses on identifying the best outcome in subjective contexts while considering loss aversion. Multi-attribute utility theory assesses the best decision in subjective situations that involve several attributes, each with varying utilities and weights. Prospect theory builds on multi-attribute utility theory by incorporating cognitive biases and heuristics.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as dealing with financial scenarios and optimal results, which aligns with the answer key's description of a normative model with financial outcomes and probabilities.
- Incorrect: While the student mentions subjective contexts correctly, they incorrectly add 'loss aversion' which is not a defining feature of expected utility theory but rather belongs to prospect theory.
- Correct: The student accurately describes multi-attribute utility theory as involving multiple attributes with varying utilities and weights in subjective decision-making situations.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that prospect theory builds on multi-attribute utility theory, when it actually builds on expected utility theory by adding cognitive biases and heuristics.

Score: 0.5

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

The prospect of an immediate loss causes individuals to become less cautious and more willing to take risks to prevent those losses.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion leads people to become more willing to take risks when trying to avoid losses, which directly matches the key point that loss aversion can decrease risk aversion and make people risk-seeking.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

It is the process of forming a connection between two related elements. Classical conditioning involves linking two events or behaviors, while operant conditioning involves connecting a behavior with a consequence, such as a reward or punishment.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as forming connections/associations between elements, which aligns with the key concept of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as linking two events or behaviors, which matches the answer key's description of learning to associate things that happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as connecting behavior with consequences like rewards or punishments, which directly corresponds to the answer key's definition of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation occurs when a false cause is assigned to an event due to a perceived correlation. Illusory correlation refers to the mistaken belief that two events are related when they actually are not.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly distinguishes between illusory causation (incorrectly interpreting correlation as causation) and illusory correlation (perceiving correlation where none exists). The answer accurately captures that illusory causation involves assigning false causality to correlated events, while illusory correlation involves perceiving relationships between unrelated variables.

Score: 1.0

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

A schema refers to a general understanding of a concept, such as the healthcare system. In contrast, a script is a type of schema that outlines expected behaviors in social settings, like how to act at a birthday party, which aligns more with the second example.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that understanding the Dutch healthcare system is a schema and provides an appropriate rationale that it represents general conceptual knowledge, which aligns with the answer key's explanation about knowledge and relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script and accurately explains that scripts outline expected behaviors in social settings, which matches the answer key's description of scripts as social schemas for specific situational behavior.

Score: 1.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

The physical (mechanical) perspective focuses on analyzing phenomena through physical explanations, like how A leads to B.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the physical stance and provides an accurate explanation that aligns with behaviorist focus on stimulus-response mechanisms, though they could have been more explicit about connecting this to behaviorism's emphasis on observable, measurable processes rather than mental states.

Score: 1.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

They take the design stance because it addresses the level of analysis focused on function.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance and provides the accurate rationale that this stance focuses on function, which aligns with evolutionary psychology's approach of analyzing psychological processes in terms of their adaptive utility.

Score: 1.0

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Temporal and spatial proximity: Events A and B occur in the same location within a defined period. Likelihood: It is reasonable to assume that A causes B. Regularity: Whenever A occurs, B follows. Exclusivity: B only takes place if preceded by A. Potential cause-and-effect relationship:

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies contiguity in time and space, describing events occurring in the same location within a defined period, which matches the answer key concept.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies plausibility with 'likelihood' and 'reasonable to assume that A causes B', which aligns with the common sense plausibility heuristic.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies consistency with 'regularity: whenever A occurs, B follows', which matches the concept that B always follows A.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies distinctness/specificity with 'exclusivity: B only takes place if preceded by A', which captures the idea that B follows A but not other events.
- Incorrect: Student mentions 'potential cause-and-effect relationship' but provides no explanation or definition, and this does not correspond to the similarity in cause and effect heuristic from the answer key.

Score: 0.8

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Negativity bias refers to our tendency to focus on negative emotions. The availability heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of events based on how often we encounter them and how easily they come to mind. The negativity bias accounts for the frequent exposure to moral outrage online because it evokes strong negative feelings, and due to this frequent exposure combined with the availability heuristic, people believe such outrage is more widespread than it truly is.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias as focusing on negative content/emotions, which aligns with the answer key's description of seeking out or placing more weight on negative information like morally outraged content.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the availability heuristic as estimating likelihood based on how often we encounter events and how easily they come to mind, which matches the answer key's definition.
- Correct: The student correctly explains the causal relationship: negativity bias leads to frequent exposure to moral outrage online, and this frequent exposure combined with availability heuristic causes overestimation of how widespread such outrage is.

Score: 1.0

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

This can be described as the act of preventing oneself from getting a disease.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student only describes the biological aspect of contagion (preventing disease) but fails to identify that this is a case of incorrectly applying biological domain concepts to the social/psychological domain, which is the key point about framework theories and domain confusion.

Score: 0.0

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

The degree to which it is culturally accepted. Likelihood.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies cultural acceptance as a key distinguishing factor, which aligns with the answer key's criterion of 'commonly accepted.' The mention of 'likelihood' also relates to the rationality aspect, though less explicitly.

Score: 1.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

Being male, having limited intelligence, and a tendency to offer straightforward explanations for complicated situations.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'being male' which corresponds to 'being a man' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student mentions 'having limited intelligence' which accurately reflects 'having a low level of intelligence' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student describes 'a tendency to offer straightforward explanations for complicated situations' which correctly captures 'believing in simple explanations for complex events' from the answer key.

Score: 3.0

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

As a result of previous beliefs shaping how we perceive things

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's answer describes general perceptual bias or confirmation bias, but does not specifically address the psychological mechanism by which incorrect quiz answers interfere with learning. The answer key requires mention of source amnesia (forgetting the incorrect answer was wrong), proactive interference (initial incorrect answer interfering with correct one), or the continued-influence effect.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

The phenomenon known as the Mere Exposure effect.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the mere exposure effect as the psychological mechanism by which repeated exposure to stimuli increases preference and attractiveness, which directly answers the question.

Score: 1.0

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

No. It might improve their accuracy since they exhibit less of a positivity bias.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that major depressive disorder does not make people less accurate, and accurately explains that this is because depressed individuals show less positivity bias (equivalent to reduced optimism bias), which can improve their accuracy in predicting negative outcomes.

Score: 1.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

It goes up.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that the influence of prior beliefs increases when sensory reliability decreases, though the answer lacks detail and explanation.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

Pre-Conventional: Morality focused on oneself and basic self-interest. Conventional: Treating others the way you wish to be treated. Post-Conventional: Recognizing that everyone has their own perspective, which may differ from yours, and accepting that this is acceptable.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that pre-conventional morality focuses on self-interest, which aligns with the answer key's description of obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Incorrect: The student describes conventional level as 'treating others the way you wish to be treated' which is more like the golden rule, but doesn't capture the key aspect of focusing on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Incorrect: The student describes post-conventional level as accepting different perspectives, but this doesn't capture the essence of focusing on abstract principles and values that transcend social conventions.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

It is a mental framework that explains how events truly occurred and the reasons behind each event. This model fosters hindsight bias by creating cognitive ease when it is established, which makes the actual outcomes seem unavoidable.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies a causal model as a mental framework that explains how events occurred and their relationships, which aligns with the answer key's description of a coherent narrative of related past events.
- Correct: The student accurately explains how causal models contribute to hindsight bias by making outcomes seem unavoidable, which matches the answer key's point about events seeming more inevitable than they actually were.

Score: 1.0

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Acquiring new information makes it difficult to form judgments without taking that information into account, which in turn alters our perception of past events.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that newly acquired information cannot be avoided when making judgments about past events, which directly explains how learning contributes to hindsight bias by altering our perception of what we previously knew or expected.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

The maximizing decision style involves striving to select the optimal option, while the satisficing style focuses on choosing an option that is sufficiently good. Neuroticism is associated with the maximizing style of decision-making.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines maximizing as striving to select the optimal option, which aligns with 'trying to make the best choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as choosing an option that is sufficiently good, which matches 'making a good-enough choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that neuroticism is associated with the maximizing decision style, directly matching the answer key's requirement.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

I would use a multiple-question format because it can be graded automatically and accurately, or I would research alternative formats or grading methods that allow for both automatic and reliable evaluation.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement by proposing specific solutions (multiple-choice questions for automatic grading) and showing awareness of the need to balance efficiency with educational effectiveness. They also mention researching alternative methods, indicating thoughtful consideration of the constraint-driven problem presented.
