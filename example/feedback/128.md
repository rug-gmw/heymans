## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

System 1 operates quickly and automatically, while System 2 involves careful and intentional thinking. System 1 tends to be the more prevailing mode.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes System 1 as quick and automatic but fails to connect it specifically to intuitions or emotions in moral judgment as required by Haidt's model.
- Incorrect: The student describes System 2 as careful and intentional thinking but does not explicitly identify it as reasoning, rational thought, or deliberation in the context of moral judgment.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 is more dominant ('prevailing mode') than System 2, which aligns with Haidt's social-intuitionist model.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

Representativeness heuristic refers to the tendency to estimate the likelihood of something based on how closely it resembles a typical example of a specific category. Therefore, if A appears more characteristic than B, we are more inclined to believe A belongs to that category. In this case, the colleague's strong resemblance to the typical image of a fashion model leads us to assume they are indeed a fashion model.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive bias in this scenario.
- Correct: The student provides an accurate explanation of the representativeness heuristic, describing how we estimate likelihood based on resemblance to stereotypes or typical examples, and correctly applies this to the fashion model example.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring refers to establishing a reference point, or anchor, which shapes how we interpret any subsequent information on that topic. While later information may adjust this anchor, it still affects our perception of new details. The primacy effect describes how the first information we encounter—such as an initial impression of a person, a first product, or an initial price—has a disproportionately strong impact on how we interpret later information. Both anchoring and the primacy effect share the characteristic of giving the initial information or impression an excessively strong influence.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as establishing a reference point that shapes interpretation of subsequent information, which aligns with the answer key's definition of taking the first piece of information as a starting point.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as the disproportionately strong impact of first information encountered, which corresponds to the answer key's point about better remembering the first piece of information.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both phenomena share the characteristic of giving initial information excessively strong influence, which matches the answer key's point about overreliance on the first piece of information.

Score: 1.0

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency of individuals to strongly prefer avoiding losses rather than acquiring equivalent gains. Risk aversion describes how people tend to steer clear of risky situations, favoring certainty over uncertainty, provided they are not already experiencing losses.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies loss aversion as the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over acquiring equivalent gains, which matches the answer key's definition.
- Correct: The student accurately describes risk aversion as favoring certainty over uncertainty, which aligns with the answer key. The additional clause about 'provided they are not already experiencing losses' shows deeper understanding but doesn't contradict the core definition.

Score: 1.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias is a component of affective forecasting that involves exaggerating the negative emotional impact a future event will have on you. For example, overestimating how painful a breakup will be might stop you from ending an unhappy relationship.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies impact bias as overestimating/exaggerating the emotional impact of future events, which aligns with the answer key's definition of overestimating the impact of future events on future feelings.
- Correct: The student directly addresses how impact bias prevents breakups by explaining that overestimating how painful a breakup will be stops people from ending unhappy relationships, which matches the answer key's point about overestimating how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting refers to predicting how a future event will impact one’s emotions. People often exaggerate how negative they will feel when they become elderly or ill, leading them to express a desire to die if that situation arises. However, when that time actually comes, their feelings often shift (known as the disability paradox). In the worst scenario, someone might have previously signed a document requesting assisted suicide for when they can no longer communicate, yet they remain happy despite their inability to speak, without being able to convey this to others.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines affective forecasting as predicting how future events will impact one's emotions, which aligns with the answer key's definition of predictions about future emotional state.
- Correct: The student accurately explains the core concept that healthy people may predict they'll want to die when sick, but their actual preferences change when they become ill. They enhance this with the disability paradox concept and a concrete example of advance directives.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

People tend to overvalue small probabilities like 10% while undervaluing extremely tiny probabilities such as 0.01%, often because they believe the latter are unlikely to occur.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people overvalue (overestimate) small probabilities like 10%, which aligns with the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly states that extremely tiny probabilities like 0.01% are undervalued because people believe they are unlikely to occur, which matches the answer key's point about treating them as impossibilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency for individuals to give more importance to the unpleasant emotions associated with losses than to the positive emotions linked to gains. In prospect theory, losses carry a significantly negative value.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that losses are weighted more heavily than gains in prospect theory, stating that 'losses carry a significantly negative value' and that people 'give more importance to' losses than gains, which captures the core concept of loss aversion as steeper negative utility.

Score: 1.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory focuses solely on monetary results, whereas expected utility theory encompasses any kind of subjective benefit.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory deals with monetary/financial outcomes while expected utility theory includes subjective benefits beyond just financial values.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention the second key difference about risk aversion and heuristics/biases - they only address the scope of values considered but miss the behavioral aspects.

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected value theory explains how we assign weight to various financial results, without considering biases or shortcuts in thinking. Expected utility theory is similar but accounts for personal preferences or subjective usefulness rather than just financial outcomes. Multi-attribute theory is used when making choices involving several different attributes of utility. Prospect theory incorporates biases and heuristics, viewing outcomes as losses or gains and showing that we tend to misjudge probabilities and the value of those outcomes.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as dealing with financial outcomes and notes it doesn't consider biases, which aligns with it being a normative model.
- Correct: The student accurately describes expected utility theory as similar to expected value theory but accounting for subjective preferences/utility rather than just financial outcomes.
- Incorrect: The student mentions multi-attribute theory involves several attributes but fails to explain the key concepts of weights for attributes and that it's a normative model for choosing between options.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies prospect theory as incorporating biases and heuristics, mentions loss/gain framing, and notes probability misjudgment, capturing its descriptive/behavioral nature.

Score: 0.75

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency for individuals to place greater importance on losses than on gains. Risk aversion is the preference to avoid taking risks. Loss aversion influences how risk-averse people are, as presenting a situation in terms of potential losses makes individuals more inclined to take risks to avoid losing something.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion makes people more willing to take risks when faced with potential losses, which decreases their typical risk aversion. The answer demonstrates understanding that loss aversion can override normal risk-averse behavior.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves learning the connection between two events. Classical conditioning refers to understanding that two events happen simultaneously (for example, the dog learns that the bell signals food, so it starts salivating when it hears the bell). Operant conditioning involves learning that specific behaviors lead to rewards, while others result in punishment.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as learning connections/associations between events, which aligns with the answer key's definition of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as learning that two events happen together, providing a clear example with Pavlov's dog experiment that demonstrates temporal association.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning that behaviors lead to rewards or punishments, which matches the answer key's description of learning that actions cause consequences.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation occurs when individuals believe that one event causes another, even though the two are merely correlated and one does not actually cause the other. Illusory correlation, on the other hand, happens when people perceive a relationship between two events that does not truly exist, often because the events happened together by chance or due to other factors.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that illusory causation involves misinterpreting correlation as causation, and that illusory correlation involves perceiving a relationship between variables that don't actually correlate. The explanations accurately capture the key distinction between these two concepts.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

Comprehending the Dutch healthcare system is a schema because it requires familiarity with various elements that characterize it and distinguish it from other healthcare systems. Knowing the appropriate conduct at a birthday party is a script, as it follows a routine sequence of actions (such as bringing a gift, presenting it to the birthday person, and them opening it, etc.).

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the Dutch healthcare system as a schema and provides a valid explanation that it involves knowledge of various elements and relationships that distinguish it from other systems, which aligns with the concept of schemas as knowledge structures.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies birthday party behavior as a script and provides a good explanation with specific examples of sequential actions (bringing gift, presenting it, opening it), demonstrating understanding that scripts involve behavioral sequences in specific situations.

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

It would be the intentional stance because the goal is to understand why people act as they do. This approach explains behavior by considering a person's desires and beliefs. They aim to examine what causes behavior, such as which stimuli generate motivation.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the intentional stance, which focuses on beliefs and desires to explain behavior. Behaviorists actually adopted the physical stance because they rejected mentalistic explanations and instead focused on observable stimulus-response relationships and the physical processes that cause stimuli to produce behaviors, avoiding any reference to internal mental states.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

They would adopt a design stance (also known as a functional stance) because this perspective explains the purpose of something. In this context, it would explain the role of psychological processes.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the design stance and provides accurate reasoning that this perspective explains purpose/function, which aligns with how evolutionary psychologists view psychological processes in terms of their adaptive function.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

1. Specificity: B occurs only following the occurrence of A. 2. Consistency: B invariably follows after A has taken place. 3. Reasonableness: It is logical for B to occur after A. 4. Proximity in time and location: B takes place soon after and near the location of A. 5. Suitable cause: The action causing B is appropriate to A (e.g., the ball flying away after the football player's leg moves).

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies specificity/distinctness, explaining that B occurs only following A, which matches the answer key's concept that B follows A but not other events.
- Correct: The student accurately describes consistency as B invariably following A, which aligns with the answer key's statement that B always follows A.
- Correct: The student captures plausibility as 'reasonableness' and explains it as logical for B to occur after A, which corresponds to the answer key's common sense plausibility.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies contiguity in time and space as 'proximity in time and location,' explaining B occurs soon after and near A's location.
- Correct: The student describes similarity in cause and effect as 'suitable cause' with an appropriate example of the ball and football player's leg, demonstrating understanding of superficial resemblance between A and B.

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Negativity bias leads us to focus on negative information, and people who feel moral outrage often share negative posts. The availability heuristic means that since we encounter this negative content frequently, it is more prominent in our minds, causing us to believe that a larger number of people are morally outraged.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias and explains it as the tendency to focus on negative information, which aligns with the answer key's description of seeking out or placing more weight on negative information.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the availability heuristic and explains that frequent encounters with content make it more prominent in our minds, which matches the answer key's explanation about estimating frequency based on ease of recall.
- Correct: The student successfully connects how negativity bias leads to more exposure to morally outraged content, which through the availability heuristic causes overestimation of moral outrage prevalence, demonstrating the causal relationship described in the answer key.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

Framework theories are basic understandings or widely accepted ideas about specific areas such as psychology or biology, often clarified using foundational knowledge from psychology.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student provides a general definition of framework theories but fails to address the key concept of magical contagion or explain how biological contagion concepts are misapplied to social/psychological domains. The answer does not connect the biological domain concept of contagion to the social phenomenon described in the question.

Score: 0.0

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A conspiracy theory proposes that influential individuals or groups are involved in a secretive scheme. Whether such a theory is considered delusional varies based on the cultural and situational context. For example, identifying as an atheist is generally accepted today, whereas in the past it might have been regarded as a delusion.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student discusses cultural and situational context with an example about atheism, but fails to address the key distinction that a delusional conspiracy theory requires both irrational belief AND lack of common acceptance, versus non-delusional theories that don't meet both criteria.

Score: 0.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

1. Displaying narcissistic traits 2. Identifying as male 3. Attempting to simplify complicated issues with straightforward answers

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies narcissistic traits as a factor contributing to conspiratorial thinking, which matches 'being narcissistic' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies gender (being male) as a factor contributing to conspiratorial thinking, which matches 'being a man' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the tendency to provide simple explanations for complex issues, which matches 'believing in simple explanations for complex events' from the answer key.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

The wrong answers may be more easily recalled, causing the availability heuristic to disrupt the learning process.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions availability heuristic, which is about judging probability based on ease of recall, but this doesn't address the core mechanism described in the answer key. The correct answer involves source amnesia (forgetting the source of information and mistaking incorrect answers for correct ones) or proactive interference (old incorrect information interfering with new correct information). The availability heuristic is not the relevant psychological mechanism for how incorrect quiz answers interfere with learning.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

Expressing moral outrage. They aim to demonstrate their intention to implement a significant change and emphasize its importance.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's answer about expressing moral outrage and demonstrating intention for change does not address the psychological mechanism of mere exposure or illusory-truth effect. The answer focuses on political strategy rather than the cognitive bias that makes repeated messages more attractive through familiarity.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Positivity bias leads individuals to downplay the chances of negative events occurring to them. Those with major depressive disorder tend to exhibit less positivity bias, resulting in more precise predictions about such outcomes.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people with major depressive disorder are more accurate at predicting negative events because they exhibit less positivity bias (equivalent to reduced optimism bias), leading to more precise/accurate predictions.

Score: 1.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

It grows increasingly significant.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that prior beliefs become more influential when sensory information is less reliable, which matches the key concept that perception relies more heavily on expectations when sensory evidence is unreliable.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

1. Pre-conventional level: Understanding consequences based on rewards, punishments, and self-centered exchanges. 2. Conventional level: Aiming to meet societal moral standards. 3. Post-conventional level: Recognizing that moral norms may not always be correct.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the pre-conventional level as focusing on rewards and punishments, which aligns with the answer key's description of obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as aiming to meet societal moral standards, which corresponds to the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly captures the post-conventional level by recognizing that moral norms may not always be correct, which demonstrates understanding of abstract principles and values beyond conventional rules.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model of past events is an explanation people create to show how one event led to another in the past. Hindsight bias refers to the tendency of individuals to believe they predicted an outcome all along and that others should have predicted it too. Understanding the causal model of past events makes the outcome seem more obvious, and people often forget their previous predictions, leading them to assume that the outcome was always foreseeable to everyone.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies a causal model as an explanation showing how events are connected/related, which aligns with the answer key's description of a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that understanding causal models makes outcomes seem more obvious and foreseeable, which directly corresponds to the answer key's point that events in causal models seem more inevitable, thus contributing to hindsight bias.

Score: 1.0

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Understanding the result or impact of an event increases our likelihood of hindsight bias because this information is more accessible than our initial judgment prior to knowing the outcome. As a result, it easily comes to mind, leading us to believe that everyone should have predicted it.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that learning new information (understanding results/outcomes) makes that information more accessible and interferes with recalling past judgments, which is the core mechanism of hindsight bias described in the answer key.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

A maximizing decision style refers to someone aiming to choose the absolute best option, while a satisficing decision style involves selecting an option that is simply adequate. Individuals with high levels of neuroticism are more likely to use a maximizing approach when making decisions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as aiming to choose the absolute best option, which aligns with the answer key's description of 'trying to make the best choice.'
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as selecting an option that is simply adequate, which matches the answer key's definition of 'making a good-enough choice.'
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that individuals with high neuroticism are more likely to use a maximizing approach, which directly matches the answer key's statement.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

I would utilize nudges, which are effective because they guide students in a certain direction while still allowing them to make their own choices. There are various types of nudges, such as default settings or conditioning, but I would focus on social pressure, where students' actions are made visible to others. To encourage active participation with the material, I would require students to post at least one question each week in an online forum that displays their names. Additionally, each student must respond to another student's question weekly, with the questions being randomly assigned and the responder's name also visible. This approach ensures that students first engage with the content to formulate a question, and then, if they do not know the answer to the question they receive, they need to interact with the material further to provide a response. The visibility of their names is likely to motivate them to participate more thoroughly due to social pressure.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement with the question by providing a specific, well-reasoned approach using behavioral economics concepts (nudges, social pressure). They clearly explain how their proposed solution (weekly forum questions with visible names and mandatory responses) addresses both the goal of active engagement and the constraint of limited time/resources for grading. The answer shows understanding of how visibility creates social pressure that motivates participation, and explains the dual benefit of requiring both question formulation and response to encourage deeper material engagement.
