## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidtâ€™s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

System 1 thinking is quick and automatic, relying on intuition, biases, and mental shortcuts. In contrast, System 2 thinking is deliberate and requires more effort and reasoning. Jonathan Haidt's social intuitionist model of moral judgment primarily aligns with System 1 thinking, as it emphasizes intuition over rational thought.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 thinking relies on intuition, which matches the answer key's requirement that System 1 refers to intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student correctly describes System 2 thinking as deliberate and requiring reasoning, which aligns with the answer key's definition of System 2 as reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student clearly states that Haidt's model 'emphasizes intuition over rational thought,' which correctly identifies System 1 (intuition) as more dominant than System 2 (reasoning).

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

The representativeness bias or heuristic involves judging the likelihood of something belonging to a category based on how closely it matches the typical features of that category. In this process, we disregard the actual probability of the category and focus solely on similarity.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process in this scenario.
- Correct: The student provides an accurate explanation of the representativeness heuristic, describing how we judge likelihood based on similarity to typical features of a category, which matches the answer key's explanation about estimating likelihood based on resemblance to stereotypes.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

The primacy effect means we give too much weight to our initial impression. Anchoring refers to using the first piece of information we encounter as a reference point, which can be modified by new information but remains the main influence. Both concepts emphasize the significance of first impressions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as using the first piece of information as a reference point, which aligns with the answer key's definition of taking the first piece of information as the starting point.
- Incorrect: The student describes the primacy effect as giving too much weight to initial impressions rather than the tendency to better remember the first piece of information, which is a memory phenomenon, not a weighting bias.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both concepts emphasize the significance of first impressions/information, which corresponds to the overreliance on first information mentioned in the answer key.

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Risk aversion refers to our tendency to shy away from taking risks. A risk does not always mean a loss. Loss aversion, on the other hand, is our inclination to avoid losses. According to prospect theory, people evaluate outcomes based on gains and losses rather than their absolute value, and we generally prefer to avoid losses. Interestingly, in efforts to prevent losses, we may sometimes become more willing to take risks.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion is about avoiding losses and mentions that people weigh losses differently than gains, which aligns with the key concept that losses are weighted more heavily than equivalent gains.
- Incorrect: The student describes risk aversion as 'tendency to shy away from taking risks' but doesn't clearly articulate the preference for certainty over uncertainty, which is the core distinction in the answer key.

Score: 0.5

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias refers to the tendency to exaggerate the extent to which a decision will affect our emotions. This bias causes us to overpredict the negative feelings we will experience after losing a relationship, which can lead us to avoid breaking up even when we are unhappy.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as the tendency to exaggerate/overestimate the emotional impact of future events, which aligns with the answer key definition.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that impact bias prevents breakups by causing people to overpredict the negative feelings from losing a relationship, which matches the answer key's explanation about overestimating how bad a breakup will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting refers to predicting how we will feel in the future, but we tend to be poor at it because of impact bias, where we overestimate the effect of a decision. Emotions fade faster than we expect, a phenomenon known as emotional evanescence, and focalism causes us to focus solely on one decision, ignoring other factors that influence our feelings. In end-of-life decisions, this is important to keep in mind since we often exaggerate how negatively we will feel later; the reality is usually less severe than anticipated.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines affective forecasting as predicting how we will feel in the future, which matches the answer key's definition of predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Correct: The student explains that we overestimate negative feelings and that reality is usually less severe than anticipated, which aligns with the answer key's point about healthy people predicting they'll prefer to die when sick but may not actually prefer to die when it happens.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

Prospect theory suggests that we tend to overvalue small probabilities because of our aversion to loss. We struggle to accurately assess probabilities, often viewing extremely low chances (like 0.01%) as impossible, when in reality, these probabilities are just very small but can still have significant effects. This is different from somewhat low probabilities (around 10%), which we also overestimate, driven by our loss aversion.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that merely low probabilities (around 10%) are overestimated, which aligns with the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately states that extremely low probabilities (like 0.01%) are viewed as impossible, which matches the answer key's point about extremely low probabilities being interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion means that individuals prefer to steer clear of losses, causing losses to carry a significantly negative value for them.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that losses carry significantly negative value, which captures the essence that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities in prospect theory's loss aversion concept.

Score: 1.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory focuses solely on financial outcomes, while expected utility theory considers utility beyond just financial gains. Additionally, expected utility theory accounts for risk aversion, which expected value theory does not.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory focuses on financial outcomes while expected utility theory considers utility beyond financial gains, which matches the answer key's distinction between financial and non-financial values.
- Correct: The student accurately states that expected utility theory accounts for risk aversion while expected value theory does not, which aligns with the answer key's point about expected utility theory considering risk aversion whereas expected value theory does not consider heuristics and biases.

Score: 1.0

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesnâ€™t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected value theory is a normative model that focuses solely on financial outcomes when making decisions. Expected utility theory, also normative, considers decision-making based on utility, which isn't limited to financial aspects. Multi-attribute theory is another normative model that evaluates decisions by considering multiple factors, each assigned a specific utility and weight. Prospect theory, on the other hand, is a descriptive model that explains how people actually make decisions, taking biases and heuristics into account. It frames choices in terms of gains and losses rather than absolute values, recognizes our tendency toward loss aversion, and points out that we poorly estimate probabilitiesâ€”often underestimating very low probabilities and treating very high probabilities as almost certain.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as a normative model focused on financial outcomes, which matches the answer key's description of choosing between options with financial outcomes and probabilities.
- Correct: The student accurately describes expected utility theory as normative and based on utility that isn't limited to financial aspects, which aligns with the answer key's explanation of subjective utility beyond financial outcomes.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies multi-attribute theory as a normative model considering multiple factors with assigned utilities and weights, matching the answer key's description of multiple attributes with utilities and weights.
- Correct: The student accurately describes prospect theory as a descriptive model explaining actual decision-making with biases and heuristics, which corresponds to the answer key's description of a descriptive behavioral model considering heuristics and biases.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease peopleâ€™s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

People tend to fear losing something and strive to prevent it, often avoiding risks. When potential losses are small or nonexistent, individuals are generally reluctant to take risks. However, when there is a significant loss at stake, people are more inclined to take risks to escape that loss, even if doing so doesn't necessarily offer greater benefits.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion can make people risk-seeking when trying to avoid losses, explaining that people will take risks to escape significant losses even without greater benefits, which aligns with the key point that loss aversion decreases risk aversion and can make people risk seeking.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves learning connections based on experience. Classical conditioning is acquiring a response to a specific stimulus, while operant conditioning is learning a response due to consequences like punishment or reward.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as learning connections/associations based on experience, which aligns with the answer key's definition of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as acquiring a response to a specific stimulus, which captures the essence of learning associations when things happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning responses due to consequences like punishment or reward, which matches the answer key's definition of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

An illusory correlation occurs when someone believes there is a connection between two things even though none exists. A correlation means that two events often occur together. Illusory causation happens when someone assumes that one event causes another when, in reality, it does not. Causation means that one event directly causes the other.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly distinguishes that illusory correlation involves perceiving a relationship between variables that don't actually correlate, while illusory causation involves incorrectly interpreting a relationship as causal when it is not. The definitions align with the answer key's core distinction between perceiving non-existent correlations versus misinterpreting correlations as causation.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to â€˜properlyâ€™ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

A script is a framework for typical situations, whereas a schema is a broader concept that guides culturally appropriate behavior in various contexts. For example, knowing the expected behavior at a birthday party is a script because it applies to a common scenario. In contrast, understanding how the Dutch healthcare system functions is not about a single situation but rather a general cultural knowledge, making it a schema.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that understanding the Dutch healthcare system is a schema and provides appropriate reasoning that it represents general cultural knowledge rather than situation-specific behavior.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script and accurately explains that it applies to a specific common scenario with expected behaviors.

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

The perspectives include the physical (mechanical), intentional, and design (functional) stances. Behaviorism adopts the physical (mechanical) stance since it concentrates on how stimuli provoke behaviorâ€”specifically, why a stimulus leads to a particular response. This is similar to asking how water leaks through a ceiling rather than questioning why a plant pot has holes or the purpose behind the behavior.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that behaviorists adopted the physical stance and provides accurate reasoning that they focused on the causal processes between stimuli and behavioral responses. The analogy with water leaking through a ceiling effectively illustrates understanding of the mechanical/causal nature of the physical stance.

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

The stances include the physical (mechanical), intentional, and design (functional) perspectives. The intentional stance clarifies why people behave in certain ways by considering their underlying intentions. For example, ingroup favoritism is understood as an intention to encourage the formation of protective communities, revealing the purpose behind this behavior.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the intentional stance as the one adopted by evolutionary psychologists. While they correctly mention that the design stance is the functional perspective, they argue that evolutionary psychology uses the intentional stance by focusing on 'intentions' behind behaviors. However, evolutionary psychology adopts the design stance because it explains psychological processes in terms of their adaptive function or purpose in evolutionary terms, not in terms of conscious intentions.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

-nearby in time and location, does event B occur shortly after and near event A -likely, could event A have reasonably led to event B -comparable in cause and outcome, does event B share a similar cause and effect pattern with event A -clear and precise, is event A uniquely capable of causing event B

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies contiguity in time and space, describing it as events occurring shortly after and near each other.
- Incorrect: Student does not mention consistency - the requirement that B always follows A.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies plausibility, asking whether A could reasonably have led to B.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies similarity in cause and effect, though phrases it as 'comparable in cause and outcome' and 'similar cause and effect pattern'.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies distinctness/specificity, describing it as A being uniquely capable of causing B.

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

The negativity bias refers to our tendency to focus on negative emotional content, while the confirmation bias involves looking for information that supports our existing beliefs. People who feel moral outrage experience negativity, which they actively seek out, and this is intensified because they also look for evidence that confirms their feelings. This leads to an exaggerated perception of the number of morally outraged individuals.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias and explains it as focusing on negative emotional content, which aligns with the answer key's description of seeking out or placing more weight on negative information like morally outraged content.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies confirmation bias as the second bias instead of the availability heuristic. The answer key specifically requires the availability heuristic, which relates to estimating frequency based on ease of recall.
- Incorrect: While the student attempts to explain how the two biases work together, they explain the interaction between negativity bias and confirmation bias rather than the correct interaction between negativity bias and availability heuristic described in the answer key.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

We link an object that once belonged to someone we dislike, causing that object to carry negative emotional associations. As a result, we strongly dislike the object as well. This involves integrating various areas of knowledge.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes the phenomenon of magical contagion but fails to explain it in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge. They don't identify that biological contagion concepts are being incorrectly applied to the social/psychological domain, which is the key theoretical insight requested.

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A delusion is an irrational belief that is not commonly accepted by most people, so the distinction between a delusional conspiracy and a non-delusional one is that the former is not widely believed, while the latter is generally accepted by many.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a delusional conspiracy theory requires both irrationality and lack of common acceptance, while distinguishing it from non-delusional theories that are more widely accepted. The answer demonstrates understanding of the key criteria.

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

Your answer:

- identifying as male - having limited education - experiencing poverty

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'being a man' as a factor contributing to conspiratorial thinking, which matches the answer key.
- Correct: The student mentions 'having limited education' which aligns with 'having a low level of intelligence' from the answer key, as both relate to cognitive limitations.
- Incorrect: The student mentions 'experiencing poverty' which is not listed among the cognitive and personality factors in the answer key.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you donâ€™t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

We tend to lose track of the context in which we acquired certain information, causing us to forget whether the original false statement or the accurate answer was the true one. This happens because of source amnesia, leading us to mistakenly accept the incorrect answer as correct, even though it was not.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies source amnesia as the key mechanism and accurately explains how it works - forgetting the context/source of information leads to confusion between incorrect and correct answers, potentially causing the incorrect answer to be mistaken for the correct one.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

The availability heuristic suggests that we judge something as more likely if it is easier to recall. When a statement is repeated multiple times, it becomes more accessible in our memory when considering that subject. As a result, messages are made more appealing by frequent repetition. Once repeated often, the idea comes to mind more readily, leading people to perceive it as more probable because of the availability heuristic.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly explains the mechanism as the availability heuristic making repeated statements seem more probable. The correct answer is mere exposure effect (preference for familiar things) or illusory-truth effect. The student confuses memory accessibility with preference/attractiveness and doesn't identify the specific psychological mechanism beyond availability heuristic that the question asks for.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Yes, major depressive disorder causes individuals to be less precise when estimating the probability of negative events occurring to them. They tend to be in a more pessimistic mindset and, influenced by negativity bias (including confirmation bias and the availability heuristic), they focus more on negative emotional information, leading them to exaggerate the likelihood of bad things happening.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that people with major depressive disorder are less accurate and overestimate negative events due to pessimism. The answer key indicates that people with depression are actually MORE accurate because they show reduced optimism bias, not increased pessimism that leads to overestimation.

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

The impact of prior beliefs on perception grows stronger as the trustworthiness of sensory information diminishes. In such cases, perception is more heavily shaped by previous experiences.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that prior beliefs have stronger influence on perception when sensory information reliability decreases, and appropriately connects this to previous experiences as a source of these priors.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You donâ€™t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other peopleâ€™s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

At the predescriptive stage of development, we consider actions morally good when they lead to rewards. At the descriptive stage, we view actions as morally good when they make others feel positive, understanding morality from others' emotional perspectives. At the postdescriptive stage, we recognize that moral values can both clash and exist simultaneously.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the pre-conventional level concept of moral reasoning based on rewards, though they use 'predescriptive' instead of 'pre-conventional' terminology.
- Correct: The student accurately captures the conventional level focus on others' feelings and social perspectives, though they use 'descriptive' instead of 'conventional' terminology.
- Incorrect: The student's description of the post-conventional level as recognizing that moral values can clash and exist simultaneously does not capture the key concept of abstract principles and universal values that define this level.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

Hindsight bias is the tendency to believe that a particular outcome was inevitable, even if it was not. A causal model of a past event assumes that one situation led to a specific resultâ€”essentially, that event A caused event B. This belief contributes to hindsight bias because once we learn this causal connection, we incorporate it into our thinking about events A and B. Since we've learned this causal model, it becomes more accessible in our memory (due to the availability heuristic and learning), leading us to assume that the outcome had to occur in that way.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a causal model involves understanding how events are connected, describing it as 'one situation led to a specific result' and 'event A caused event B', which aligns with the answer key's definition of a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student clearly explains how causal models contribute to hindsight bias by making outcomes seem inevitable, stating that 'once we learn this causal connection... we assume that the outcome had to occur in that way', which directly matches the answer key's point about events seeming more inevitable than they were.

Score: 1.0

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Over time, gaining knowledge leads to hindsight bias because we base our thinking on past events and inevitably incorporate the new information we've learned when reflecting on previous decisions. As a result, we tend to believe that the outcome was predictable all along, even though it wasn't clear at the time.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly explains that learning contributes to hindsight bias by making it impossible to avoid incorporating newly acquired information when reflecting on past events, which aligns with the answer key's point about being unable to avoid taking newly learned information into account when estimating past likelihood judgments.

Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing involves aiming to choose the best possible option, while satisficing means settling for a decision that is good enough. Neuroticism is connected to maximizing, as individuals with high levels of neuroticism tend to strive for the optimal choice. Someone who scores high in neuroticism is more likely to use a maximizing approach when making decisions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as 'aiming to choose the best possible option' which aligns with the answer key's definition of 'trying to make the best choice'.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as 'settling for a decision that is good enough' which matches the answer key's definition of 'making a good-enough choice'.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that someone high in neuroticism is 'more likely to use a maximizing approach when making decisions' which matches the answer key's expectation.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

Provide students with practice questions and their answer keys, along with access to all recorded lectures, to encourage critical thinking about the content. Releasing the answer keys only a few days before the exam motivates students to first attempt the questions on their own and review the material before checking their answers and learning from them. To increase social engagement, ask more questions during lectures and inform students beforehand that they will be required to respond. The social pressure to appear knowledgeable can encourage greater participation. Offering a 0.5 bonus for attending at least 80% of lectures gives students additional incentive to attend and actively engage with the material. Additionally, hold a question hour after the final lecture where every student must submit a question, encouraging them to reflect on the content; during this session, their questions can be addressed to further involve them.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement with the question by providing multiple concrete strategies that address the core challenge of promoting active engagement with limited resources. The suggestions include practice questions with delayed answer keys, interactive lecture techniques, attendance incentives, and mandatory question submission sessions. These approaches are practical, scalable, and directly relevant to the constraints mentioned in the question.
