## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

System 1 thinking is quick and automatic, often relied upon for making moral decisions driven by emotions. In contrast, System 2 thinking is slower and more intentional, used for moral choices that depend on reasoning rather than feelings. System 2 tends to be the more influential process.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies System 1 as quick, automatic, and driven by emotions, which aligns with the answer key's description of System 1 as intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student accurately describes System 2 as slower, more intentional, and dependent on reasoning rather than feelings, which matches the answer key's characterization of System 2 as reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that System 2 is more influential, when according to Haidt's social-intuitionist model and the answer key, System 1 (intuition/emotion) is actually more dominant than System 2.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

The representativeness heuristic is a cognitive shortcut used to assess how closely a person or object resembles your mental prototype of a particular category.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process in this scenario.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that the representativeness heuristic involves assessing how closely someone resembles a mental prototype of a category, which matches the key concept of estimating likelihood based on resemblance to stereotypes.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring involves creating an initial reference value that individuals use when making judgments or decisions. The primacy effect refers to placing significant emphasis on information encountered first. Both phenomena influence judgments by prioritizing information presented early.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as creating an initial reference value for judgments/decisions, which aligns with the answer key's description of taking the first piece of information as a starting point.
- Incorrect: The student describes the primacy effect as 'placing significant emphasis on information encountered first' rather than the specific tendency to 'better remember' first information, missing the memory component.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both phenomena involve prioritizing information presented early, which captures the essence of overreliance on first information from the answer key.

Score: 0.6666666666666666

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency to prioritize avoiding losses over acquiring gains, which can lead to making riskier choices. Risk aversion, on the other hand, means that people generally prefer to avoid taking risks.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves prioritizing avoiding losses over acquiring gains, which matches the answer key's description of weighing losses more heavily than gains or preferring to avoid losses over equivalent gains.
- Correct: The student correctly describes risk aversion as people's preference to avoid taking risks, which aligns with the answer key's definition of preferring certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 1.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias refers to the tendency to overestimate how much our choices will affect our future emotions. This bias might lead individuals to remain in unhealthy relationships because they believe ending them will result in future stress and anxiety, so they often choose to avoid breaking up.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies impact bias as overestimating how much future events (choices) will affect future emotions, which matches the answer key's definition.
- Correct: The student explains that impact bias prevents breakups because people overestimate the negative emotional consequences (stress and anxiety), which aligns with the answer key's point about overestimating how bad a breakup will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves predicting how future events will influence your emotions. This is crucial in end-of-life decisions, as medical professionals rely on these predictions when making choices, such as those related to euthanasia.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies affective forecasting as predicting how future events will influence emotions, which aligns with the answer key's definition of predictions about future emotional state.
- Incorrect: The student mentions medical professionals making decisions but misses the key point about healthy people predicting they'd prefer to die when sick, versus their actual preferences when they become sick.

Score: 0.5

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

People often overlook very low probabilities. While they may dismiss extremely unlikely events as impossible, they still acknowledge those that are just unlikely.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student states people 'overlook very low probabilities' and 'acknowledge those that are just unlikely', which contradicts the answer key that merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that extremely low probabilities are 'dismissed as impossible', which aligns with the answer key that they are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 0.5

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

People generally assign greater emotional importance to losses, which is why they are more motivated to avoid losing than to achieve gains.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes loss aversion in general psychological terms but fails to address the specific question about how loss aversion is expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory. The answer does not mention that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities or that the value function is steeper for losses than gains.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected utility takes into account not just monetary value but also personal preferences, and it incorporates loss aversion, unlike expected value theory.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected utility theory considers personal preferences beyond just monetary value, which aligns with the answer key point about expected utility dealing with non-financial values while expected value theory deals only with financial values.
- Correct: The student correctly notes that expected utility theory incorporates loss aversion (a form of risk consideration) while expected value theory does not, which matches the answer key point about expected utility theory considering risk aversion whereas expected value theory does not consider heuristics and biases.

Score: 1.0

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected value theory aims to select the option that will maximize value over time. Expected utility theory builds on this by incorporating utility, accounting for both financial and personal subjective value. Multi-attribute theory evaluates multiple attributes across different choices. Prospect theory is similar to expected utility theory but also takes into account heuristics and biases.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as focusing on maximizing value and mentions it deals with options over time, which aligns with the normative model concept from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes expected utility theory as building on expected value theory by incorporating utility that includes both financial and subjective personal value, matching the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies multi-attribute theory as evaluating multiple attributes across different choices, which corresponds to the answer key's description of multiple attributes with utilities and weights.
- Correct: The student accurately describes prospect theory as similar to expected utility theory but incorporating heuristics and biases, which matches the answer key's description of it being a descriptive behavioral model.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Individuals tend to take more risks when aiming to prevent a loss.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people take more risks when trying to prevent losses, which directly captures the key concept that loss aversion can make people risk-seeking rather than risk-averse.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves learning to connect two stimuli. Classical conditioning is when this connection is made between two stimuli that occur simultaneously. Operant conditioning is learning that a specific behavior leads to a reward or punishment.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as learning connections/associations, which aligns with the key concept of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as connecting two stimuli that occur simultaneously, which matches the answer key's description of associating things that happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning that behavior leads to rewards or punishments, which directly corresponds to the answer key's definition of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

The difference is that illusory causation involves...

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's answer is incomplete - it only begins to define illusory causation but does not provide the complete definition or explain illusory correlation, failing to address the key distinction that illusory causation is misinterpreting correlation as causation while illusory correlation is perceiving correlation where none exists.

Score: 0.0

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

Comprehending the functioning of the healthcare system is considered a schema because it involves a mental framework made up of organized sequences. On the other hand, knowing the expected behavior at a birthday party is a script since it pertains to a routine activity.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly describes a schema as 'organized sequences' which is actually a characteristic of scripts. While they correctly identify the healthcare system as a schema, their reasoning is flawed - schemas are knowledge structures about relationships and concepts, not sequences.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies birthday party behavior as a script and provides appropriate reasoning by describing it as pertaining to a 'routine activity,' which aligns with the concept of scripts as behavioral sequences for specific situations.

Score: 0.5

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

mechanical perspective because it only explains human behavior in terms of physical actions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that behaviorists adopted a mechanistic/physical perspective focused on observable physical processes rather than mental states, which aligns with the physical stance from Dennett's framework.

Score: 1.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

motivational stance, as they explain the reasons behind why people are motivated to act

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the motivational stance instead of the design stance. While evolutionary psychologists do examine motivations, they primarily adopt the design stance because they analyze psychological processes in terms of their adaptive function and evolutionary purpose, not just immediate motivational causes.

Score: 0.0

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Distinctiveness: Event B occurs solely after Event A has happened. Consistency: Event A is invariably succeeded by Event B. Plausibility: There is a reasonable rationale for why Event B follows Event A. Contiguity: Events A and B take place simultaneously in both time and location. Similarity in effect: Event A closely resembles Event B in its outcome.

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies distinctiveness and explains it as B occurring solely after A, which matches the answer key's concept of B following A but not other events.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies consistency and explains it as A invariably being succeeded by B, which aligns with the answer key's 'B always follows A'.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies plausibility and explains it as having a reasonable rationale for why B follows A, which matches the answer key's common sense plausibility.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies contiguity and explains it as events occurring simultaneously in time and location, which matches the answer key's concept of same time and location.
- Incorrect: Student identifies 'similarity in effect' but describes it as A resembling B in outcome, while the answer key specifies 'similarity in cause and effect' where A and B superficially resemble each other - the student's interpretation is too narrow.

Score: 0.8

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

We often believe that others are more likely to have biases than we are. The self-serving bias refers to our tendency to think that we are correct.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student does not mention the negativity bias at all. Instead, they discuss a general tendency to think others are more biased than ourselves, which is not relevant to the question about overestimating moral outrage on social media.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention the availability heuristic. They instead refer to 'self-serving bias' which is incorrectly defined and not one of the two biases that contribute to overestimating moral outrage on social media.
- Incorrect: The student provides no explanation of how the two correct biases work together to cause overestimation of moral outrage. Their answer focuses on unrelated concepts about thinking others are more biased and self-serving bias.

Score: 0.0

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

Framework theories explain that we interpret information according to our general understanding of the world in areas like psychology, physics, and biology. For example, in biology, if you link an object to someone you dislike, you may believe the object is contaminated by that person. In physics, the contiguity heuristic applies because the person and the object were together at the same place and time at some point. In psychology, the object becomes associated with the person you dislike.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that biological concepts of contagion/contamination are being inappropriately applied to social/psychological situations, demonstrating understanding that framework theories from one domain (biology) are being misapplied to another domain (social/psychological).

Score: 1.0

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A non-delusional conspiracy differs from a delusional conspiracy based on how broadly it is accepted.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student only identifies social acceptance as the distinguishing factor, but misses the crucial criterion of rationality/irrationality of the belief itself, which is equally important according to the answer key.

Score: 0.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

Narcissism related to a man who is religious.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies narcissism as one of the cognitive/personality factors contributing to conspiratorial thinking.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies being a man as one of the factors contributing to conspiratorial thinking.
- Incorrect: Being religious is not listed among the factors in the answer key. The student needed to identify a third factor from the provided list.

Score: 2.0

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

effect of first impressions

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student answer 'effect of first impressions' does not address any of the psychological mechanisms mentioned in the answer key (source amnesia, proactive interference, or continued-influence effect). First impressions relate to initial judgments about people or situations, which is not relevant to how incorrect quiz answers can interfere with learning the correct information.

Score: 0.0

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

effects related to the most recent information

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's answer about 'effects related to the most recent information' refers to recency effects, which is not the correct psychological mechanism. The answer key requires mere exposure effect (tendency to prefer familiar things) or illusory-truth effect, neither of which relates to recency of information.

Score: 0.0

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Yes, because when someone has a depressive disorder, negative thoughts are more easily accessible in their mind, leading them to overestimate the likelihood of negative events.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that people with major depressive disorder are less accurate due to overestimating negative events. The correct answer is that they are actually more accurate because they show reduced optimism bias, not because they overestimate risks.

Score: 0.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

Existing beliefs will have a stronger impact on perception.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that prior beliefs (existing beliefs) have a stronger impact on perception when sensory information reliability decreases, which directly matches the key concept from the answer key.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model explains how individuals understand the cause-and-effect connections between events. This relates to hindsight bias because it involves the explanations people create when they believe they predicted an outcome all along, attributing it to one event causing another.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a causal model explains cause-and-effect connections between events, which aligns with the answer key's description of a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Incorrect: While the student mentions that causal models relate to hindsight bias through post-hoc explanations, they don't capture the key mechanism that events in causal models seem more inevitable than they actually were, which is the core contribution to hindsight bias.

Score: 0.5

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

When faced with a specific event, it is nearly unavoidable to consider the actual outcome when assessing the initial probability of that outcome, leading you to believe the outcome was more likely than it truly was.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the core mechanism of hindsight bias - that knowledge of the actual outcome makes it difficult to assess what the initial probability judgment would have been, leading to overestimation of the original likelihood. This captures the essence of how learning (knowing the outcome) contributes to hindsight bias by making it nearly impossible to ignore that new information when making retrospective probability judgments.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing involves aiming for the best possible result, while satisficing means settling for an outcome that is satisfactory. Maximizing is linked to perfectionism, a trait associated with neuroticism, so individuals with high levels of neuroticism are likely to engage in maximizing.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as 'aiming for the best possible result' which aligns with 'trying to make the best choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as 'settling for an outcome that is satisfactory' which matches 'making a good-enough choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that individuals with high neuroticism are likely to engage in maximizing, and provides good reasoning by connecting it to perfectionism.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

Actively engaging with the material can be challenging without personalized feedback and grading. To address this, I would implement an assignment that is peer-reviewed, with the reviewing process itself being graded. This encourages students to become actively involved with the content while managing their time efficiently. Since providing a review requires a thorough understanding of the material, students learn both by completing the assignment and by evaluating their peers' work, reinforcing the knowledge more effectively.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement by identifying the core challenge (limited time/resources vs. need for engagement) and proposing a concrete, well-reasoned solution. The peer-review approach with graded reviewing process shows understanding of educational principles - that reviewing others' work reinforces learning while distributing the grading workload. The answer reflects thoughtful consideration of the constraints and pedagogical benefits.
