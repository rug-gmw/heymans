## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidtâ€™s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

This model suggests that our moral intuitions arise from the emotions elicited by a moral issue, governed by system 1 thinking, which is driven by feelings. In contrast, we often believe that our moral decisions result from system 2 thinking, characterized by rational and conscious deliberation. As a result, system 1 is considered the primary influence.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 thinking is governed by emotions and feelings, which aligns with the answer key's requirement that System 1 refers to intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student accurately describes System 2 thinking as 'rational and conscious deliberation,' which matches the answer key's requirement that System 2 refers to reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student clearly states that 'system 1 is considered the primary influence,' which directly addresses the answer key's requirement that System 1 is more dominant than System 2.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

The heuristic in question is the representativeness heuristic, a mental shortcut that leads us to believe that A belongs to a particular group because A fits our stereotypes of that group.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process in this scenario.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that the representativeness heuristic involves judging membership in a category based on how well someone fits the stereotype of that group, which matches the key concept of estimating likelihood based on resemblance to stereotypes.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

When we develop an impression of a person or thing, the initial information we encounter acts as a reference point, establishing the foundation for our judgment. This phenomenon is known as the anchoring effect. The primacy effect occurs due to this, as the first information we receive significantly shapes the impression we create.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as using initial information as a reference point and foundation for judgment, which aligns with the answer key's definition of taking the first piece of information as the starting point.
- Incorrect: The student describes the primacy effect as being caused by anchoring and shaping impressions, but doesn't correctly identify it as the tendency to better remember the first piece of information.
- Correct: The student implicitly demonstrates understanding of the commonality by explaining that both phenomena involve the significant influence of initial/first information, which matches the overreliance on first information described in the answer key.

Score: 0.6666666666666666

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Risk aversion: Normative models suggest that we consistently steer clear of risk. In contrast, descriptive models argue that we weigh losses more heavily than gains, leading us to focus on avoiding losses (loss aversion), sometimes opting for the riskiest choice if it offers a possibility to prevent loss.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student confuses loss aversion with risk aversion. They describe loss aversion (weighing losses more heavily than gains) as part of descriptive models, but don't clearly define loss aversion as a separate concept from risk aversion.
- Incorrect: The student doesn't clearly define risk aversion as preferring certainty over uncertainty. Instead, they mention normative models suggesting we avoid risk, but this is incomplete and mixed with discussion of loss aversion.

Score: 0.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias is a consistent mistake in our thinking where we overestimate how much certain events will affect our emotions, either positively or negatively. This can lead individuals to remain in unhappy relationships because they assume that ending them will cause more emotional pain than it truly would.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as overestimating how much future events will affect our emotions, which matches the answer key's definition of overestimating the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that impact bias prevents breakups because people assume ending relationships will cause more emotional pain than it actually would, which aligns with the answer key's point about overestimating how bad a breakup will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting refers to the tendency to inaccurately predict how an event will impact our emotions due to certain biases. This concept is especially relevant in end-of-life choices, as when we are healthy, we might claim that if we were seriously ill or disabled, we would choose to die to avoid suffering. However, in reality, when faced with such circumstances, our actual experience of suffering may be less than expected.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies affective forecasting as predictions about future emotional states, though they frame it in terms of inaccuracy and bias rather than simply as predictions.
- Correct: The student accurately explains the key insight that healthy people may predict they would prefer to die when sick, but when actually facing illness, they may not prefer to die due to different actual experiences than predicted.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

People often overrate small chances and underrate extremely small chances, treating them as if they are impossible.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people overrate small chances, which aligns with the answer key point that merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Correct: The student accurately states that extremely small chances are underrated and treated as impossible, which matches the answer key point that extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Losses carry a strong negative value since they are something we want to avoid.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student identifies that losses have negative value but fails to capture the key aspect of loss aversion - that losses are weighted more heavily than equivalent gains. The answer doesn't mention the asymmetric weighting or steeper slope for losses compared to gains, which is the core concept of loss aversion in prospect theory.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

A key distinction is that expected value theory is limited to financial decisions, whereas expected utility theory can be utilized for decisions beyond just financial matters.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory deals with financial values while expected utility theory extends beyond financial matters to include non-financial values.
- Incorrect: The student fails to mention the second key difference regarding risk aversion and heuristics/biases - expected value theory ignores these behavioral factors while expected utility theory incorporates risk aversion.

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesnâ€™t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

First, there are three normative models: Expected value theory applies only to financial decisions and suggests choosing the option that maximizes long-term value. Expected utility theory builds on expected value theory by incorporating the concept of utility, reflecting how desirable an outcome is, allowing it to be used for non-financial decisions. Multi-attribute utility theory further extends expected utility theory by recognizing that options may have various attributes and introducing weights to represent the importance of each attribute for the individual. Finally, prospect theory is a descriptive model that incorporates biases and heuristics to explain how people actually make decisions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as a normative model for financial decisions that involves choosing options to maximize value, which aligns with the answer key's description of choosing between options with financial outcomes and probabilities.
- Correct: The student accurately describes expected utility theory as building on expected value theory by incorporating utility (desirability of outcomes) and extending beyond financial decisions, which matches the answer key's explanation of using subjective utility rather than just financial outcomes.
- Correct: The student correctly explains multi-attribute utility theory as extending expected utility theory to handle multiple attributes with weights representing their importance, which aligns with the answer key's description of options having multiple attributes with utilities and weights.
- Correct: The student accurately identifies prospect theory as a descriptive model that incorporates biases and heuristics to explain actual decision-making, which matches the answer key's description of it being a descriptive/behavioral model similar to expected utility theory but considering heuristics and biases.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease peopleâ€™s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

When the situation is framed as a loss, individuals are more likely to opt for the most uncertain choice, making them less inclined to avoid risk.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion leads people to become risk-seeking when facing potential losses, which reduces their typical risk aversion. The answer captures the key concept that people will accept uncertainty/risk to avoid losses.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning occurs when we form a connection between two events by repeatedly experiencing them simultaneously. In classical conditioning, this involves learning the link between two external stimuli, while in operant conditioning, it involves learning the relationship between our actions and the resulting consequences, such as rewards or punishments.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as forming connections/associations between events through repeated experience, which aligns with learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as learning links between two external stimuli through simultaneous experience, which matches the concept of associating things that happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning the relationship between actions and consequences like rewards or punishments, which directly corresponds to the answer key definition.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation occurs when we mistakenly believe that one event causes another, even though no such cause-and-effect relationship exists, while illusory correlation happens when we perceive a connection between two variables that does not actually exist.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly distinguishes between illusory causation (mistakenly believing one event causes another when no causal relationship exists) and illusory correlation (perceiving a connection between variables that doesn't actually exist). This captures the key difference that illusory causation involves misinterpreting causality while illusory correlation involves perceiving non-existent correlations.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to â€˜properlyâ€™ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

Comprehending the Dutch healthcare system functions as a schema, as it represents general knowledge about what to anticipate in a particular context. Being aware of the appropriate behavior at a birthday party is a script, since it involves culturally specific knowledge of the procedures to follow during the event and is commonly shared among people within the same culture.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the Dutch healthcare system as a schema and provides a reasonable explanation that it represents general knowledge about what to expect in a particular context, which aligns with schemas being knowledge structures about relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies birthday party behavior as a script and explains it involves culturally specific procedural knowledge for events, which accurately captures the concept of scripts as behavioral sequences for specific situations.

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

It is a physical approach, as it focuses on understanding how the brain functions rather than the purposes it serves or our motivations.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly identifies the physical stance but provides an incorrect justification. The answer key specifies that behaviorists adopted the physical stance because they focused on stimulus-response processes, not because they studied brain functions. In fact, behaviorists explicitly avoided studying internal mental processes and brain mechanisms, focusing instead on observable stimulus-behavior relationships.

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

They adopt a design perspective, focusing on the purpose of these psychological processes rather than how they operate or their intended function.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance/perspective and accurately explains that they focus on the purpose/function of psychological processes, which aligns with the answer key's emphasis on considering processes in terms of their function.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Distinctiveness: Event A is more likely to cause event B if B occurs exclusively when A takes place. Contiguity in time and space: Event A is more likely to cause event B if B follows immediately after A and both events are physically near each other. Plausibility: Event A is more likely to cause event B when it is logical for A to lead to B. Consistency: Event A is more likely to cause event B if B repeatedly occurs whenever A happens.

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies distinctiveness and explains it as B occurring exclusively when A takes place, which matches the answer key's concept of specificity.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies consistency and explains it as B repeatedly occurring whenever A happens, which aligns with the answer key's definition.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies plausibility and explains it as logical for A to lead to B, which matches the answer key's common sense explanation.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies contiguity in time and space and explains it as B following immediately after A with physical proximity, which matches the answer key.
- Incorrect: Student fails to mention the fifth heuristic of similarity in cause and effect, where A and B superficially resemble each other.

Score: 0.8

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Negativity bias leads us to focus on negative information. Due to this, we frequently encounter individuals who express moral outrage, making these examples more memorable and causing us to overestimate how many people are actually morally outraged.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias and explains it as the tendency to focus on negative information, which aligns with the answer key's definition.
- Incorrect: The student does not explicitly mention the availability heuristic by name, though they describe a process that resembles it (memorable examples leading to overestimation).
- Correct: The student correctly explains the connection between negativity bias and overestimating moral outrage, showing how focusing on negative content leads to overestimation through memorable examples.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

Magical contagion occurs when we mistakenly transfer biological principles to the physical world, leading us to believe that an object used by someone we dislike can somehow transmit negative traits from that person to us, similar to how germs spread in biology.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that biological contagion principles are being misapplied to another domain. While they specify 'physical world' rather than 'social/psychological/cultural domain,' they demonstrate understanding of the core concept - that biological framework theories about contagion are incorrectly transferred to non-biological situations involving disliked people and their possessions.

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A conspiracy theory is considered delusional if it is rejected by people within the same culture. Therefore, a conspiracy theory may be viewed as delusional in one situation but not in another.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student only identifies cultural acceptance as the distinguishing factor, missing the key criterion that the belief must also be irrational. The answer key requires both irrationality AND lack of common acceptance to classify a conspiracy theory as delusional.

Your answer:

Recognizing order in chaos. Identifying as male. Exhibiting narcissistic traits.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'recognizing order in chaos' which corresponds to 'seeing patterns in randomness' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'identifying as male' which corresponds to 'being a man' from the answer key.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Yes, they are more likely to believe that something negative will occur to them.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that people with major depressive disorder are more likely to believe negative events will occur, but fails to address the key point that this actually makes them MORE accurate at predictions due to reduced optimism bias, not less accurate as the question asks.

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

Prior beliefs have a greater impact on perception.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that prior beliefs have increased influence on perception when sensory information becomes less reliable, which directly matches the key concept from the answer key.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You donâ€™t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other peopleâ€™s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

There are three levels: The pre-conventional level includes two stagesâ€”stage 1, where we behave prosocially to avoid punishment, and stage 2, where we realize that such behavior can benefit us. The conventional level also has two stagesâ€”stage 3, where moral decisions are based on an interpersonal perspective, and stage 4, where we adhere to rules and laws to preserve social order. The post-conventional level, consisting of stages 5 and 6, involves a deeper understanding of morality, allowing us to form our own moral judgments and, if necessary, challenge laws that conflict with these beliefs.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the pre-conventional level as focusing on avoiding punishment and gaining benefits, which aligns with the answer key's description of obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as being based on interpersonal perspectives and adhering to rules to preserve social order, which corresponds to the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly describes the post-conventional level as involving forming one's own moral judgments and potentially challenging laws based on personal beliefs, which matches the answer key's description of focusing on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

When the result of a situation is known, we attempt to find a reason for that result by identifying potential causes within the narrative and assessing how effectively they account for the outcome. If we judge the explanation to be sufficiently convincing, creeping determinism occurs, leading to hindsight bias. If the explanation is deemed inadequate, hindsight bias does not arise.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a causal model involves finding reasons and causes within a narrative to explain outcomes, which aligns with the concept of a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student accurately explains how causal models contribute to hindsight bias through 'creeping determinism' - when explanations are convincing, events seem more inevitable than they were, which is the core mechanism of hindsight bias.

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Once we know the result of a situation, we find it difficult to separate ourselves from that information in order to remember our previous judgments or to consider what someone unaware of the outcome might predict will occur.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that learning new information (knowing the outcome) makes it difficult to separate from that knowledge when recalling past judgments or considering others' perspectives, which captures the essence of how learning contributes to hindsight bias and the curse of knowledge.

Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing involves seeking the optimal choice, whereas satisficing means selecting an option that is acceptable. Neuroticism is associated with maximizing.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies maximizing as seeking the optimal choice, which aligns with 'trying to make the best choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly describes satisficing as selecting an acceptable option, which matches the concept of 'making a good-enough choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that neuroticism is associated with maximizing decision style, matching the answer key's requirement.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

I would aim to make the course engaging by highlighting and explaining only the key concepts during class, allowing students to concentrate on truly understanding the essential content instead of having to sift through unnecessary information. Additionally, I would work to reduce their anxiety about exams so they don't see them as potential failures, which could lead to risky behaviors like cheating.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement with the question by providing concrete strategies for student engagement within resource constraints. They identify key pedagogical approaches (focusing on essential concepts, reducing exam anxiety) and connect these to practical outcomes (better understanding, reduced cheating). The answer shows thoughtful consideration of the teaching challenge presented.
