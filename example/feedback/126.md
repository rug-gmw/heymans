## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidtâ€™s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

The social intuitionist model proposes that our moral decisions are primarily driven by immediate gut reactions, which align with System 1. Afterwards, we attempt to logically justify these moral choices, relating to System 2. According to the model, System 1 plays the leading role.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 involves 'immediate gut reactions' which corresponds to intuitions/emotions in moral judgment.
- Correct: The student accurately describes System 2 as involving logical justification of moral choices, which aligns with reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student clearly states that 'System 1 plays the leading role,' correctly identifying that intuition/emotion is more dominant than reasoning in Haidt's model.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

This is called the representativeness heuristic. It involves judging a person's group affiliation by how closely they resemble other members of that group, while ignoring the actual likelihood of them being part of that group. This is known as base rate neglect.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive bias in this scenario.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that the representativeness heuristic involves judging group membership based on resemblance to group stereotypes. The additional mention of base rate neglect shows deeper understanding of the concept.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring occurs when new information is evaluated in relation to the first piece of information received. The primacy effect refers to the tendency for our judgments to be heavily shaped by the first information or value we encounter. In this effect, the initial information acts as a reference point or anchor.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as being related to using the first piece of information as a reference point, which aligns with the answer key's definition of taking the first piece of information as the starting point.
- Incorrect: The student describes the primacy effect as judgments being shaped by first information rather than memory retention. The answer key specifically defines primacy effect as the tendency to better remember the first piece of information.
- Correct: The student implicitly demonstrates understanding of the commonality by describing both concepts in terms of overreliance on first/initial information, though they don't explicitly state this shared characteristic.

Score: 0.6666666666666666

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion is the tendency for individuals to weigh losses more heavily than gains of the same amount. Risk aversion describes our preference to steer clear of risk, particularly when potential rewards are involved.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves weighing losses more heavily than gains of the same amount, which matches the answer key definition.
- Correct: The student correctly describes risk aversion as a preference to avoid risk, which aligns with the answer key's definition of preferring certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 1.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias is the tendency to exaggerate how strongly a future event will affect our emotions. This can cause a person to stay in an unhappy relationship because they believe the emotional pain of a breakup will be worse than it truly ends up being.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as the tendency to exaggerate how strongly a future event will affect emotions, which aligns with overestimating the impact of future events on future feelings.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that impact bias prevents breakups because people believe the emotional pain will be worse than it actually is, which matches overestimating how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting is the process of anticipating how future events will impact our emotions. People tend to be poor at accurately predicting their future feelings. This is significant in end-of-life choices, as decisions made well ahead of time based on expected emotions may not reflect how a person will truly feel later.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies affective forecasting as predictions about future emotional states, though they phrase it as 'anticipating how future events will impact our emotions' which covers the same concept.
- Correct: The student captures the key insight that people may make different decisions when healthy versus when actually facing illness, explaining that advance decisions may not reflect true future feelings.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

Prospect theory indicates that individuals tend to overvalue small probabilities. However, it distinguishes between low and extremely low probabilities, as the latter are frequently underestimated and perceived as having a 0% chance.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that prospect theory shows people overvalue/overestimate small/low probabilities, which matches the answer key point about merely low probabilities being overestimated.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that extremely low probabilities are underestimated and perceived as having 0% chance, which aligns with the answer key point about extremely low probabilities being interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion describes our inclination to perceive losses as more impactful and harmful than gains of the same value are beneficial.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion means losses are perceived as more impactful than equivalent gains, which directly corresponds to the answer key's point that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Unlike expected value theory, expected utility theory incorporates heuristics and biases, focusing on the subjective desirability of outcomes instead of purely rational long-term gains.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions subjective desirability vs rational gains but doesn't clearly distinguish that expected value theory deals only with financial values while expected utility theory deals with both financial and non-financial values.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected utility theory incorporates heuristics and biases (specifically mentioning risk aversion through 'subjective desirability') while expected value theory does not.

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesnâ€™t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected value theory is a normative approach that views individuals as rational decision-makers aiming to select options that maximize long-term benefits. Expected utility theory is similar but focuses on choosing the most preferred outcomes regardless of their long-term value. Multi-attribute utility theory (MAUT) considers that choices have multiple characteristics and evaluates the optimal option by weighing these attributes and their utility. Prospect theory is a descriptive model that incorporates cognitive shortcuts and biases into decision-making.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as a normative model and mentions rational decision-making, though they focus on 'long-term benefits' rather than financial outcomes with probabilities.
- Incorrect: The student misunderstands expected utility theory by saying it focuses on 'most preferred outcomes regardless of their long-term value' rather than explaining that it extends expected value theory to include subjective utility beyond just financial outcomes.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies MAUT as involving multiple attributes and mentions weighing these attributes and their utility, capturing the key concepts from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies prospect theory as a descriptive model that incorporates cognitive shortcuts and biases, which aligns with the answer key's mention of heuristics and biases.

Score: 0.75

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease peopleâ€™s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Individuals tend to take more risks when a situation is framed around potential losses instead of gains. Therefore, the tendency to avoid losses can lead people to be less cautious about risk.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion leads people to take more risks when facing potential losses, which decreases risk aversion and makes people less cautious about risk - this accurately captures the key concept that loss aversion can make people risk-seeking to avoid losses.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves forming a learned connection to either enhance or reduce a behavior. In classical conditioning, this connection is between a stimulus and a response, while in operant conditioning, it is between a behavior and its consequence, such as a reward or punishment.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as a form of learning that involves forming connections, which aligns with the concept of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as involving connections between stimulus and response, which corresponds to learning associations when things happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as connecting behavior with consequences like rewards or punishments, matching the answer key's description of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation is the mistaken belief that A causes B, while illusory correlation is the false impression that A and B frequently happen together.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly distinguishes between illusory causation (mistaken causal belief) and illusory correlation (false perception of variables occurring together/correlating), capturing the essential difference between incorrectly inferring causation versus incorrectly perceiving correlation.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to â€˜properlyâ€™ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

A schema refers to how the healthcare system operates, while a script describes how to act at a birthday party. The birthday party represents a particular, routine event, whereas the healthcare system involves more general information about society.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that understanding the healthcare system is a schema and provides appropriate reasoning that it involves general information/knowledge about how the system operates.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script and appropriately explains it as involving behavior in a particular, routine event situation.

Score: 1.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

They adopted a mechanical approach by concentrating on the actions themselves instead of the motives driving them.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies behaviorists as adopting a 'mechanical approach' rather than the physical stance from Dennett's framework. While they correctly note that behaviorists focused on observable actions rather than internal mental states, they fail to properly connect this to Dennett's specific terminology and don't mention the stimulus-response causation that characterizes the physical stance.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

They take a mechanical perspective because they concentrate on how the behavior functions.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the stance as 'mechanical perspective' when the correct answer is the design stance. While they correctly recognize that evolutionary psychologists focus on function, they misidentify which of Dennett's stances this corresponds to.

Score: 0.0

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Temporal sequence: A causes B if A consistently happens before B. Proximity in time and location: A causes B if A takes place near B both temporally and spatially. Resemblance between cause and effect: A causes B if B resembles A. Uniqueness or exclusivity: A causes B if B only follows when A happens. Correlation: A and B frequently appear together.

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies distinctness/specificity as 'uniqueness or exclusivity' and explains that B only follows when A happens, which matches the answer key concept.
- Incorrect: Student mentions 'temporal sequence' but does not capture the consistency heuristic, which requires that B always follows A, not just that A happens before B.
- Incorrect: Student does not mention plausibility or common sense as a heuristic for determining causation.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies 'proximity in time and location' which matches the contiguity in time and space heuristic from the answer key.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies 'resemblance between cause and effect' which matches the similarity in cause and effect heuristic from the answer key.

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

The first is the availability heuristic, where we tend to estimate how often something occurs based on how easily related information is recalled. The second is the negativity bias, which causes us to pay more attention to negative information than positive. These two phenomena interact because negative information is more frequently remembered, making it more accessible in our minds.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias and explains it as the tendency to pay more attention to negative information, which aligns with the answer key's definition of seeking out or placing more weight on negative information.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the availability heuristic and accurately explains it as estimating frequency based on ease of recall, which matches the answer key's definition of estimating frequency based on ease with which examples come to mind.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of how these biases interact by explaining that negative information is more frequently remembered and thus more accessible, which captures the essential mechanism described in the answer key where negativity bias increases examples that availability heuristic then uses for overestimation.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

The magical contagion effect pertains to the psychological aspect of our everyday understanding. While it appears illogical when viewed through the lens of physical and biological knowledge, within the psychological domain, it reflects a learned connection between objects and a disliked individual.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that magical contagion involves the inappropriate application of biological domain concepts (contagion) to the psychological/social domain, and recognizes that this creates an illogical connection that doesn't follow physical or biological principles but operates within psychological understanding.

Score: 1.0

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A delusional conspiracy theory is generally not accepted by society, while a non-delusional one is widely believed.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student only identifies the social acceptance criterion but misses the crucial requirement that a delusional conspiracy theory must also be an irrational belief. The answer key specifies both conditions must be met: irrational belief AND not commonly accepted.

Your answer:

Being male. Lacking intelligence. Experiencing neuroticism.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identified 'being male' as a factor, which matches 'being a man' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identified 'lacking intelligence' as a factor, which corresponds to 'having a low level of intelligence' from the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student mentioned 'experiencing neuroticism' which is not listed among the cognitive and personality factors in the answer key.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you donâ€™t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

The psychological mechanism is known as continued influence. It happens when we take in new information but remain subconsciously affected by earlier beliefsâ€”in this instance, the wrong answers we originally believed to be true.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the continued-influence effect as the psychological mechanism, which is explicitly mentioned in the answer key as an acceptable general term for this phenomenon. The explanation accurately describes how earlier incorrect information continues to influence understanding despite later correction.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

A bias where we tend to prefer things simply because they are familiar to us.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the mere exposure effect, describing it as preferring things because they are familiar, which matches the answer key's definition of the tendency to prefer familiar things.

Score: 1.0

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Yes, individuals exhibit reduced unrealistic optimism when experiencing depression.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that depression reduces unrealistic optimism, which aligns with the answer key's point that people with major depressive disorder are more accurate at predictions due to reduced overly optimistic tendencies.

Score: 1.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

As the reliability of sensory input diminishes, we depend increasingly on our prior expectations, leading us to perceive what we anticipate.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that decreased sensory reliability leads to increased reliance on prior expectations/beliefs, and accurately describes how this affects perception by making us perceive what we anticipate rather than what the sensory input might suggest.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You donâ€™t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other peopleâ€™s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

At the preconventional stage, individuals act morally to evade punishment and gain rewards. In the conventional stage, they take into account others' interests and adhere to rules or laws to maintain social order. At the postconventional stage, people possess a more profound moral insight and place moral principles above legal regulations.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the preconventional level as focusing on avoiding punishment and gaining rewards, which matches the answer key's description of obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as considering others' interests and adhering to rules/laws for social order, which aligns with the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly describes the postconventional level as having deeper moral insight and placing moral principles above legal regulations, which matches the answer key's focus on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

Causal models of past events reflect people's desire to understand the world and its occurrences coherently. We seek out cause-and-effect connections, which leads to hindsight bias by making us see an event as more foreseeable after it has happened.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that causal models involve understanding events coherently through cause-and-effect connections, which aligns with the answer key's definition of a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that causal models contribute to hindsight bias by making events seem more foreseeable after they occur, which matches the answer key's point about events seeming more inevitable than they were.

Score: 1.0

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Learning leads to hindsight bias because we incorporate our new understanding when evaluating previous choices, causing us to believe the result was more foreseeable than it truly was.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that learning contributes to hindsight bias by explaining that new knowledge gets incorporated when evaluating past events, making outcomes seem more predictable in retrospect. This captures the core concept that newly learned information cannot be avoided when estimating past likelihood judgments.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing involves aiming to select the absolute best choice, which is often linked to feelings of dissatisfaction. Satisficing, on the other hand, is an approach where individuals look for an option that meets acceptable criteria. Neuroticism is connected to the maximizing tendency.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as 'aiming to select the absolute best choice' which matches the answer key's definition of 'trying to make the best choice.'
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as 'an approach where individuals look for an option that meets acceptable criteria' which aligns with the answer key's 'making a good-enough choice.'
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that 'Neuroticism is connected to the maximizing tendency' which matches the answer key's statement that high neuroticism leads to adopting the maximizing decision style.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

To boost student engagement, the exam could be presented by emphasizing potential gains rather than losses, which may reduce students' tendency to take risks (such as not studying). Highlighting the benefits of achieving a high grade represents a gain-focused approach, whereas focusing on the negative outcomes of failing reflects a loss-focused perspective.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement by applying framing theory (gain vs. loss framing) to educational context, showing understanding of how presentation affects student behavior and motivation. The answer provides a concrete, theory-based approach to the challenge of promoting student engagement.
