## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidtâ€™s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

The social-intuitionist model suggests that moral judgments primarily arise from moral intuitions, which are emotional reactions. In this framework, system 1 is responsible for generating these moral intuitions, while system 2 handles moral reasoning, typically acting as a retrospective justification for the judgment. System 2 can also try to change the moral judgment through thoughtful reasoning and reflection, but this is not always successful, and system 1's influence may persist. Consequently, system 1 is considered the more dominant process in this model.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies System 1 as responsible for moral intuitions and emotional reactions, which aligns with the answer key's requirement that System 1 refers to intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student accurately describes System 2 as handling moral reasoning and thoughtful reflection, which matches the answer key's requirement that System 2 refers to reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student explicitly states that 'system 1 is considered the more dominant process in this model,' directly satisfying the answer key's requirement about System 1 dominance.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

This assumption stems from the representativeness heuristic, a cognitive shortcut where individuals assess the probability of an item belonging to a specific group by how closely it matches the characteristics of that group. When using this heuristic, people frequently overlook the actual frequency or prevalence of the category, a phenomenon known as base-rate neglect.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process in this scenario.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that the representativeness heuristic involves estimating probability based on how closely someone matches the characteristics/stereotype of a category, which aligns with the answer key's explanation about resembling stereotypes.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring refers to the tendency to rely heavily on the initial information we receive when forming impressions, making estimates, or holding beliefs. We then try to modify these beliefs based on new information, but this adjustment is typically inadequate, causing a bias toward the original anchor. The primacy effect highlights how the first information we encounter significantly influences our memory and the way we form impressions. Both anchoring and the primacy effect share the characteristic that initial information generally has a more powerful and enduring impact on our thoughts.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as relying heavily on initial information and using it as a starting point, which aligns with the answer key's definition of taking the first piece of information as the starting point.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as how first information significantly influences memory and impression formation, which matches the answer key's point about better remembering the first piece of information.
- Correct: The student clearly states that both concepts share the characteristic that initial information has a more powerful and enduring impact, which corresponds to the answer key's point about overreliance on the first piece of information.

Score: 1.0

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion means that we tend to place greater importance on losses compared to gains, essentially giving more weight to losses. This represents a bias in how we perceive value. Risk aversion, on the other hand, means we favor certainty rather than uncertainty, often overestimating small risks and steering clear of them. This reflects a bias in how we assess the likelihood of risks.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves placing greater importance on losses compared to gains and giving more weight to losses, which accurately captures the core concept from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly defines risk aversion as favoring certainty over uncertainty, which matches the answer key definition. The additional details about overestimating small risks are related but not incorrect.

Score: 1.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias in affective forecasting describes how individuals often exaggerate how much future events will affect their emotions. This can lead people to stay in unhappy relationships, believing that ending them will cause greater unhappiness than they are presently experiencing (and more than it truly would).

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as exaggerating how much future events will affect emotions, which matches the answer key's definition of overestimating the impact of future events on future feelings.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that impact bias prevents breakups because people believe ending the relationship will cause greater unhappiness than it actually would, which aligns with the answer key's point about overestimating how bad a breakup will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves how we anticipate the effects of future events on our emotional well-being, and we rely heavily on these expectations when making decisions. This concept is crucial in end-of-life choices because people often exaggerate how much future events will affect their feelings (impact bias), overestimate how long these emotions will last (emotional evanescence), and overlook other influences on their future emotional state (focalism). Therefore, decisions made about end-of-life care in the past may not accurately represent a person's current desires, as their actual mental state might differ from what they had predicted.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines affective forecasting as predictions about future emotional states, specifically mentioning anticipating effects of future events on emotional well-being.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of the key concept by explaining that past end-of-life decisions may not reflect current desires due to prediction errors, which aligns with the idea that healthy people's predictions about preferring death when sick may not match their actual preferences when sick.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

Prospect theory suggests that individuals tend to undervalue small probabilities, with a distinction between moderately low probabilities (such as 10%) and very tiny probabilities (like 0.01%): while low probabilities are underestimated, extremely low probabilities are perceived as impossible.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student states that low probabilities are underestimated, but according to prospect theory, merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) are actually overestimated, not underestimated.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that extremely low probabilities are perceived as impossible, which aligns with the answer key's point about them being interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 0.5

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

In prospect theory's utility framework, loss aversion means that small losses are given more importance than they objectively deserve, while large gains are given less importance than they actually have.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly describes loss aversion as being about 'small losses' vs 'large gains' and uses vague terms like 'objectively deserve.' Loss aversion actually means that losses are weighted more heavily than equivalent gains (i.e., the value function is steeper in the loss domain), regardless of magnitude.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

The primary distinctions between expected value theory and expected utility theory are that expected utility theory accounts for risk aversion and subjective non-monetary outcomes, while expected value theory does not.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected utility theory deals with subjective non-monetary outcomes while expected value theory does not, which aligns with the answer key point about financial vs non-financial values.
- Correct: The student correctly states that expected utility theory accounts for risk aversion while expected value theory does not, which matches the answer key point about considering heuristics and biases versus risk aversion.

Score: 1.0

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesnâ€™t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected value theory is a normative framework that determines the value of a financial outcome by multiplying it by its probability. It does not account for biases or heuristics and assumes individuals can perfectly calculate probabilities and have full information about values. Similarly, expected utility theory is a normative model that shares these assumptions but also incorporates subjective, non-financial outcomes and risk aversion, while still ignoring biases and heuristics. Multi-attribute utility theory is another normative approach that recognizes each option comprises multiple attributes, each assigned a weight and utility, providing a structured way to handle subjectivity. In contrast, prospect theory is a descriptive model related to expected utility theory and grounded in the behavioral life-cycle hypothesis. It takes into account biases and heuristics, especially loss aversion and risk aversion, based on the premise that people evaluate outcomes as losses or gains and exhibit biases when assessing utility and probabilities.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as a normative model involving financial outcomes and probabilities, though they provide more detail about assumptions than required.
- Correct: The student accurately describes expected utility theory as similar to expected value theory but incorporating subjective, non-financial outcomes and mentions risk aversion, which aligns with the utility concept.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies multi-attribute utility theory as a normative model involving multiple attributes with weights and utilities for each option.
- Correct: The student properly categorizes prospect theory as a descriptive/behavioral model that accounts for biases and heuristics, mentioning its relationship to expected utility theory and providing relevant examples like loss aversion.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease peopleâ€™s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Presenting information in terms of losses tends to make individuals more inclined to take risks: when faced with a possible loss, people may be more willing to take chances to avoid it. In other words, when the threat of losing is significant, the desire to avoid loss overrides the tendency to avoid risk.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion makes people more willing to take risks when facing potential losses, effectively explaining how loss aversion can override risk aversion and even make people risk-seeking to avoid losses.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves acquiring associations based on experience. Classical conditioning refers to learning connections between two events that occur together in time and place. Operant conditioning involves learning the relationship between behaviors and their consequences, meaning that specific actions can result in either rewards or punishments.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as learning associations through experience, which aligns with the answer key's description of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as learning connections between two events that occur together in time and place, which matches the answer key's explanation of associating things that happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning the relationship between behaviors and their consequences (rewards or punishments), which directly corresponds to the answer key's definition of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory correlation refers to a perceived connection between two variables that doesn't actually exist, while illusory causation involves a genuine correlation that is mistakenly interpreted as a cause-and-effect relationship.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly distinguishes that illusory correlation involves perceiving a connection/correlation that doesn't actually exist, while illusory causation involves misinterpreting a real correlation as causation. This accurately captures the key difference outlined in the answer key.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to â€˜properlyâ€™ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

Schema theory sees knowledge as connections between concepts. Essentially, a schema is a mental structure that aids in comprehending and making sense of a particular situation. A script is a type of social schema tailored to a specific social context and influenced by culture. For example, the regulations of the Dutch healthcare system represent a schema, while the expected behavior at a birthday party represents a script.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the Dutch healthcare system as a schema and provides accurate reasoning that it represents knowledge structures and connections between concepts, which aligns with the answer key's explanation of schemas as knowledge and relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies birthday party behavior as a script and accurately explains it as a type of social schema for specific social contexts influenced by culture, which matches the answer key's description of scripts as social schemas describing situation-specific behavior.

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

Behaviourists take a physical approach by examining the physical characteristics of stimuli and the body in order to comprehend behaviour.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that behaviorists adopted the physical stance and provides appropriate reasoning by explaining they examined physical characteristics of stimuli and the body to understand behavior, which aligns with the answer key's emphasis on focusing on processes that cause stimuli to result in behavior.

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

Evolutionary psychologists take a functional approach by examining the purpose or design of behavior to understand it.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that evolutionary psychologists adopt a functional approach by examining purpose/design of behavior, which aligns with the design stance that considers psychological processes in terms of their function.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

The five heuristics include: Consistency, where A reliably (or generally) leads to B; Distinctiveness or Specificity, meaning A specifically results in B rather than A causing C or C causing B; Similarity in causes and effects, where A and B share comparable traits or features; Plausibility, indicating it is reasonable to believe that A causes B; and Contiguity in space and time, where B occurs immediately after and near A.

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies distinctiveness/specificity and explains it as A specifically resulting in B rather than other causal relationships, which matches the answer key's explanation.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies consistency and explains it as A reliably or generally leading to B, which aligns with the answer key's requirement that B always follows A.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies plausibility and explains it as being reasonable to believe A causes B, which matches the answer key's common sense criterion.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies contiguity in space and time and explains it as B occurring immediately after and near A, which matches the answer key's same time and location requirement.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies similarity in causes and effects and explains it as A and B sharing comparable traits or features, which aligns with the answer key's superficial resemblance criterion.

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Negativity bias refers to our inclination to focus on negative emotional information. The availability heuristic is a cognitive shortcut where we judge the probability of an event based on how easily we can recall related examples. Combined, these two biases cause us to overestimate the number of people who are morally outraged on social media: we are drawn to morally shocking content (negativity bias), and because we frequently encounter it, we assume that more people are morally outraged than is true (availability heuristic).

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines negativity bias as our inclination to focus on negative emotional information, which aligns with the answer key's description of seeking out or placing more weight on negative information like morally outraged content.
- Correct: The student accurately defines the availability heuristic as judging probability based on how easily we can recall examples, which matches the answer key's definition of estimating frequency based on ease of recall.
- Correct: The student correctly explains the mechanism by which these biases work together: negativity bias draws us to morally shocking content, and frequent encounters with such content through availability heuristic leads us to overestimate moral outrage prevalence.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

Framework theories are general, intuitive ideas about how the world operates and can be found across various fields such as biology, physics, and psychology. When knowledge from one area is applied to another, it can lead to the emergence of superstitions. A particular kind of superstition, called magical contagion, involves the belief that two objects that were once linked maintain a connection even after being separated. This explains why some individuals avoid using items that previously belonged to someone they strongly dislike.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that magical contagion involves applying biological concepts (objects maintaining connection after contact) to social/psychological domains (avoiding items from disliked people), demonstrating understanding of cross-domain knowledge transfer in framework theories.

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

The distinction between a delusional conspiracy theory and a non-delusional one lies in the extent to which it is embraced and accepted by a significant number of people. In other words, it depends on its cultural acceptance. This acceptance is influenced by the existing beliefs held by members of a community. A delusional conspiracy theory lacks widespread belief or acceptance, while a non-delusional conspiracy theory is broadly recognized and accepted.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student only addresses the 'commonly accepted' criterion but completely omits the 'irrational belief' component. According to the answer key, a conspiracy theory is delusional when it is BOTH an irrational belief AND not commonly accepted. The student's answer focuses exclusively on cultural acceptance/widespread belief while ignoring the rationality aspect entirely.

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

Three cognitive and personality factors that promote conspiratorial thinking are perceiving patterns in random events, a predisposition to believe in paranormal phenomena (gullibility), and a preference for straightforward explanations of complex situations.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'perceiving patterns in random events' which matches 'seeing patterns in randomness' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student mentions 'predisposition to believe in paranormal phenomena' which directly corresponds to 'believing paranormal phenomena' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student identifies 'preference for straightforward explanations of complex situations' which aligns with 'believing in simple explanations for complex events' from the answer key.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you donâ€™t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Source amnesia refers to the tendency to lose track of the circumstances in which we acquired certain information. In this case, incorrect answers can hinder learning because we might forget that we encountered them as wrong, leading us to mistakenly believe they are correct later on.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies source amnesia as the key mechanism and accurately explains how it works in this context - forgetting that an answer was incorrect and later mistaking it for the correct answer. This directly matches the primary answer in the key.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

Politicians use the mere exposure effect by repeatedly saying the same things, making us more inclined to like or feel positively about the messages we hear often.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the mere exposure effect as the psychological mechanism and accurately explains that repeated exposure leads to increased liking or positive feelings toward the repeated messages.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Mentally healthy individuals tend to have positivity and optimism biases, meaning they view themselves favorably, emphasize positive aspects while minimizing negative ones, overrate their abilities, and underestimate the chances of negative events occurring. In contrast, people with major depressive disorder experience these biases less, so they do not underestimate the probability of adverse outcomes. As a result, their predictions are more accurate.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people with major depressive disorder are more accurate at predicting negative events because they lack the optimism bias that mentally healthy individuals have, which causes non-depressed people to underestimate the likelihood of bad outcomes.

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

When sensory information becomes less reliable, prior beliefs have a greater impact on perception, causing perception to align more closely with those prior beliefs.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when sensory information becomes less reliable, prior beliefs have greater influence on perception, which directly matches the key concept from the answer key.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You donâ€™t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other peopleâ€™s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

Kohlberg divides moral development into three stages: pre-conventional, conventional, and post-conventional. The pre-conventional stage centers on avoiding punishment and seeking rewards, driven mainly by self-interest and minimal reciprocity. The conventional stage emphasizes the importance of being perceived as good by others, adhering to social norms, rules, and authority. The post-conventional stage involves recognizing that moral values can sometimes conflict and prioritizing universal ethical principles.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the pre-conventional level as focusing on avoiding punishment and seeking rewards, which matches the answer key's description of obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as emphasizing being perceived as good by others and adhering to social norms, which aligns with the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the post-conventional level as involving universal ethical principles, which matches the answer key's description of focusing on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model of past events is a logically organized story that clarifies why an event occurred. When reflecting on past occurrences, we instinctively use causal models to understand them. This process can lead to hindsight bias by making the sequence of events appear clearer and more predictable in hindsight, causing us to think we anticipated the outcome from the start.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies a causal model as a logically organized story/narrative that explains how past events are related and why they occurred.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that causal models contribute to hindsight bias by making events appear more predictable and inevitable in retrospect than they actually were.

Score: 1.0

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Hindsight bias occurs when we think we predicted past events beforehand, despite not actually doing so. This bias is influenced by learning, as itâ€™s impossible to ignore new information when reevaluating how likely those past events seemed.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that learning contributes to hindsight bias by making it impossible to ignore new information when reevaluating past likelihood judgments. This directly matches the key concept that newly learned information cannot be avoided when estimating past likelihood judgments.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Individuals who use the satisficing decision style seek to make decisions that are adequate and feel most satisfied when they achieve this. Those with a maximizing decision style strive to make the optimal decision and feel best when they succeed in doing so. This approach is a type of perfectionism. Such individuals tend to experience more regret and dissatisfaction because they often doubt whether they chose the best option. People who score high in the personality trait of neuroticism are more inclined to adopt the maximizing decision style.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as striving to make the optimal decision, which aligns with 'trying to make the best choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as seeking decisions that are adequate, which corresponds to 'making a good-enough choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people high in neuroticism are more inclined to adopt the maximizing decision style, matching the answer key exactly.

Score: 1.0

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

To promote student engagement, I would implement nudges, which are gentle techniques that influence behavior. To save time on grading, I would use an AI model to evaluate exams and share the modelâ€™s results along with the grading criteria with students. This acts as a default rule nudge, making quick AI grading the standard choice, while more time-consuming options like exam review sessions remain available if requested but are not the default. Additionally, I would assign a task that requires students to apply what theyâ€™ve learned in the course, asking them to submit a timeline of their work and detail their individual roles. This creates a (semi-) social pressure nudge. Finally, I would develop an AI tool that allows students to ask questions and practice the material with feedback. To employ an availability nudge, I would place a link to this tool prominently at the beginning of the online course page and promote it during every lecture, ensuring it is easily noticed and accessible.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement with the question by providing a comprehensive approach that combines behavioral economics concepts (nudges) with practical solutions for large-scale teaching. They address both engagement and resource constraints through specific strategies: AI-assisted grading with transparency, collaborative assignments with accountability measures, and accessible AI tutoring tools. The answer shows understanding of course material (nudging theory) and thoughtful application to the pedagogical challenge posed.

Score: 1.0
