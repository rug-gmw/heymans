## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidtâ€™s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

The model suggests that our moral reasoning is largely rooted in intuition, closely tied to emotions, which corresponds to system 1 thinking. As a result, we primarily depend on system 1 when making moral judgments, turning to system 2 thinking only when we are uncertain about our feelings or when our emotions are not intense. Thus, system 1 predominates in this framework.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 thinking is rooted in intuition and closely tied to emotions, which aligns with the answer key's requirement that System 1 refers to intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student implicitly references System 2 thinking as what we turn to when uncertain or when emotions are not intense, which indicates understanding that System 2 involves reasoning/deliberation, though this could have been more explicitly stated.
- Correct: The student clearly states that 'system 1 predominates in this framework' and explains that we 'primarily depend on system 1 when making moral judgments,' which directly addresses that System 1 is more dominant than System 2.

Score: 1.0

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

The representativeness heuristic refers to our tendency to assume that something fits into a category because it closely resembles other items within that category.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive bias in this scenario.
- Correct: The student provides an accurate explanation of the representativeness heuristic, describing how we categorize based on resemblance to other items in a category, which aligns with the key concept of estimating likelihood based on stereotype similarity.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring describes the tendency to use the initial information as a benchmark for processing subsequent information. The primacy effect highlights how individuals are heavily influenced by the earliest information they encounter. Both concepts emphasize the importance placed on the first piece of information received.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as using initial information as a benchmark/starting point for processing subsequent information, which aligns with the answer key's definition.
- Incorrect: The student describes the primacy effect as being 'heavily influenced by' early information rather than specifically about 'better remembering' the first information, which misses the memory aspect that distinguishes it from anchoring.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both concepts share an emphasis on or overreliance on the first piece of information received.

Score: 0.6666666666666666

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency for people to perceive losses as more significant than equivalent gains. Risk aversion refers to the preference for avoiding risk whenever possible.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves perceiving losses as more significant than equivalent gains, which matches the answer key's description of weighing losses more heavily than gains.
- Correct: The student correctly captures that risk aversion involves preference for avoiding risk, which aligns with the answer key's description of preferring certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 1.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias refers to the tendency to overestimate the intensity and duration of our emotional reactions. This misconception can stop individuals from ending relationships, as they anticipate feeling far worse after a breakup than they actually would compared to remaining in the relationship.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as overestimating emotional reactions, which aligns with the answer key's definition of overestimating the impact of future events on feelings. The addition of 'duration' shows even deeper understanding.
- Correct: The student accurately explains how impact bias prevents breakups by describing that people anticipate feeling worse after a breakup than they actually would, which matches the answer key's point about overestimating how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting refers to how individuals predict the impact their emotions will have on them later on. This concept is significant in end-of-life choices because people often assume their present emotions will continue into the future, leading them, for instance, to think they would rather die than endure a prolonged illness.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies affective forecasting as predictions about future emotional states, though they phrase it as 'impact their emotions will have on them later on' rather than directly stating it's about predicting future emotional states.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of the key concept that healthy people may predict they would prefer death when ill, capturing the essence of how current emotional states bias predictions about future preferences in end-of-life scenarios.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

People tend to undervalue very small probabilities, especially when those probabilities are exceedingly low.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student states people 'undervalue very small probabilities' which contradicts the answer key that merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Incorrect: While the student mentions 'exceedingly low' probabilities, they say these are undervalued rather than treated as impossibilities as stated in the answer key.

Score: 0.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Individuals generally place greater importance on losses than on equivalent gains.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion means losses are weighted more heavily than equivalent gains, which captures the core concept that negative utilities have greater impact than positive utilities of the same magnitude.

Score: 1.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

In expected utility theory, outcomes are not limited to monetary values. Additionally, it considers risk aversion, unlike expected value theory.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected utility theory deals with non-monetary outcomes while expected value theory is limited to financial/monetary values.
- Correct: The student correctly states that expected utility theory considers risk aversion while expected value theory does not.

Score: 1.0

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesnâ€™t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected value theory is a framework for decision-making that focuses on monetary outcomes. Expected utility theory expands this approach to decisions where outcomes may not be solely financial. Multi-attribute utility theory considers outcomes with multiple utilities and corresponding weights. Prospect theory shares similarities with expected utility theory but additionally incorporates heuristics and biases into the decision process.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as focusing on monetary outcomes and describes it as a decision-making framework, which aligns with the normative model concept from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes expected utility theory as expanding beyond financial outcomes to include subjective utility, which matches the answer key's description.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that multi-attribute utility theory involves multiple utilities with corresponding weights, capturing the key elements from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes prospect theory as similar to expected utility theory but incorporating heuristics and biases, which matches the descriptive/behavioral nature mentioned in the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease peopleâ€™s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

When individuals think there's a possibility of losing something, they may become more cautious and avoid taking risks to prevent that loss.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that loss aversion makes people more risk averse and cautious. The answer key indicates that loss aversion actually decreases risk aversion and can make people risk-seeking when trying to avoid losses, which is the opposite of what the student described.

Score: 0.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning is a type of learning that relies on the association between events. Classical conditioning involves learning that two events occur together or that one event consistently follows another, while operant conditioning involves learning that a behavior is followed by either a reward or a punishment.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as a type of learning involving associations between events, which aligns with the answer key's definition of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as learning that two events occur together or one follows another, which matches the answer key's explanation of associating things that happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning that behavior is followed by reward or punishment, which corresponds to the answer key's definition of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation is the mistaken belief that two events occur together, even though they do not. Illusory correlation is the incorrect assumption that one event causes another, when it does not.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student has confused the definitions. They define illusory causation as mistakenly believing events occur together (which is actually illusory correlation), and define illusory correlation as incorrectly assuming causation (which is actually illusory causation). The definitions are completely reversed.

Score: 0.0

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to â€˜properlyâ€™ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

A schema helps to grasp the functioning of the Dutch healthcare system because it outlines a general guideline on how to act and what to anticipate in a given situation. In contrast, a script illustrates how to behave at a birthday party, as it provides rules for appropriate social conduct in a specific context.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the healthcare system as a schema but provides the wrong reasoning, describing it as 'guidelines on how to act' which is more characteristic of a script. The correct reasoning should focus on it being knowledge and relationships between concepts.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies birthday party behavior as a script and provides appropriate reasoning about it being rules for social conduct in a specific context, which aligns with the definition of a script as a social schema for specific situations.

Score: 0.5

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

The mechanical perspective explains the structure of something or the way it functions.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions 'mechanical perspective' which is not one of Dennett's stances, and doesn't identify the physical stance. Additionally, the answer doesn't connect behaviorism to focusing on stimulus-behavior processes or explain why behaviorists would adopt this particular stance.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

The design stance explains why something is constructed in a particular manner according to its purpose.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the design stance and provides an accurate definition that aligns with how evolutionary psychologists analyze psychological processes in terms of their adaptive function or purpose.

Score: 1.0

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

B should occur immediately following A. For consistency, B must always follow A. It is reasonable to believe that A causes or is linked to B. In terms of closeness in time and place, A should result in B rather than C. The event A should directly produce B, not another outcome.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student mentions 'A should result in B rather than C' which captures the essence of distinctness - that B follows A specifically and not other events.
- Correct: The student correctly states 'B must always follow A' which directly matches the consistency heuristic from the answer key.
- Correct: The student mentions 'It is reasonable to believe that A causes or is linked to B' which captures the plausibility heuristic requiring common sense support for causation.
- Correct: The student references 'closeness in time and place' and 'B should occur immediately following A' which addresses contiguity in time and space.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention similarity in cause and effect - the heuristic that A and B should superficially resemble each other.

Score: 0.8

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Tendency to focus more on negative information than positive.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the negativity bias as focusing more on negative information than positive, which aligns with the answer key's definition of seeking out or placing more weight on negative information.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention the availability heuristic, which is the second bias required by the answer key that causes us to estimate frequency based on ease of recall.
- Incorrect: The student does not explain how these two biases work together to cause overestimation of moral outrage on social media, missing the connection between negativity bias increasing examples and availability heuristic causing overestimation.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

According to framework theories, individuals gather information from various fields, amplify it, and combine it. In this case, people merge elements from the biological and psychological domains.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that framework theories involve combining information from different domains and specifically mentions the biological and psychological domains being merged, which aligns with the key concept of biological contagion being misapplied to social/psychological contexts.

Score: 1.0

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A conspiracy theory that is delusional is not embraced by the culture, while a non-delusional conspiracy theory can be commonly accepted and shared within the culture.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student only addresses the 'commonly accepted' criterion but fails to mention that delusional conspiracy theories must also be 'irrational beliefs.' The answer is incomplete as it misses the key distinction about irrationality.

Score: 0.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

As a man, depending on instinctive thinking and ignoring likelihoods.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'being a man' as one of the cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking, which matches the answer key.
- Correct: The phrase 'depending on instinctive thinking' aligns with 'having a low level of analytical thinking' from the answer key, as instinctive thinking is the opposite of analytical thinking.
- Incorrect: While 'ignoring likelihoods' relates to probabilistic reasoning, it doesn't clearly match any of the specific factors listed in the answer key such as seeing patterns in randomness or believing in simple explanations.

Score: 2.0

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you donâ€™t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Knowing something was going to happen after it has already occurred.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's answer describes hindsight bias or postdiction, which is unrelated to the question about how incorrect quiz answers can interfere with learning. The answer key requires explanation of source amnesia, proactive interference, or the continued-influence effect - none of which are addressed in this response.

Score: 0.0

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

By presenting their messages in a way that feels more relatable.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's answer about making messages 'more relatable' does not identify the specific psychological mechanism of mere exposure effect or illusory-truth effect that occurs through repetition and increases preference/belief through familiarity.

Score: 0.0

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Yes, individuals with major depressive disorder are more likely to expect negative events to occur to them and do so more frequently than those without the disorder.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that people with major depressive disorder are less accurate (more likely to expect negative events), when the answer key indicates they are actually more accurate due to reduced optimism bias compared to non-depressed individuals.

Score: 0.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

You begin to depend more on your existing beliefs, which then have a greater impact on how you perceive things.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when sensory information becomes less reliable, prior beliefs have a greater impact on perception, which directly matches the answer key's requirement that perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs under these conditions.

Score: 1.0

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You donâ€™t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other peopleâ€™s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

The pre-conventional level involves making moral decisions based on personal feelings of right and wrong. The conventional level involves shaping moral judgments according to how others perceive us. The post-conventional level is characterized by more sophisticated thinking, recognizing that moral issues can have multiple valid solutions.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes pre-conventional level as based on 'personal feelings of right and wrong' rather than the correct focus on avoiding punishment or gaining rewards.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that conventional level involves concern for others' perceptions, which aligns with the focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Incorrect: The student describes post-conventional level as recognizing multiple valid solutions rather than the correct focus on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

It explains how we incorporate various pieces of information to revise our evaluations following an event.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes a process of incorporating information and revising evaluations, but does not identify a causal model as a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Incorrect: The student mentions revising evaluations after events but does not explain how causal models make events seem more inevitable than they were, which is the key mechanism of hindsight bias.

Score: 0.0

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Once an event has taken place, we inevitably incorporate the information gained afterward and revise our earlier judgments accordingly.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that hindsight bias occurs because we cannot avoid incorporating newly learned information when estimating past judgments, which matches the key concept in the answer key about taking newly learned information into account when estimating past likelihood judgments.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

The maximizing decision style refers to a person's tendency to aim for the best or ideal choice. In contrast, the satisficing decision style involves settling for a decision that is adequate or good enough. Individuals who score high in the neuroticism personality trait are more likely to prefer the maximizing approach.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as aiming for the best or ideal choice, which aligns with the answer key's description of 'trying to make the best choice.'
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as settling for a decision that is adequate or good enough, which matches the answer key's definition of 'making a good-enough choice.'
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that individuals high in neuroticism are more likely to prefer the maximizing approach, which directly matches the answer key.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

Alternatively, you might consider employing peer assessment or utilizing an AI-based grading tool.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The answer is too brief and superficial. While peer assessment and AI grading are relevant suggestions, the response lacks depth, explanation of how these would promote active engagement, consideration of implementation challenges, or reflection on course concepts. It does not demonstrate serious engagement with the complex pedagogical question posed.
