## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidtâ€™s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

In this framework of moral judgment, system 1 thinking takes the primary role. According to Haidt's model, moral judgments stem from moral intuitions, which are generated by system 1. These intuitions arise through an automatic process influenced by emotions and past experiences. System 2's function is to provide rational thought that may make after-the-fact modifications to these intuitions, but it generally has a limited effect since intuitions are more influential in shaping moral judgments.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 thinking involves moral intuitions and emotions, mentioning that moral judgments stem from moral intuitions generated by System 1 and that these are influenced by emotions.
- Correct: The student accurately describes System 2 thinking as providing rational thought, specifically noting that System 2 provides 'rational thought that may make after-the-fact modifications' to intuitions.
- Correct: The student clearly states that System 1 is dominant, explaining that 'system 1 thinking takes the primary role' and that 'intuitions are more influential in shaping moral judgments' than System 2's rational processes.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

The representativeness heuristic refers to our tendency to classify people or things according to how closely they match the typical characteristics of a certain category or group. In doing so, we often overlook the actual rarity or frequency of that group, such as with fashion models; this oversight is known as base-rate neglect.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process in this scenario.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that the representativeness heuristic involves estimating likelihood based on how closely someone matches typical characteristics of a category, which aligns with the answer key's explanation about resembling stereotypes.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring involves holding tightly to the first piece of information you receive, which then shapes your beliefs or impressions, making it difficult to change them later on, and attempts to adjust are often ineffective. The primacy effect means that the initial information you encounter heavily impacts your impressions and beliefs, influencing the decisions you make. Both concepts share the idea that once an anchor is set or the primacy effect takes place, it becomes challenging to move beyond it, causing it to continually affect your decisions and perspectives. In both cases, the first information received has a disproportionate impact on how you view things.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as involving the first piece of information as a starting point that shapes beliefs and is difficult to change, which aligns with the answer key's definition.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as initial information heavily impacting impressions and beliefs, which corresponds to the answer key's emphasis on better remembering first information.
- Correct: The student clearly explains that both concepts involve disproportionate impact of first information and difficulty moving beyond it, which matches the answer key's point about overreliance on first information.

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency to feel the impact of losses more strongly than that of gains, whereas risk aversion describes the preference for certainty rather than taking chances.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves feeling losses more strongly than gains, which matches the answer key's description of weighing losses more heavily than gains.
- Correct: The student accurately describes risk aversion as preferring certainty rather than taking chances, which aligns with the answer key's definition of preferring certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 1.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias refers to the common tendency for people to exaggerate the extent to which specific choices will influence their future emotions. This bias can stop individuals from ending relationships because they believe the sadness following a breakup will be greater than it actually is. As a result, they remain in unhappy relationships due to overestimating the emotional pain of breaking up.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as the tendency to exaggerate how choices will influence future emotions, which aligns with the answer key's definition of overestimating the impact of future events on future feelings.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that impact bias prevents breakups because people overestimate how bad they will feel after breaking up, matching the answer key's explanation about overestimating the negative emotional impact.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves predicting your future emotions, and these predictions affect the choices you make. It is important to consider this when making end-of-life decisions, as it helps guide those decisions based on how you expect to feel in that circumstance. However, it's important to remember that affective forecasting can be influenced by biases such as focalism, emotional fading, and impact bias.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines affective forecasting as predicting future emotions, which aligns with the answer key definition of 'predictions about our own future emotional state.'
- Incorrect: While the student mentions that affective forecasting is important for end-of-life decisions and discusses biases, they do not address the key point that healthy people may predict preferring death when sick but actually prefer to live when they become sick.

Score: 0.5

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

In general, low probabilities tend to be overestimated. However, when it comes to extremely low probabilities, people often underestimate them and regard them as impossible. Therefore, there is a difference between moderately low probabilities (such as 10%) and extremely low probabilities (like 0.01%), with the former being overestimated and the latter underestimated or ignored.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that merely low probabilities (like 10%) are overestimated, which aligns with the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately states that extremely low probabilities are underestimated and regarded as impossible, which matches the answer key's point about them being interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

It represents a negative value because we tend to dislike losses more than we value gains. Since losses are unpleasant and we strive to avoid them, which requires effort, loss aversion carries a negative utility.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that loss aversion 'carries a negative utility' and focuses on losses being unpleasant rather than explaining that loss aversion reflects the asymmetry where negative utilities (losses) are weighted more heavily than positive utilities (gains) of equal magnitude.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory focuses solely on numerical amounts such as financial costs or benefits. In contrast, expected utility theory encompasses utilities, which may not be concrete numerical figures but rather subjective evaluations of value. Another key distinction is that in expected value theory, values are fixed and uniform for everyone, whereas expected utility theory deals with utilities that vary between individuals, making it subjective. Therefore, expected utility theory is subjective, while expected value theory is objective.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory focuses on numerical/financial amounts while expected utility theory deals with subjective evaluations of value, which aligns with the answer key's distinction between financial and non-financial values.
- Incorrect: The student discusses subjectivity and individual variation in utilities but does not mention risk aversion or heuristics and biases, which is the specific second point required by the answer key.

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesnâ€™t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected value theory is a normative method used to identify the optimal decision based on fixed numerical values, such as financial costs. Expected utility theory is also normative but focuses on making the best decision when options have varying utilities and probabilities; these utilities can be subjective rather than strictly numerical. Multi-attribute utility theory is a normative approach designed to select the best decision when multiple attributes have different utilities and weights. Prospect theory, which extends expected utility theory, incorporates biases and heuristics and serves as a descriptive model.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as a normative model dealing with fixed numerical values (financial outcomes) and mentions probabilities implicitly through the decision-making context.
- Correct: The student accurately describes expected utility theory as normative, mentions utilities and probabilities, and correctly notes that utilities can be subjective rather than strictly numerical/financial.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies multi-attribute utility theory as a normative model for decisions involving multiple attributes with different utilities and weights.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies prospect theory as descriptive (not normative), mentions it incorporates biases and heuristics, and notes its relationship to expected utility theory.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease peopleâ€™s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Individuals tend to place greater importance on losses than on gains, making them more inclined to respond to loss framing rather than gain framing. This loss framing encourages people to take more risks. Consequently, loss aversion influences whether individuals behave in a risk-averse or risk-seeking manner.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion can make people risk-seeking rather than risk-averse. They accurately explain that loss framing encourages risk-taking behavior and that loss aversion influences whether people are risk-averse or risk-seeking, which aligns with the key point that loss aversion can decrease risk aversion and make people risk seeking.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves learning through the association of events. Classical conditioning is the process of recognizing that specific signals or circumstances are connected, such as understanding that a bell signals mealtime. Operant conditioning involves learning that performing a particular behavior leads to either a reward or a punishment.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as learning through association of events, which aligns with the answer key's definition of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as recognizing connections between signals/circumstances, providing a clear example with the bell and mealtime that demonstrates understanding of temporal/spatial associations.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning that behaviors lead to rewards or punishments, which directly matches the answer key's definition.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation involves mistakenly believing that one event causes another when it does not. Illusory correlation refers to perceiving a connection between two events that do not actually occur together. Since causation and correlation are distinct concepts, this highlights the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that illusory causation involves mistakenly believing in a causal relationship where none exists, and illusory correlation involves perceiving a connection between events that don't actually occur together. While the phrasing differs from the answer key, the core distinction is accurately captured - illusory causation is about misinterpreting causation while illusory correlation is about perceiving non-existent correlations.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to â€˜properlyâ€™ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

A schema is a framework that explains how the healthcare system operates by showing the connections between different ideas, helping you understand how things function, such as the healthcare system. In contrast, a script is a type of social schema that outlines expected behaviors in typical scenarios. For example, a birthday party is a common event with usual social behaviors, so it is considered a script, whereas the healthcare system is less common and thus classified as a schema.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that understanding the Dutch healthcare system is a schema and provides appropriate reasoning that it involves connections between different ideas and explains how things function.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script and accurately explains that it is a type of social schema that outlines expected behaviors in typical scenarios.

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

The physical stance emphasizes the way things function physically, specifically how stimuli provoke behavior. This approach is more appropriate than the design stance or the intentional stance.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that behaviorists adopted the physical stance and provides an accurate explanation that this stance focuses on how stimuli physically provoke behavior, which aligns with the behaviorist emphasis on stimulus-response mechanisms rather than mental processes.

Score: 1.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

The intentional stance is used because it helps us grasp why evolution shaped humans as they are, offering the clearest understanding of evolutionary processes.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the intentional stance instead of the design stance. While they correctly recognize that evolutionary psychology focuses on understanding why evolution shaped humans and psychological processes, Dennett's design stance (not intentional stance) is the appropriate level of analysis when considering function and purpose in evolutionary terms.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

- Unique; whether event B happens exclusively when event A has occurred.  
- Related in cause and effect; whether the cause and its effect are connected (for example, kicking a ball causes the ball to move).  
- Adjacent in time and place; events A and B occur near each other both temporally and spatially.  
- Reasonable; there is a credible explanation for how A could lead to B.  
- Sequential order; event B consistently follows event A in a set order.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies distinctness/specificity with 'Unique; whether event B happens exclusively when event A has occurred,' which captures the core concept that B should follow A but not other events.
- Correct: The student identifies consistency with 'Sequential order; event B consistently follows event A in a set order,' which correctly captures that B should always follow A.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies plausibility with 'Reasonable; there is a credible explanation for how A could lead to B,' which matches the answer key's concept of common sense plausibility.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies contiguity with 'Adjacent in time and place; events A and B occur near each other both temporally and spatially,' which accurately captures the time and space proximity requirement.
- Incorrect: The student describes 'Related in cause and effect' as connection between cause and effect, but this doesn't match the answer key's 'similarity in cause and effect,' which refers to superficial resemblance between A and B, not their causal connection.

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

The negativity bias leads us to focus on negative information, causing us to look for moral outrage. The availability bias means moral outrage is more memorable and readily recalled, making it seem more common than it actually is. Together, these biases make us overestimate the number of people who are morally outraged.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias and explains that it leads us to focus on negative information and seek out moral outrage content.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies availability heuristic (calling it 'availability bias') and explains that it makes morally outraged content more memorable and readily recalled, leading to overestimation of frequency.
- Correct: The student successfully connects both biases, explaining how negativity bias increases attention to moral outrage content, which then through availability heuristic leads to overestimating how many people are morally outraged.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

Magical contagion is the belief that traits can be passed between people or objects through direct contact. This is a superstition, which arises from mistakenly applying knowledge from one area to a different context, leading to beliefs such as magical contagion.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that magical contagion involves the misapplication of knowledge from one domain to another context, which aligns with the answer key's point about incorrectly applying biological contagion concepts to social/psychological domains.

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A conspiracy is deemed delusional when it is clearly false and typically not widely accepted. In contrast, a non-delusional conspiracy may be true and is often more broadly believed.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly identifies that non-acceptance is a criterion for delusional conspiracy theories, but substitutes 'clearly false' for 'irrational belief' from the answer key. While related concepts, the answer key specifically requires the distinction between irrational belief versus rational belief, not simply true versus false.

Your answer:

- identifying as male - exhibiting narcissistic traits - having limited cognitive abilities

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'identifying as male' which corresponds to 'being a man' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'exhibiting narcissistic traits' which directly matches 'being narcissistic' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'having limited cognitive abilities' which corresponds to 'having a low level of intelligence' from the answer key.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you donâ€™t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

false information distortion

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The answer 'false information distortion' does not match any of the specific psychological mechanisms mentioned in the answer key (source amnesia, proactive interference, or continued-influence effect). While it suggests awareness that false information can cause problems, it lacks the precision and specific terminology required by the answer key.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

Repeating a message frequently makes it easier to remember because you can think of more instances of that statement, making it feel more familiar. People naturally tend to favor things they recognize, such as messages they hear often; this phenomenon is known as mere exposure. By repeatedly presenting their messages, they aim to increase your familiarity with them, hoping that you will come to prefer those statements.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies mere exposure as the psychological mechanism and accurately explains that it involves the tendency to prefer things that are familiar. The explanation demonstrates understanding of how repetition leads to familiarity, which then leads to preference.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

No, they exhibit little to no positivity bias. Positivity bias refers to the tendency of individuals to underestimate the probability of negative events occurring to them. Since people with major depressive disorder lack this bias or experience it to a minimal extent, they tend to have a more accurate perception of the likelihood of negative outcomes. Their assessments are more elevated but also more realistic, reflecting a more negative yet truthful worldview.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people with major depressive disorder are more accurate at predicting negative events due to reduced positivity bias (equivalent to reduced optimism bias mentioned in the answer key). The explanation demonstrates understanding that lack of positivity bias leads to more realistic assessments of negative outcomes.

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

As the trustworthiness of the information diminishes, you depend more on your pre-existing beliefs. Due to the reduced reliability of sensory input, you focus more on your initial expectations rather than the actual events. This makes it more probable that you perceive your expectations as aligning with reality. Consequently, prior beliefs and expectations become stronger and play a greater role in shaping perception.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when sensory information becomes less reliable, prior beliefs have increased influence on perception. They explain this through multiple complementary statements: depending more on pre-existing beliefs, focusing on initial expectations rather than actual events, and prior beliefs becoming stronger in shaping perception. This demonstrates a clear understanding of the core concept.

According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You donâ€™t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other peopleâ€™s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

- Pre-conventional: focusing on personal benefit, such as viewing something as good because it leads to a reward.  
- Conventional: considering the morals of others and being concerned with how others perceive your actions.  
- Post-conventional: recognizing universal moral principles and understanding that different moral perspectives may sometimes conflict.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the pre-conventional level as focusing on personal benefit and rewards, which aligns with the answer key's description of obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as considering others' morals and being concerned with others' perceptions, which matches the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the post-conventional level as recognizing universal moral principles, which aligns with the answer key's description of focusing on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

Causal models are mental constructs that link specific events or outcomes through cause-and-effect relationships. These models are formed only for outcomes that actually happened, not for those that did not occur. This tendency plays a role in hindsight bias because these causal models are readily recalled when reflecting on past decisions about likelihood. As a result, you tend to overrate how certain an outcome was and convince yourself that you predicted it beforehand, even though you did not. This phenomenon is known as hindsight.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that causal models are mental constructs that link events through cause-and-effect relationships, which aligns with the answer key's definition of a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student effectively explains how causal models contribute to hindsight bias by making outcomes seem more predictable in retrospect, leading to overconfidence in having predicted the outcome, which captures the essence of events seeming more inevitable than they actually were.

Score: 1.0

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

When remembering previous likelihood assessments, you also incorporate information gained after the event happened. This new knowledge influences your recollection of earlier likelihood judgments, even though you didn't have that information before. As a result, learning plays a role in hindsight bias. You come to believe you predicted the outcome because it seems logical in retrospect, but in truth, you did not anticipate it at the time.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly explains that newly learned information cannot be avoided when estimating past likelihood judgments, which is the core mechanism of how learning contributes to hindsight bias. The answer demonstrates understanding that post-event information influences recollection of prior judgments and explains the resulting bias effect.

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing involves striving to make the optimal choice, while satisficing means settling for decisions that are adequate rather than perfect. Individuals with high levels of neuroticism are more likely to use a maximizing decision-making approach.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as striving to make the optimal choice, which aligns with 'trying to make the best choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as settling for decisions that are adequate rather than perfect, which matches 'making a good-enough choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that individuals with high neuroticism are more likely to use a maximizing decision-making approach, which matches the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

When students receive little feedback, it can lead to cognitive fluency, where they believe they are skilled at a task based on experience, even if they haven't actually improved. This can occur when students take tests without any feedback; they may feel like they are making progress despite having incorrect answers. Therefore, providing some type of feedback, such as example answers, is important. These examples can be generated by AI to save time. It's not necessary to review every answer; offering a good example can help students gauge their improvement and prevent cognitive fluency.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement with the question by identifying a key psychological concept (cognitive fluency) and its relevance to student learning, proposing a practical solution (AI-generated example answers) that addresses the resource constraints mentioned in the question, and showing understanding of how feedback mechanisms can improve learning outcomes while being scalable for large classes.
