## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidtâ€™s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

System 1 makes a moral judgment automatically, while System 2 only engages afterward if there is a need to justify that judgment. System 1 is the more influential of the two.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 operates automatically in moral judgment, which aligns with the answer key's description of System 1 as intuitive/emotional processing.
- Correct: The student accurately describes System 2 as engaging afterward for justification purposes, which corresponds to the answer key's characterization of System 2 as reasoning/rational thought.
- Correct: The student correctly states that System 1 is more influential than System 2, matching the answer key's point about System 1 being dominant.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

The prototype heuristic leads us to identify a person or thing as a certain category if they closely match the typical example of that category.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the heuristic as the 'prototype heuristic' rather than the 'representativeness heuristic' as specified in the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly explains the underlying mechanism - estimating category membership based on how closely someone matches the typical example/stereotype of that category, which aligns with the explanation in the answer key.

Score: 0.5

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring refers to the tendency for an initial impression of a person or thing to act as a reference point, which is then modified but not enough to outweigh the original impression. The primacy effect means that information encountered first is often given more importance or remembered more clearly than information encountered afterward. While both concepts are alike in how they influence impressions, the primacy effect extends beyond impressions to include other areas such as learning.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as using initial information as a reference point, which aligns with the answer key's description of taking the first piece of information as the starting point.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as information encountered first being given more importance or remembered more clearly, which matches the answer key's definition of better remembering the first piece of information.
- Correct: The student recognizes that both concepts share a commonality in how they influence impressions based on first information, which corresponds to the answer key's point about overreliance on the first piece of information.

Score: 1.0

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers specifically to how people evaluate losses and gains, whereas risk aversion is more generally about our preference to avoid risk.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion relates to how people evaluate losses and gains, which captures the essence of weighing losses more heavily than gains.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that risk aversion is about preferring to avoid risk, which aligns with the preference for certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 1.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias refers to our tendency to overpredict how strongly events will affect our feelings. For example, we might believe a breakup will make us much sadder than it actually does, which can lead us to remain in an unhappy relationship.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as the tendency to overpredict how strongly events will affect our feelings, which matches the answer key's definition of overestimating the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly explains that impact bias prevents breakups by making people believe a breakup will make them much sadder than it actually does, leading them to stay in unhappy relationships. This directly addresses how overestimating negative feelings prevents the breakup action.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting refers to how individuals anticipate their future emotional responses. This concept is significant in end-of-life contexts because when people are healthy, they may believe they would prefer to die if they became seriously ill, yet when faced with severe illness, they might not wish to die. This discrepancy poses a challenging issue for doctors, particularly when dealing with patients suffering from dementia or related conditions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines affective forecasting as how individuals anticipate their future emotional responses, which aligns with the answer key's definition of predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Correct: The student accurately explains the importance in end-of-life decisions by describing how healthy people may predict preferring death when sick, but may not actually prefer to die when illness occurs, matching the answer key's core point.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

Very small probabilities are frequently ignored as impossible, whereas moderately low probabilities are often overvalued and perceived as more likely than they actually are.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that moderately low probabilities are overvalued/overestimated, which matches the answer key point about merely low probabilities being overestimated.
- Correct: The student accurately states that very small probabilities are ignored as impossible, which aligns with the answer key point about extremely low probabilities being interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

The displeasure experienced from losing something you have earned.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes loss aversion in general psychological terms rather than explaining how it is specifically reflected in utility terms within prospect theory. The answer key requires explaining that negative utilities are weighted more heavily than positive utilities or that the value function is steeper for losses than gains.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory focuses solely on financial aspects, whereas utility theory also considers non-financial factors. In expected utility theory, the mental effort required to save money is viewed as having a negative utility, while expected value theory treats it as purely positive.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory focuses on financial aspects while expected utility theory considers non-financial factors, which matches the first key point.
- Incorrect: The student discusses mental effort and negative utility but fails to mention risk aversion, which is the key concept from the answer key regarding heuristics and biases in expected utility theory.

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesnâ€™t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

The expected value model is a financial approach used to determine the best option. The expected utility model resembles the value model but also considers non-monetary factors when assigning value. The multi-attribute utility model is like the expected utility model but differs in structure and incorporates more complex attributes. Prospect theory builds on the expected utility model by including biases and heuristics in its analysis.

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies expected value as a financial approach for determining best options, which aligns with the normative model involving financial outcomes and probabilities.
- Correct: Student accurately explains expected utility as similar to expected value but incorporating non-monetary factors, which matches the key point about subjective utility beyond financial outcomes.
- Incorrect: Student mentions multi-attribute utility but fails to explain the key distinguishing features: multiple attributes each with their own utility and weight, instead giving a vague description about structure and complexity.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies prospect theory as building on expected utility theory by incorporating biases and heuristics, which aligns with it being a descriptive behavioral model.

Score: 0.75

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease peopleâ€™s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Individuals often place greater importance on losses than on gains, leading them to steer clear of scenarios where the potential for gains and losses is roughly equal, resulting in increased risk aversion.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that loss aversion leads to increased risk aversion. According to the answer key, loss aversion actually decreases risk aversion because people are willing to accept risk to avoid potential losses, potentially making them risk-seeking rather than risk-averse.

Score: 0.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves training someone to associate two events by consistently pairing them. Classical conditioning links two events that occur simultaneously in the same setting, whereas operant conditioning involves an action that is followed by a consequence, such as a reward or punishment.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as learning associations, though uses 'training' and 'pairing' rather than 'covariation' - the core concept is accurate.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as linking events that occur together in time and space ('simultaneously in the same setting').
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning through actions followed by consequences (rewards or punishments).

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation occurs when one event appears to cause another, but this is not true, whereas illusory correlation involves perceiving a relationship between two variables that does not actually exist.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly distinguishes between illusory causation (incorrectly perceiving causation when it doesn't exist) and illusory correlation (perceiving correlation between variables that don't actually correlate). While the wording differs from the answer key, the student demonstrates understanding that illusory causation involves false causal interpretation and illusory correlation involves false perception of relationship/correlation.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to â€˜properlyâ€™ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

A script is a framework for social scenarios, so understanding how to act at a birthday party is an example of a script, while knowing how the healthcare system operates is an example of a schema.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that understanding the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, though they provide a less detailed explanation than the answer key about it being knowledge and relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script and provides an accurate definition of scripts as frameworks for social scenarios.

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

A physical aspect. Only the actual physical actions performed are considered, excluding the design or intentions behind them.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that behaviorists adopted the physical stance and demonstrates understanding that this approach focuses only on observable physical actions while excluding mental states, intentions, or internal processes - which aligns with the behaviorist emphasis on stimulus-response relationships without considering unmeasurable mental phenomena.

Score: 1.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

A deliberate one. They consider the purpose driving our actions.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions considering 'purpose driving our actions' which relates to function, but they incorrectly identify the stance as 'deliberate' rather than the 'design stance' from Dennett's framework. The answer shows some understanding but uses incorrect terminology.

Score: 0.0

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Separate; A and B must occur simultaneously. Unchanging; A and B must consistently occur together. Reasonable; it must be logical that A leads to B. Adjacent in location and timing; A must happen immediately after B in the same place. Comparable in cause and outcome; the cause and effect between A and B should be alike.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions 'Separate' but doesn't clearly explain distinctness/specificity - that B follows A but not other events.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies consistency - that A and B must consistently occur together, matching the key point that B always follows A.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies plausibility as 'it must be logical that A leads to B', which matches the answer key's explanation of common sense plausibility.
- Incorrect: The student states 'A must happen immediately after B' which reverses the causal direction - it should be that A and B occur at the same time and place.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies similarity between cause and effect, stating 'the cause and effect between A and B should be alike', matching the answer key.

Score: 0.6

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

The negativity bias causes us to recall morally outraged content more clearly, and since typically only those who are morally outraged share posts on social media, the availability heuristic leads us to overestimate how common moral outrage is, especially when combined with the negativity bias.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias and explains its role in making morally outraged content more salient/memorable, which aligns with the answer key's description of seeking out or placing more weight on negative information.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies availability heuristic and explains how it leads to overestimation based on what comes to mind easily, which matches the answer key's definition of estimating frequency based on ease of recall.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of how these biases work together - negativity bias increases attention to outraged content, which through availability heuristic leads to overestimation, though they frame it slightly differently than the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

A framework theory is a general concept explaining how something functions. In this case, the framework suggests that individuals typically avoid interacting with those they dislike.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student answer does not identify the key concept of domain-inappropriate application of biological contagion principles to social/psychological contexts. The answer provides a general definition of framework theory but fails to explain how contagion concepts from the biological domain are being incorrectly applied to explain social preferences and avoidance behaviors.

Score: 0.0

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A conspiracy theory that is not delusional tends to be accepted by more people than one that is delusional.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student only addresses the 'commonly accepted' aspect but misses the crucial distinction that a delusional conspiracy theory must be both irrational AND not commonly accepted. The answer fails to mention irrationality as a key criterion.

Score: 0.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

Narcissistic characteristics, limited intelligence, and the presence of accounting expertise where it actually does not exist.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies narcissistic characteristics as a factor contributing to conspiratorial thinking, which matches 'being narcissistic' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student mentions 'limited intelligence' which corresponds to 'having a low level of intelligence' from the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student mentions 'accounting expertise where it actually does not exist' which appears to be a misremembering or confusion of the concept 'attributing agency where it does not exist' - accounting expertise is not mentioned in the answer key.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you donâ€™t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

People often forget where they heard, read, or saw information. As a result, they might recall the wrong answer and fail to realize it was incorrect during the exam.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies source amnesia as the mechanism - forgetting where information came from (that it was their own incorrect answer) and potentially recalling it as correct information. This matches the key concept from the answer key.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

They aim to establish their message as the standard way of thinking for people.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes a general goal of repetition but does not identify the specific psychological mechanism. The answer key requires naming 'mere exposure effect' or 'illusory-truth effect' - the psychological processes by which familiarity increases preference or perceived truthfulness.

Score: 0.0

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Healthy individuals tend to have a positivity bias, leading them to underestimate the chances of negative events occurring to them, whereas those with major depressive disorder may lack this bias, potentially making their perceptions more accurate or causing them to overestimate the likelihood of adverse events.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people with major depressive disorder are more accurate at making predictions about negative events because they lack the positivity bias that causes healthy individuals to underestimate risks. This aligns with the answer key's point about reduced overly optimistic tendencies in depression.

Score: 1.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

The impact of previous beliefs grows to help form a complete image.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that prior beliefs have increased influence when sensory information is unreliable, though the explanation is brief and uses informal language ('grows', 'complete image').

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You donâ€™t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other peopleâ€™s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

Pre-conventional reasoning focuses solely on self-interest. Conventional reasoning emphasizes doing what is considered right by others and following laws. Post-conventional reasoning recognizes that moral values can sometimes be in conflict.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that pre-conventional reasoning focuses on self-interest, which aligns with the answer key's description of avoiding punishment or gaining rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes conventional reasoning as emphasizing what others consider right and following laws, which matches the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Incorrect: While the student mentions moral values can be in conflict at the post-conventional level, they don't capture the key aspect of focusing on abstract principles and values as the basis for moral reasoning.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model explains how certain events lead to other events. It plays a role in hindsight bias when combined with the availability heuristic, as the actual sequence of events is easier to picture than all the possible scenarios that didnâ€™t occur, making the outcome appear more predictable.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a causal model explains how events lead to other events, which captures the essence of a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding that causal models contribute to hindsight bias by making outcomes appear more predictable/inevitable, though they explain the mechanism through availability heuristic rather than directly stating inevitability.

Score: 1.0

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

It is difficult to avoid considering the information gained during the event, which leads us to form different views about it.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that newly acquired information cannot be avoided when making retrospective judgments, which is the core mechanism of how learning contributes to hindsight bias. While not using the exact terminology from the answer key, the student demonstrates understanding of the concept.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

The maximizing decision style aims to select the best option available, whereas the satisfying decision style focuses on finding an option that is good enough. Since the maximizing decision style is associated with neuroticism, individuals with this trait are likely to adopt a maximizing approach to decision-making.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as aiming to select the best option available, which aligns with the answer key's definition of 'trying to make the best choice'.
- Correct: The student correctly describes the satisficing decision style as focusing on finding an option that is 'good enough', which matches the answer key's definition of 'making a good-enough choice'. Note: The student wrote 'satisfying' instead of 'satisficing' but the description is accurate.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that individuals high in neuroticism are likely to adopt a maximizing decision style, which matches the answer key's third point.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

There are several approaches. One is a default strategy, where putting in effort and actively participating in the material becomes the norm for students. Another is improving accessibility by ensuring the content is easy to access, which was effectively achieved through lecture slides, recordings, and practice questions with solutions. Lastly, peer pressure could be applied by showing which students attended lectures, reviewed the materials, or completed practice exams, although this method would likely be seen as unethical.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement by proposing three distinct approaches: establishing participation norms, improving accessibility through multiple content formats, and considering peer pressure mechanisms. The answer shows thoughtful consideration of practical implementation strategies and even acknowledges ethical concerns with one approach, indicating critical thinking about the question.
