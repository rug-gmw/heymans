# Exam grade and feedback for 9

Grade: 4.5

## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidtâ€™s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

The social-intuitionist model suggests that system 1 corresponds to intuition in moral reasoning, while system 2 represents the opposite, involving logical and analytical thought. Therefore, the model considers system 1 to be the primary driver.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 corresponds to intuition in moral reasoning.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies System 2 as involving logical and analytical thought, which aligns with reasoning/rational thought from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly states that System 1 is the primary driver, which matches that System 1 is more dominant according to the model.

Score: 1.0

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

This illustrates the representativeness heuristic, where we assess a person according to a stereotype, essentially assuming their appearance fits the typical image of a fashion model.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process in this scenario.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of the heuristic by explaining that it involves assessing people according to stereotypes and making judgments based on how well appearance fits typical images of a category.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring refers to information presented initially that influences impressions and serves as a reference point, although it can later be modified by additional information. The primacy effect means that the first thing mentioned often strongly affects the person and is challenging to alter. Both concepts share the idea that the first piece of information introduced has a powerful impact on impressions, which is not easily changed.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as the tendency to use initial information as a reference point that influences subsequent judgments, which aligns with the answer key's description of taking the first piece of information as the starting point.
- Incorrect: The student describes the primacy effect as having a strong impact that is hard to change, but misses the key aspect from the answer key that it specifically refers to better remembering the first piece of information.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both concepts involve the first piece of information having a powerful impact, which corresponds to the answer key's point about overreliance on the first piece of information.

Score: 0.6666666666666666

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency to take risks in order to prevent losses. In contrast, risk aversion involves avoiding risks because the potential gains do not outweigh the possible downsides.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly defines loss aversion as 'tendency to take risks to prevent losses' rather than the correct definition that losses are weighted more heavily than equivalent gains.
- Incorrect: The student describes risk aversion as a cost-benefit analysis of gains vs downsides rather than the correct definition of preferring certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 0.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

The impact bias refers to the tendency for individuals to anticipate intense emotional responses following important decisions with lasting consequences. This belief can discourage people from ending relationships, as they assume their feelings will be so overwhelming that staying together seems preferable, even though they might actually feel better after the breakup.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies impact bias as relating to anticipating intense emotional responses to future events, which captures the essence of overestimating the impact of future events on our feelings.
- Correct: The student accurately explains how impact bias prevents breakups by describing how people assume their feelings will be 'overwhelming' and that staying together seems preferable, which aligns with overestimating how bad a breakup will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves predicting future experiences based on present information. Regarding end-of-life choices, this plays a major role because individuals tend to support the option of ending their life when they are healthy but often oppose it when they are seriously ill and faced with the decision.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies affective forecasting as predicting future experiences, which aligns with the answer key's definition of predictions about future emotional states.
- Correct: The student accurately captures the key insight that healthy people may support ending life when sick, but actually sick people often oppose it when facing the real decision.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

According to prospect theory, people tend to view extremely low probabilities, such as 0.01%, as impossible and therefore underestimate them, while a probability like 10% is seen as more typical and may be overestimated.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that merely low probabilities (like 10%) are overestimated according to prospect theory.
- Correct: The student accurately states that extremely low probabilities (like 0.01%) are treated as impossibilities and underestimated, which aligns with the answer key's point about them being interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion suggests that significant losses are anticipated, and considerable risks must be accepted in order to reach a conclusion that yields a satisfactory level of utility.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's answer does not correctly explain loss aversion in terms of utility. The answer discusses anticipating losses and accepting risks, but fails to capture the key concept that loss aversion means negative utilities (losses) are weighted more heavily than positive utilities (gains) of the same magnitude, or that the value function is steeper for losses than gains.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory considers only monetary value, while expected utility theory takes into account factors beyond just monetary value.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory deals only with monetary/financial values while expected utility theory considers factors beyond monetary value, which aligns with the answer key point about financial vs non-financial values.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention the second key difference regarding heuristics/biases and risk aversion. Their answer only addresses one of the two main differences.

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesnâ€™t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected value theory (EVT) explains decision-making based on how we perceive the potential future monetary value of choices. Expected utility theory (EUT) is similar to EVT but focuses on the future utility of decisions rather than strictly monetary outcomes. The multiple-attribute theory resembles EUT but takes into account that each feature involved in making a decision consists of several attributes that need to be weighted. Prospect theory also addresses decision-making like the previous theories but further incorporates the influence of biases and heuristics.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies EVT as focusing on monetary value and probability-based outcomes, capturing the essence of expected value theory as a normative model for financial decision-making.
- Correct: The student accurately describes EUT as similar to EVT but extending beyond monetary outcomes to include subjective utility, which matches the key distinction in the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that multi-attribute utility theory involves multiple attributes that need to be weighted, capturing the core concept of this normative model with multiple weighted attributes.
- Correct: The student accurately describes prospect theory as incorporating biases and heuristics in decision-making, correctly identifying it as a descriptive/behavioral model that extends beyond basic expected utility theory.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease peopleâ€™s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Loss aversion causes individuals to be afraid of possible losses, which in turn leads them to engage in risks they might normally avoid, making them, in my view, more cautious about taking risks.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that loss aversion makes people 'more cautious about taking risks,' which contradicts the key point that loss aversion can actually decrease risk aversion and make people risk-seeking when trying to avoid losses.

Score: 0.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves learning through observing the outcomes and identifying causes. Classical conditioning refers to a cause-and-effect connection in behavior, while operant conditioning involves behaviors being influenced by rewards or punishments.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes conditioning as 'learning through observing outcomes and identifying causes' rather than 'learning associations through covariation.' While related, this misses the key concept of association learning.
- Incorrect: The student describes classical conditioning as 'cause-and-effect connection in behavior' which is incorrect. Classical conditioning is about learning associations when two things happen together in time and space, not cause-and-effect relationships.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that operant conditioning involves behaviors being influenced by rewards or punishments, which aligns with the answer key's description of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 0.3333333333333333

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

The difference is that causation implies a potential or assumed connection, while correlation indicates a clear and confirmed association.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student confuses basic causation vs correlation concepts rather than addressing the specific 'illusory' aspects. The answer doesn't explain that illusory causation involves misinterpreting real correlations as causal, while illusory correlation involves perceiving correlations that don't actually exist.

Score: 0.0

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to â€˜properlyâ€™ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

"How to behave properly at a birthday party" is a script because it provides a simple guideline on how to act based on previous experience. The Dutch health care system is a schema because it involves a specific process that people need to understand and follow.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that understanding the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, though their explanation focuses on 'process' rather than knowledge/relationships between concepts. The core identification is accurate.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that birthday party behavior is a script and provides a reasonable explanation about guidelines for action based on experience, which aligns with the concept of scripts as behavioral sequences for specific situations.

Score: 1.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

The behaviorist took the intentional stance by interpreting decision-making through the intentions behind the choices someone made.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the intentional stance, which focuses on beliefs, desires, and intentions. Behaviorists actually adopted the physical stance because they rejected mentalistic explanations and focused solely on observable stimulus-response relationships and the physical processes that cause stimuli to produce behaviors.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

An evolutionary psychologist would view this as a design perspective, since ingroup favoritism is structured to offer communities a protective advantage during emergencies.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance/perspective and provides appropriate reasoning that they consider psychological processes in terms of their function (specifically mentioning how ingroup favoritism is structured to offer protective advantages, which demonstrates understanding of functional analysis).

Score: 1.0

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Difference - my cat began purring as soon as I started scratching her. Cause and effect - my cat purrs immediately after I scratch her.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: Student does not mention distinctness/specificity heuristic. Only provides examples without identifying the heuristic.
- Incorrect: Student does not mention consistency heuristic. The examples given don't address whether B always follows A.
- Incorrect: Student does not mention plausibility heuristic or discuss common sense reasoning about causation.
- Incorrect: Student does not mention contiguity in time and space, though their example does implicitly involve temporal contiguity.
- Incorrect: Student does not mention similarity in cause and effect heuristic or provide relevant explanation.

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

The outcome bias and representativeness bias together might lead someone to view a behavior as irrational because they already know the outcome when they see the reaction. At the same time, this person might portray themselves as someone who exaggerates information to advance their own interests, which is where the representativeness bias becomes relevant.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies 'outcome bias' instead of 'negativity bias'. The negativity bias explains our tendency to focus on negative/outraged content, which is not addressed in the student's answer.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies 'representativeness bias' instead of 'availability heuristic'. The availability heuristic explains how easily recalled examples influence our frequency estimates, which is not explained in the student's response.
- Incorrect: The student fails to explain the correct mechanism of how negativity bias and availability heuristic work together to cause overestimation of moral outrage. Their explanation about outcome bias and representativeness bias does not address the core question.

Score: 0.0

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

Framework theories provide typical reasons for why people act in certain ways. As a result, choosing not to use the object may appear to the individual as the most reasonable option, reflecting an availability heuristic. Alternatively, this behavior could be viewed as a delusion, causing the person to genuinely believe that the item is cursed from their perspective. Others who do not share this belief might consider such thinking irrational.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student discusses availability heuristics, delusions, and rationality but completely misses the key concept from the answer key. They fail to identify that this is about the biological concept of contagion being incorrectly applied to the social/psychological domain, which is the core insight about framework theories and domain-specific knowledge.

Score: 0.0

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

The delusional conspiracy theory is irrational, while the non-delusional one can appear logical in some situations.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student only identifies irrationality as a distinguishing factor but misses the critical second criterion that the belief must also not be commonly accepted. The answer key requires both conditions (irrational AND not commonly accepted) to distinguish delusional from non-delusional conspiracy theories.

Score: 0.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

Delusions lead to conspirational thinking, irrational thoughts also fuel conspirational thinking, and occasionally, populist tendencies can promote conspirational thinking.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions 'delusions' but this doesn't clearly match any specific factor from the answer key. While delusions might relate to some cognitive biases, it's too vague and not a specific factor covered in the lecture.
- Incorrect: The student mentions 'irrational thoughts' which is too general and doesn't correspond to any specific cognitive or personality factor from the answer key such as pattern recognition in randomness or low analytical thinking.
- Incorrect: The student mentions 'populist tendencies' which is not listed among the cognitive and personality factors in the answer key. This appears to be a political concept rather than a cognitive or personality factor.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you donâ€™t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Outcome bias occurs when we evaluate results unfavorably because the outcomes are already known. When given the correct answers, you might underestimate your own performance, assuming the information was obvious, even though this is a natural part of learning.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes outcome bias and hindsight bias, but these don't explain how incorrect answers interfere with learning. The answer key requires explaining source amnesia (forgetting the incorrect answer was wrong) or proactive interference (initial wrong answers interfering with correct ones). The student's answer addresses a different psychological phenomenon entirely.

Score: 0.0

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

The confirmation bias plays a role in this, as repeatedly encountering the information makes it appear correct, leading people to believe that politicians are making the right decisions.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies confirmation bias as the mechanism. The correct answer is mere exposure effect (tendency to prefer familiar things) or illusory-truth effect (repeated information seems more true). Confirmation bias refers to seeking information that confirms existing beliefs, which is different from the psychological effect of repetition making messages more attractive or believable.

Score: 0.0

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Yes, they lack a positivity bias, so they tend to believe that negative events are more likely to occur.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly identifies that people with major depressive disorder lack positivity bias, but incorrectly concludes this makes them less accurate. The answer key indicates that reduced optimism bias actually makes them more accurate at predictions, not less accurate.

Score: 0.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

The perception shifts due to the reduced reliability.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The answer mentions that perception shifts due to reduced reliability but fails to specify the key point that prior beliefs have increased influence when sensory information becomes less reliable.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You donâ€™t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other peopleâ€™s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

The first stage, pre-conventional, involves morals guided by rewards and punishments. The second, conventional stage, is where morals are shaped by personal beliefs. Finally, the post-conventional stage is characterized by morals influenced by the environment and the perspectives of others.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that pre-conventional morality involves being guided by rewards and punishments, which matches the answer key's description of focusing on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Incorrect: The student describes conventional morality as being shaped by 'personal beliefs,' which is incorrect. The answer key specifies this level focuses on social norms and other people's feelings, not personal beliefs.
- Incorrect: The student describes post-conventional morality as being influenced by 'environment and perspectives of others,' which is incorrect. This description better fits conventional morality. The answer key indicates post-conventional morality focuses on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

The causal model assumes that events occurring together always happened together, essentially presuming a cause-and-effect connection. Hindsight bias plays a role by leading people to think that specific outcomes were predictable and unavoidable, thus implying a causal link.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes causal models as assuming events that occur together always happened together, which mischaracterizes them. A causal model is actually a coherent narrative explaining how past events are related, not an assumption about co-occurrence.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that hindsight bias makes outcomes seem predictable and unavoidable, which aligns with the key point that events in a causal model seem more inevitable than they actually were.

Score: 0.5

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

When acquiring new knowledge, it may appear obvious in retrospect, but without having received the information, hindsight bias wouldn't occur. You wouldn't perceive the result as having been obvious or unavoidable from the start.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that newly acquired knowledge makes outcomes appear obvious in retrospect, which aligns with the key concept that you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account when estimating past likelihood judgments.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing refers to the tendency to consistently choose the best possible option, while satisficing involves settling for a decision that is considered adequately good. Individuals with high levels of neuroticism are more likely to use a maximizing approach when making decisions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as choosing the best possible option, which aligns with the answer key's definition of 'trying to make the best choice.'
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as settling for a decision that is adequately good, which matches the answer key's definition of 'making a good-enough choice.'
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that individuals with high neuroticism are more likely to use a maximizing approach, which directly matches the answer key.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

To engage my students, I would incorporate content related to everyday decision-making to make the material more relevant and encourage greater interaction, helping them better understand their environment. For instance, by introducing various biases such as confirmation bias or hindsight bias, students would critically assess their decision-making processes and avoid relying solely on intuitive, System 1 thinking. This focus on improving biased decision-making would capture their attention and foster genuine engagement with the course material.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement by proposing a specific pedagogical approach that connects course material to students' personal experiences. They identify concrete psychological concepts (confirmation bias, hindsight bias, System 1 thinking) and explain how these would make the material more relevant and engaging. The answer shows thoughtful consideration of how to motivate student learning through practical applications.
