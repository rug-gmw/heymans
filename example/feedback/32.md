Grade: 7.5

## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

System 1 involves quick, automatic, and intuitive thinking, while System 2 is slower, more deliberate, and logical. According to Jonathan Haidt's social-intuitionist model, System 1 plays the more dominant role.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies System 1 as involving intuitive thinking, which aligns with the answer key's requirement that System 1 refers to intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies System 2 as slower, deliberate, and logical thinking, which corresponds to the answer key's requirement that System 2 refers to reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student explicitly states that System 1 plays the more dominant role according to Haidt's model, which directly matches the answer key's requirement about System 1 being more dominant.

Score: 1.0

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

Representativeness heuristic. This occurs because we ignore prior probabilities when making this decision. It is highly improbable that someone is both a fashion model and one of your classmates from the lectures.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive bias in this scenario.
- Incorrect: While the student mentions ignoring prior probabilities (which is related), they don't explain the core mechanism of the representativeness heuristic - that we judge likelihood based on how much someone resembles the stereotype of a category.

Score: 0.5

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring is the phenomenon where the initial information encountered serves as a reference point, and subsequent information is interpreted based on that reference. Primacy effect refers to the tendency for the first information seen to influence how later information is perceived. Both share the idea that the first thing experienced impacts the interpretation of what follows.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as using initial information as a reference point, which aligns with the answer key's description of taking the first piece of information as the starting point.
- Incorrect: The student describes primacy effect as influencing perception of later information, but the answer key specifically refers to better remembering the first piece of information, which is about memory retention rather than perception influence.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both phenomena involve the first information having disproportionate impact, which matches the answer key's point about overreliance on the first piece of information.

Score: 0.6666666666666666

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

When individuals are loss averse, they try to prevent losses, whereas when they are risk averse, they seek to steer clear of risks.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's explanation of loss aversion as 'trying to prevent losses' is too vague and doesn't capture the key concept that losses are weighted more heavily than equivalent gains. The answer misses the fundamental asymmetry between how we perceive losses versus gains.
- Incorrect: The student's definition of risk aversion as 'seeking to steer clear of risks' is imprecise and circular. It doesn't explain that risk aversion specifically refers to preferring certainty over uncertainty, and simply restates 'averse to risk' as 'steer clear of risks' without meaningful explanation.

Score: 0.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias is the tendency to exaggerate the emotional intensity of a decision. This can cause individuals to avoid ending an unhappy relationship because they overpredict how much emotional pain the breakup will cause.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student defines impact bias as exaggerating emotional intensity of a decision, but the correct definition is overestimating the impact of future events on our future feelings. The student's definition is too narrow and misses the key temporal aspect.
- Correct: The student correctly explains that impact bias prevents breakups because people overpredict/overestimate how much emotional pain the breakup will cause, which aligns with the answer key's point about overestimating how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Score: 0.5

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves making choices influenced by anticipated emotions. It is crucial to take this into account in end-of-life decisions because individuals in good health may feel more comfortable with the idea of ending their life than those experiencing severe health problems. Therefore, such decisions can vary depending on the circumstances and may change throughout different stages of life as emotions evolve.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that affective forecasting involves predictions about future emotional states, though they phrase it as 'making choices influenced by anticipated emotions' which captures the essence of predicting future emotional responses.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that healthy people may feel differently about end-of-life decisions when actually facing illness compared to when they are healthy, demonstrating understanding of how affective forecasting applies to end-of-life contexts.

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

We often exaggerate the likelihood of unlikely events, while we view extremely rare probabilities as impossible.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that unlikely events (low probabilities) are exaggerated, which aligns with the answer key point that merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Correct: The student accurately states that extremely rare probabilities are viewed as impossible, which directly matches the answer key point about extremely low probabilities being interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Individuals tend to value losses more intensely than they value equivalent gains. The negative impact of losses is stronger than the positive effect of gains.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion means losses are valued more intensely than equivalent gains, and that negative impacts are stronger than positive effects. This captures the core concept that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory focuses on financial results, while expected utility theory takes into account non-financial factors and attitudes toward risk.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory focuses on financial results while expected utility theory considers non-financial factors, which matches the first key point.
- Correct: The student correctly mentions that expected utility theory takes into account attitudes toward risk, which aligns with the second key point about risk aversion being considered in expected utility theory but not in expected value theory.

Score: 1.0

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected value theory models financial outcomes, while expected utility theory addresses non-financial outcomes and incorporates risk aversion. The expected multi-attribute utility model handles outcomes with varying utilities that are weighted differently. Prospect theory extends the expected multi-attribute utility theory by including heuristic and biased thinking, serving as a descriptive model.

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies expected value theory as dealing with financial outcomes, which aligns with the answer key's description of financial outcomes with probabilities.
- Correct: Student accurately describes expected utility theory as addressing non-financial outcomes and mentions risk aversion, which captures the key concept that outcomes have subjective utility beyond just financial value.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies the multi-attribute utility model as handling outcomes with varying utilities that are weighted differently, which matches the answer key's description of multiple attributes with utilities and weights.
- Incorrect: Student incorrectly states that prospect theory extends multi-attribute utility theory, when it actually extends expected utility theory. However, they correctly identify it as descriptive and mention heuristics and biases.

Score: 0.75

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

When individuals face a situation they see as a loss, they are more likely to take greater risks. Therefore, loss aversion leads people to engage in riskier behavior.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion leads people to take greater risks when facing potential losses, which aligns with the key point that loss aversion can decrease risk aversion and make people risk seeking.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning is the process of learning through forming associations. Classical conditioning involves learning by noticing the connection between two things occurring together. Operant conditioning involves learning through the use of rewards and punishments.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as learning through forming associations, which aligns with the answer key's definition of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as learning by noticing connections between two things occurring together, which matches the answer key's explanation of learning to associate things that happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning through rewards and punishments, which corresponds to the answer key's description of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation is the phenomenon where individuals mistakenly believe that one event causes another. Illusory correlation, on the other hand, involves incorrectly linking two unrelated things as being connected.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that illusory causation involves mistakenly believing one event causes another (causal interpretation) while illusory correlation involves incorrectly linking unrelated variables as connected (perceiving correlation where none exists). This captures the essential distinction between the two concepts.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

The example involving people's understanding of the Dutch healthcare system illustrates a schema. A schema provides a framework for comprehending situations, such as grasping how the Dutch healthcare system operates. Knowing the appropriate behavior at a birthday party is an example of a script, which is a type of schema related to a particular cultural context. It outlines how specific situations unfold and guides behavior within those contexts.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the Dutch healthcare system as a schema and provides an accurate explanation that it provides a framework for understanding how the system operates, which aligns with schemas being knowledge structures about relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies birthday party behavior as a script and explains that it guides behavior in specific situations and cultural contexts, which matches the answer key's description of scripts as social schemas for specific situational behavior.

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

Design stance refers to viewing the mind as unmeasurable and instead concentrating on eliciting behavior through stimuli, treating it as a cause-and-effect process and establishing connections between stimuli and observable actions.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the design stance instead of the physical stance. While they correctly describe behaviorist principles (focusing on unmeasurable mind, stimulus-response relationships, cause-and-effect), they misapply Dennett's stances. Behaviorists adopted the physical stance because they focused on mechanical, causal processes between stimuli and behaviors, not the design stance which involves understanding systems in terms of their intended functions or purposes.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

Organizational perspective, as it pertains to how individuals act.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student answer 'Organizational perspective, as it pertains to how individuals act' does not identify the design stance from Dennett's levels of analysis. The correct answer should recognize that evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance because they examine psychological processes in terms of their adaptive function and purpose in evolutionary terms.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Consistency occurs when A is regularly found alongside B. Specificity refers to the presence of a particular A with a particular B. Plausibility means that A can reasonably be considered a cause of B. Continuing over time and space means that A precedes B both temporally and spatially.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: Student mentions 'specificity' but doesn't capture the key concept that B follows A but not other events - the distinctness aspect is missing.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies consistency as A regularly occurring with B, which aligns with the concept that B always follows A.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies plausibility as A reasonably being considered a cause of B, matching the answer key's definition.
- Incorrect: Student describes temporal and spatial precedence but misses that contiguity means A and B occur at the same time and location, not that A precedes B.
- Incorrect: Student completely omits the fifth heuristic about similarity in cause and effect where A and B superficially resemble each other.

Score: 0.4

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

The negativity bias leads us to focus more on negative information and morally outraged posts on social media. Social media algorithms reinforce this by showing us more of that kind of content. Due to the availability bias, we then exaggerate how common morally outraged individuals are because such content is more readily recalled from frequent exposure online.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias and explains that it leads us to focus more on negative information and morally outraged content, which matches the answer key's definition.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies availability bias (referring to it as 'availability bias' rather than 'availability heuristic') and explains that frequent exposure makes examples more readily recalled, leading to overestimation of frequency, which aligns with the answer key.
- Correct: The student successfully connects how negativity bias increases exposure to morally outraged content, which through availability bias leads to overestimating how common moral outrage is, demonstrating the causal relationship described in the answer key.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

Framework theories provide a general understanding of how the world operates. If a particular framework theory fails to account for a specific area of knowledge, it is unreasonable to apply that theory to that area.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student provides a general definition of framework theories and states when they shouldn't be applied, but fails to identify the specific cross-domain application that explains magical contagion - namely that biological contagion concepts are being incorrectly applied to social/psychological domains.

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A delusional conspiracy theory is one that conflicts with the particular culture of the group that believes in it. In contrast, a non-delusional conspiracy theory aligns with the culture of its believers. What is considered delusional in one setting may be seen as non-delusional in a different context.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student focuses on cultural alignment rather than the key distinction in the answer key. The answer key specifies that delusional conspiracy theories are both irrational beliefs AND not commonly accepted, while the student's answer emphasizes cultural context and relativity without addressing the irrationality criterion or the concept of common acceptance.

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

Perceiving a connection where there is none, existing as a human, possessing limited intelligence.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'perceiving a connection where there is none' which corresponds to 'seeing patterns in randomness' from the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student mentions 'existing as a human' which is too vague and doesn't specifically match 'being a man' from the answer key, as it applies to all humans rather than identifying gender as a specific factor.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'possessing limited intelligence' which matches 'having a low level of intelligence' from the answer key.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

As a form of punishment, this learning method can be viewed as operant conditioning. Correct answers act as rewards, while incorrect answers serve as punishments. By steering clear of the punishments (wrong answers) and aiming for the rewards (right answers), you will learn to respond correctly.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies operant conditioning as the mechanism by which incorrect answers interfere with learning. The answer key requires discussion of source amnesia (forgetting that an incorrect answer was wrong), proactive interference (initial incorrect answers interfering with correct ones), or the continued-influence effect. The student's response describes how operant conditioning can facilitate learning through rewards and punishments, but does not address how incorrect answers can actually interfere with or hinder learning.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

Simple familiarity

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the core concept of mere exposure effect, which is based on familiarity with repeated stimuli making them more attractive or preferred.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Certainly.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student provided no substantive answer to the question about whether major depressive disorder affects accuracy in predicting negative events. The response 'Certainly' does not address the key point that people with depression are more accurate due to reduced optimism bias.

Score: 0.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

Individuals depend more on their existing beliefs than on the sensory data they receive. As a result, prior beliefs have a greater impact than sensory input. What you perceive is shaped more by those prior beliefs than by the actual sensory information entering your senses.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when sensory information becomes less reliable, prior beliefs have greater influence on perception. They accurately describe that perception becomes more dependent on expectations/existing beliefs rather than sensory input, which matches the core concept from the answer key.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

Pre-conventional stage: Your behavior is guided by avoiding punishment and seeking rewards. Conventional stage: You behave according to what is considered right to maintain social order. For instance, you avoid crossing the street at a red light because you are concerned about how others perceive you. Post-conventional stage: Your actions are based on your own moral principles, regardless of whether others are watching. For example, you would never cross at a red light because you believe it is inherently wrong, even if no one is around to see you.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the pre-conventional level as being guided by avoiding punishment and seeking rewards, which matches the answer key's focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as behaving according to what is considered right to maintain social order and concern about others' perceptions, which aligns with the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly describes the post-conventional level as actions based on one's own moral principles regardless of external observation, which matches the answer key's focus on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

The causal model of past events involves viewing event A as the reason for event B. This leads to hindsight bias because, when reflecting on the events, you feel like you always knew how one caused the other.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a causal model involves connecting events in a cause-and-effect relationship (A causes B), which captures the essence of creating a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student accurately explains how causal models contribute to hindsight bias by making people feel they 'always knew' the causal connection, which reflects the concept that events seem more inevitable in retrospect than they actually were.

Score: 1.0

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Once we know the real outcome of a situation, we often overrate the likelihood of that outcome occurring. Even if we were unaware of the result beforehand, we tend to believe that we had predicted it all along after learning what actually happened.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly explains that learning new information (the actual outcome) influences how we retrospectively assess probabilities, which is the core mechanism of hindsight bias described in the answer key. The student demonstrates understanding that newly acquired knowledge affects our ability to accurately recall or estimate past likelihood judgments.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing decision style involves selecting the absolute best choice, while the satisficing decision style means picking an option that is good enough or most suitable. Individuals who score high in neuroticism tend to use the maximizing decision style, as high neuroticism is associated with perfectionist tendencies.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as selecting the absolute best choice, which aligns with the answer key's description of 'trying to make the best choice.'
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as picking an option that is 'good enough,' which matches the answer key's definition of 'making a good-enough choice.'
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that individuals high in neuroticism tend to use the maximizing decision style and provides relevant reasoning about perfectionist tendencies associated with neuroticism.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

I would divide the course into theoretical and practical sessions. The lectures would cover the theories and literature, providing students with the necessary knowledge to succeed in the practical exercises. During practicals, students work together under the guidance of a supervisor, which creates a sense of accountability and motivation to perform well both because of the supervisor's presence and the desire to do well in front of peers. Regular, active participation in practicals each week helps reinforce and solidify their understanding of the theories and literature.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement by proposing a concrete pedagogical approach that addresses the constraint of limited resources. The answer shows understanding of active learning principles through practical sessions, peer interaction, and regular participation, while acknowledging the need for efficient supervision methods that don't require intensive individual grading.
