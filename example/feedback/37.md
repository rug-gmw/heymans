## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

In this model, system 1 is considered the primary driver because the social-intuitionist model suggests that moral judgments arise from intuition, which is a key characteristic of system 1 thinking. System 2 thinking, on the other hand, either serves to reflect on the moral judgments initially formed by system 1's intuitive process or to generate spontaneous justifications for those intuitions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 is associated with intuition, which aligns with the answer key's requirement that System 1 refers to intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student implicitly identifies System 2 with reasoning by describing it as serving to 'reflect on' and 'generate justifications,' which corresponds to the rational/deliberative function specified in the answer key.
- Correct: The student clearly states that 'system 1 is considered the primary driver' and explains that moral judgments arise from intuition, demonstrating understanding that System 1 is more dominant than System 2.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

This is known as the representativeness heuristic. It explains that we estimate the likelihood of an event by how closely it matches our mental image of a typical example from that category. Here, we assess our colleague by comparing them to our internal idea of a fashion model, and if they align, we categorize and judge them accordingly.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process in this scenario.
- Correct: The student provides an accurate explanation of the representativeness heuristic, describing how we estimate likelihood based on similarity to stereotypes or typical examples, and correctly applies this to the fashion model example.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring refers to the first characteristics we notice about someone, which then serve as a reference point for interpreting later information and shaping our beliefs. The primacy effect describes our tendency to give greater importance to the initial information or traits we acquire about a person when forming an opinion. Both concepts rely on early impressions or understandings, with the primacy effect also affecting how we establish our anchors.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes anchoring specifically in terms of person perception and characteristics, but the answer key defines anchoring more broadly as taking the first piece of information as a starting point, not limited to interpersonal contexts.
- Incorrect: The student describes the primacy effect as giving greater importance to initial information rather than better remembering it. The answer key specifically emphasizes memory - the tendency to better remember first information.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both concepts involve relying on early/initial information, which aligns with the answer key's point about overreliance on first information.

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to our inclination to avoid losing, while risk aversion is our preference to steer clear of taking risks. The main distinction is that loss aversion is directly related to whether we perceive an outcome as unfavorable, whereas risk aversion reflects our general reluctance to engage in risks we consider unnecessary.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes loss aversion as 'inclination to avoid losing' but misses the key concept that losses are weighted more heavily than equivalent gains. The answer doesn't capture the asymmetric valuation between losses and gains that defines loss aversion.
- Incorrect: The student describes risk aversion as 'reluctance to engage in risks we consider unnecessary' but fails to identify the core concept of preferring certainty over uncertainty. The answer focuses on 'unnecessary risks' rather than the fundamental preference for certain outcomes over uncertain ones.

Score: 0.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

1. Impact bias refers to our habit of exaggerating the extent and intensity of how an event will affect us, while downplaying the influence of other factors in the same situation. 2. This bias can stop individuals from leaving unhappy relationships because they overpredict the emotional pain of leaving and undervalue the positive aspects, like enjoying freedom or pursuing personal interests, that come with ending the relationship.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as overestimating the extent and intensity of how future events will affect us, which aligns with the key point about overestimating the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that impact bias prevents breakups by causing people to overpredict the emotional pain of leaving, which matches the answer key's point about overestimating how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting refers to our capacity to predict how future events will influence our emotions and the strength of those feelings. It is crucial in end-of-life choices because we may end up regretting health decisions once the outcomes become real.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines affective forecasting as predicting future emotional states and feelings, which aligns with the answer key's definition of 'predictions about our own future emotional state.'
- Correct: The student captures the essence of why affective forecasting matters in end-of-life decisions by noting that decisions made now may lead to regret when outcomes become real, which reflects the key concept that healthy people's predictions about preferring death may not match their actual preferences when sick.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

1. According to prospect theory, individuals often undervalue small probabilities. 2. It does not, because prospect theory suggests we essentially perceive that 10% chance as zero, and the same applies to 0.01%.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that individuals undervalue small probabilities, when prospect theory actually shows that merely low probabilities (like 10%) are typically overestimated, not undervalued.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly claims there is no difference between merely low and extremely low probabilities, stating both are perceived as zero. However, prospect theory distinguishes between these - merely low probabilities are overestimated while extremely low probabilities are treated as impossibilities.

Score: 0.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion influences how we assess the value of various options. When we are loss-averse, we often become more willing to take risks, which affects how we evaluate and prioritize different possibilities.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes behavioral effects of loss aversion but fails to explain what loss aversion reflects in terms of utility in prospect theory - that negative utilities are weighted more heavily than positive utilities or that the value function is steeper for losses than gains.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

1. Expected utility theory is specifically applied to determine the value of financial decisions. 2. Expected utility theory calculates the expected utility of a decision, where utility is a flexible concept that can represent any value you consider meaningful.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that expected utility theory is specifically for financial decisions, when the answer key indicates it's expected value theory that deals only with financial values, while expected utility theory deals with both financial and non-financial values.
- Incorrect: The student focuses on utility being a flexible concept but fails to address the key difference regarding risk aversion and heuristics/biases that distinguishes expected utility theory from expected value theory.

Score: 0.0

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected value theory is a model that helps determine the optimal choice by identifying the option with the greatest value. Expected utility theory is a model used to find the best option based on the highest utility. Multi-attribute utility theory is a model that considers multiple attributes, each given different weights, to guide decision-making. Robust satisficing involves selecting an option that will be "good enough" even in the worst-case situation.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as a model for determining optimal choice based on greatest value, though they don't mention the probabilistic nature or financial outcomes specifically.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected utility theory as finding the best option based on highest utility, though they don't explain how it differs from expected value theory or mention subjective outcomes.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies multi-attribute utility theory as considering multiple attributes with different weights for decision-making.
- Incorrect: The student describes 'robust satisficing' instead of prospect theory. Robust satisficing is not one of the four models from the answer key, and they completely missed prospect theory as a descriptive behavioral model.

Score: 0.75

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

It leads individuals to take more risks and become less cautious.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion can lead people to take more risks and become less cautious, which aligns with the key point that loss aversion decreases risk aversion and can make people risk-seeking when trying to avoid losses.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning occurs when a person is trained to respond in a certain way to a neutral stimulus through a learning process. Essentially, it involves the mind associating two separate and unrelated events. The distinction between classical and operant conditioning is that in operant conditioning, a stimulus that is not the original conditioned stimulus but is related to it can also evoke a conditioned response. For instance, when Little Albert develops a fear of fluffy white rats and then also exhibits fear toward a human male’s fluffy white beard.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as a learning process involving associations between events, which aligns with the answer key's definition of learning associations through covariation.
- Incorrect: The student does not accurately describe classical conditioning. They mention neutral stimuli and associations but don't explain the key concept of temporal and spatial covariation between two events.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly describes operant conditioning as stimulus generalization rather than learning that actions cause rewards or punishments. The Little Albert example describes generalization in classical conditioning, not operant conditioning.

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation occurs when we mistakenly believe that one thing causes another when it does not. Illusory correlation happens when we perceive a relationship between two things that, in reality, do not have any connection.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly distinguishes between illusory causation (mistakenly believing one thing causes another when it doesn't) and illusory correlation (perceiving a relationship between unconnected variables). While the wording differs from the answer key, the core concepts are accurately captured - illusory causation involves incorrect causal interpretation while illusory correlation involves perceiving non-existent relationships.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

The Dutch healthcare system is an example of a schema, while appropriate conduct at a birthday party represents a script. A schema consists of underlying knowledge and expectations about a particular area (such as the Dutch healthcare system), whereas a script is a detailed type of schema that applies to frequently recurring events.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the Dutch healthcare system as a schema and provides an accurate explanation that schemas consist of underlying knowledge and expectations about a particular area.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies birthday party behavior as a script and provides a good explanation that scripts are detailed schemas for frequently recurring events, which aligns with the concept of behavioral expectations for specific situations.

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

Behaviorists are considered to have taken a mechanical or design perspective, choosing to explain human behavior through biological design or physical mechanics. These viewpoints help explain the reasons behind our physical makeup and certain actions. However, behaviorists reject the intentional (psychological) perspective because they believe mental processes cannot be directly observed.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies behaviorists as adopting a 'mechanical or design perspective' rather than the physical stance. While they correctly note that behaviorists rejected mental processes as unobservable, they misunderstand Dennett's levels of analysis. Behaviorists focused on stimulus-response relationships as physical processes, which corresponds to the physical stance, not the design stance.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

Evolutionary psychologists tend to adopt a design (biological) perspective when interpreting behavior, as they believe our actions are shaped by evolutionary adaptations.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance and provides appropriate reasoning that they view behaviors as shaped by evolutionary adaptations, which aligns with considering psychological processes in terms of their function.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

We examine consistency (whether the event occurs repeatedly), consensus (if others also notice or experience it), covariation (if the events frequently occur together), temporal order (the sequence in which the events take place), and distinctiveness (whether B happens exclusively when A occurs). In this scenario, we would check if A always leads to B, if others observe the same pattern, if A and B usually happen simultaneously, if A precedes B, and if B only occurs when A happens beforehand.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student mentions 'distinctiveness' and explains it as 'whether B happens exclusively when A occurs' and 'if B only occurs when A happens beforehand', which captures the essence of distinctness/specificity from the answer key.
- Correct: The student mentions 'consistency' and explains it as 'whether the event occurs repeatedly' and 'if A always leads to B', which correctly identifies that B should always follow A.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention plausibility or common sense reasoning as a heuristic for determining causation.
- Incorrect: While the student mentions 'temporal order' and 'covariation', they don't address the spatial contiguity aspect (same location) that is part of the contiguity heuristic in the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention similarity in cause and effect as a heuristic for determining causation.

Score: 0.4

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

When we are frequently exposed to moral outrage, our memories related to it become more accessible. As a result of this increased availability, when we encounter more instances of moral outrage, we are quick to assume that moral outrage is widespread. Due to confirmation bias, we then actively look for evidence supporting this belief, causing us to initially think there is a lot of moral outrage and subsequently reinforce that idea each time we observe additional examples.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student does not explicitly mention the negativity bias. While they discuss exposure to moral outrage, they don't identify that we have a specific tendency to seek out or place more weight on negative information like morally outraged content.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the availability heuristic concept by explaining that increased accessibility of memories related to moral outrage leads us to assume it's widespread, which aligns with estimating frequency based on ease of recall.
- Incorrect: The student mentions confirmation bias rather than explaining how negativity bias and availability heuristic work together. They don't connect how negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage which then feeds into the availability heuristic to cause overestimation.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

Magical contagion happens when we transfer our existing knowledge and assumptions from one area to another. Here, we take what we know about biology—such as how bacteria, dirt, or illness can be transmitted between living creatures—and apply that understanding to objects previously handled by someone we dislike.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that biological contagion concepts (bacteria, dirt, illness transmission) are being inappropriately applied to the social/psychological domain of disliking someone's belongings, which matches the answer key's requirement about incorrectly applying biological domain concepts to the social domain.

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A delusional conspiracy theory is not accepted by the culture. In contrast, a non-delusional conspiracy theory includes elements that a broader group within the culture might find possible or plausible.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student only addresses the 'commonly accepted' criterion but completely omits the 'irrational belief' component. The answer key requires both conditions: being an irrational belief AND not commonly accepted. The student's answer is incomplete as it fails to mention irrationality as a distinguishing factor.

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

1. Individuals without a college degree 2. Individuals prone to paranoia 3. Individuals with high levels of narcissism.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: While education level may correlate with some cognitive factors, 'individuals without a college degree' is not specifically listed in the answer key. The key mentions 'low level of intelligence' and 'low level of analytical thinking' as more precise cognitive factors.
- Correct: Being 'prone to paranoia' aligns well with several factors from the answer key, particularly 'attributing agency where it does not exist' and 'seeing patterns in randomness,' which are core components of paranoid thinking.
- Correct: This directly matches 'being narcissistic' from the answer key, which is explicitly listed as a personality factor contributing to conspiratorial thinking.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

These incorrect answers can hinder learning due to source amnesia, which is our tendency to forget the origin of certain information. In this situation, we may fail to recall that our previous answers were wrong and instead associate them with the correct exam answers, leading us to mistakenly consider our own incorrect responses during the test.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies source amnesia as the psychological mechanism and accurately explains how it operates in this context - forgetting that the initially provided answer was incorrect and mistaking it for the correct answer. The explanation demonstrates clear understanding of the concept and its application to the quiz scenario.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

When a politician repeats certain statements, they tap into our natural preference for information that aligns with our beliefs. Hearing the same message multiple times increases our familiarity with it, making us more prone to agree.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that repeated exposure increases familiarity and makes people more likely to agree with or prefer the message. This demonstrates understanding of the mere exposure effect, even though they don't use the specific term.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Yes. People become less accurate because they are prone to a negativity bias, which can often override their usual positivity bias.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that major depressive disorder makes people less accurate at predictions due to negativity bias. The correct answer is that people with depression are actually more accurate because they have reduced optimism bias, not less accurate due to negativity bias.

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

In such situations, we are more likely to depend on our existing beliefs.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when sensory information is unreliable, we depend more on existing beliefs/prior expectations, which directly captures the key concept that prior beliefs have increased influence on perception when sensory reliability decreases.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

These stages include 1. the pre-conventional level (focused on self-interest) where moral decisions are driven by personal gain, 2. the conventional level where morality is guided by the expectations of others, their feelings, and existing laws, and 3. the post-conventional level where moral choices are founded on universal ethical principles.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the pre-conventional level and describes it as focused on self-interest and personal gain, which aligns with the answer key's description of avoiding punishment or gaining rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as being guided by expectations of others, their feelings, and existing laws, which matches the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the post-conventional level and describes it as being founded on universal ethical principles, which aligns with the answer key's description of focus on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model of past events is one that demonstrates how a phenomenon, like hindsight bias, comes about. It helps explain hindsight bias by providing a framework for understanding its formation. According to this model, when we attempt to comprehend why something happened, we evaluate whether the explanation is logical, and if it seems reasonable, the feeling of inevitability takes hold, indicating that hindsight bias has occurred.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes a causal model as explaining how hindsight bias comes about, rather than as a coherent narrative of how past events are related. They misunderstand what a causal model is in this context.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that causal models contribute to hindsight bias by creating a sense of inevitability when explanations seem reasonable and logical, which aligns with the key point about events seeming more inevitable than they were.

Score: 0.5

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Some theories suggest that when we learn information—such as an outcome—we adjust our probability cues based on that knowledge. Thus, when we attempt to recall previous probability assessments, we essentially re-evaluate them using these updated cues, causing our judgments to consistently align more closely with the outcome we have learned.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly explains that learning new information (outcomes) inevitably influences our ability to accurately recall past probability judgments, as we cannot separate our current knowledge from our attempts to remember previous assessments. This demonstrates understanding of how newly acquired information contaminates our recollection of prior likelihood estimates.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

The satisficing decision style focuses on choosing an option that is satisfactory, leading to greater contentment and fewer feelings of regret. In contrast, the maximizing decision style involves seeking the optimal choice, which tends to result in lower satisfaction and increased regret. Individuals with high levels of neuroticism are more prone to use the maximizing approach.

Feedback:

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

Initially, I was quite hesitant about the idea of AI grading us since I had no prior experience with advanced AI systems. I felt like our efforts and time weren’t being valued and that we weren’t being taken seriously. However, after practicing with the AI, I became much more confident in its ability to do an excellent job because it demonstrated a stronger understanding of our subjects compared to something like ChatGPT. While the concept of AI grading might seem discouraging at first, I ultimately appreciate it because our instructor is very passionate about the material and genuinely appears to be making a sincere effort to incorporate important, emerging technologies into our education. I would approach this similarly to how you did—by experimenting with the AI, which boosted my trust in it, and thanks to having an excellent lecturer, I remained fully engaged. I’m not sure I would feel the same way in a different course with another instructor.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement with the question by reflecting on their personal experience with AI grading, discussing the evolution of their perspective from initial hesitancy to acceptance, and identifying key factors that contributed to successful student engagement (instructor passion, experimentation with AI, building trust). The answer shows thoughtful consideration of the teaching challenge and proposes a concrete approach based on their learning experience.
