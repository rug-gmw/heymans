## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

System 1 operates quickly and automatically, relying on heuristics and biases, while System 2 is deliberate, logical, and open to intervention. The model suggests that System 1 is the more dominant of the two.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes System 1 as operating quickly and automatically with heuristics and biases, but fails to connect this specifically to intuitions or emotions in the context of moral judgment as required by the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student describes System 2 as deliberate and logical, but does not explicitly identify it as reasoning, rational thought, or deliberation in the context of moral reasoning as specified in the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 is more dominant than System 2 according to Haidt's model.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

This assumption stems from the representativeness heuristic, where we link a characteristic—such as someone resembling a fashion model—to the category that they are probably a fashion model.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process in this scenario.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of the representativeness heuristic by explaining that we link physical characteristics (resembling a fashion model) to category membership (being a fashion model), which captures the essence of estimating likelihood based on resemblance to stereotypes.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring involves establishing a reference point that serves as an initial benchmark. The primacy effect refers to the first impression, which holds the most significance and tends to remain the most consistent. Both concepts share the idea that the primacy effect functions as an anchor by creating a particular standard.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as establishing a reference point/initial benchmark, which aligns with the answer key's description of taking the first piece of information as a starting point.
- Incorrect: The student describes primacy effect as 'first impression' that 'holds significance and remains consistent' but misses the key concept that it's about better remembering the first piece of information.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both concepts share an overreliance on first/initial information, describing how primacy effect functions as an anchor by creating a standard.

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency for individuals to consider losses as more significant than equivalent gains, while risk aversion involves a primary focus on avoiding potential risks.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves weighing losses more heavily than equivalent gains, which matches the answer key's definition.
- Incorrect: The student describes risk aversion as 'avoiding potential risks' rather than the preference for certainty over uncertainty. This is too vague and doesn't capture the specific concept of preferring certain outcomes over uncertain ones.

Score: 0.5

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias relates to the way we anticipate the effects a decision will have on us. These effects can take various forms, such as emotional or financial consequences, which can hold us back and make us feel trapped. This bias can stop individuals from ending unhappy relationships for several reasons. For example, they might fear not finding another partner and worry about being alone. Additionally, if a couple is financially dependent, concerns about potential financial hardship after a breakup may also deter them from separating.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student provides a vague description of impact bias as anticipating effects of decisions, but fails to capture the key definition: the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings. The answer lacks the crucial element of overestimation.
- Incorrect: While the student discusses fears about breakups (loneliness, financial concerns), they don't connect this to impact bias as overestimating how bad the breakup will make them feel. The answer focuses on practical concerns rather than the psychological bias of overestimating emotional impact.

Score: 0.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves making choices based on the emotions we expect a decision will generate for ourselves or those we care about. It is crucial to keep this in mind when making end-of-life decisions because affective forecasting can cause us to make choices that do not truly reflect our own desires, but rather aim to fulfill what we think others, such as family, close friends, or society, want from us—sometimes resulting in personal unhappiness in order to please others.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly defines affective forecasting as making choices based on expected emotions for ourselves or others, when it specifically refers to predictions about our own future emotional states.
- Incorrect: The student focuses on social pressure and pleasing others rather than the key concept that healthy people may predict preferring death when sick, but actually may not prefer it when they become sick.

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

Prospect theory suggests that individuals often downplay very low probabilities, particularly when they are as small as 0.01%. People are more likely to pay attention to a probability of 10% than to one as tiny as 0.01%.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student states that people 'downplay very low probabilities' but doesn't clearly address whether merely low probabilities (10%) are overestimated, which is a key point from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that extremely low probabilities (0.01%) are downplayed or ignored, which aligns with the answer key point that they are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 0.5

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

In the context of prospect theory, loss aversion represents a form of negative utility.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies loss aversion as simply 'a form of negative utility' rather than explaining that it reflects the asymmetric weighting where negative utilities (losses) are weighed more heavily than positive utilities (gains) of equal magnitude.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Utility theory involves not only utilities but also several other factors that we consider, whereas expected value theory focuses solely on financial aspects.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory focuses on financial aspects while utility theory considers broader factors beyond just financial values.
- Incorrect: The student mentions 'several other factors' but does not specifically identify risk aversion or the consideration of heuristics and biases as the key difference.

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Utility theory involves assigning values to utilities to make decisions. Prospect theory builds on utility theory by incorporating additional factors. Loss aversion refers to giving greater importance to losses compared to gains. Expected value theory focuses solely on financial aspects when making decisions.

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies expected value theory as focusing on financial aspects, which aligns with the answer key's description of financial outcomes with probabilities.
- Incorrect: Student mentions 'utility theory' generically but fails to specifically identify expected utility theory or explain how it differs from expected value theory by incorporating subjective utilities beyond financial outcomes.
- Incorrect: Student does not mention multi-attribute utility theory at all, missing this key model that involves multiple attributes with utilities and weights.
- Incorrect: While student mentions prospect theory builds on utility theory and references loss aversion, they fail to identify it as a descriptive/behavioral model or explain its relationship to heuristics and biases as specified in the answer key.

Score: 0.25

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Loss aversion influences how risk-averse individuals are because it means they place greater importance on potential losses than on gains, which can lead them to take fewer or smaller risks.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that loss aversion makes people take fewer risks and be more risk-averse. The answer key indicates the opposite - that loss aversion can actually decrease risk aversion and make people risk-seeking when trying to avoid potential losses.

Score: 0.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves establishing traits that help guide decision-making. The key distinction between classical and operant conditioning is that operant conditioning involves creating conditions for behavior to occur, even if those conditions are not ideal.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes conditioning as 'establishing traits that help guide decision-making' rather than learning associations through covariation, which misses the core concept of associative learning.
- Incorrect: The student does not address classical conditioning at all - there is no mention of learning associations between stimuli that occur together in time and space.
- Incorrect: The student's description of operant conditioning as 'creating conditions for behavior to occur' does not capture the key concept that it involves learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 0.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation involves mistakenly perceiving a cause-and-effect relationship, while illusory correlation refers to seeing a connection between two unrelated pieces of information.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that illusory causation involves mistakenly perceiving a cause-and-effect relationship and that illusory correlation involves seeing connections between unrelated variables. While the phrasing differs from the answer key, the core concepts are accurately captured.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

Understanding the Dutch healthcare system is like following a script because it requires adhering to specific procedures and guidelines. In contrast, knowing how to behave appropriately at a party is more like having a schema, since there isn't a strict set of rules to follow, as long as you act respectfully toward others.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the healthcare system as a script when it should be a schema. Healthcare system knowledge involves understanding concepts, relationships, and structures rather than following sequential behavioral steps.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies birthday party behavior as a schema when it should be a script. Birthday party behavior involves following specific social sequences and behavioral expectations for that particular situation, which is characteristic of a script.

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

Behaviorists should concentrate on how stimuli trigger behavior, making the intentional stance (prescriptive) the most appropriate approach since it examines the stimuli that cause specific behaviors.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the intentional stance as the behaviorist approach. Behaviorists adopted the physical stance because they focused on mechanical stimulus-response processes rather than beliefs, desires, or intentions. The intentional stance involves attributing mental states and purposes, which behaviorists explicitly rejected in favor of observable physical processes.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

Psychologists use the intentional stance to understand the reasons behind why individuals make or choose certain decisions.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the intentional stance instead of the design stance. The intentional stance involves attributing beliefs and desires to explain behavior, while evolutionary psychologists use the design stance by examining psychological processes in terms of their adaptive function and evolutionary purpose.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Believable

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student only provided the single word 'Believable' which does not mention or explain distinctness/specificity as a heuristic for judging causation.
- Incorrect: The student's response does not address consistency as a heuristic - the idea that B should always follow A for causal inference.
- Incorrect: While 'Believable' could relate to plausibility, the student does not explicitly identify plausibility as a heuristic or explain that it involves common sense assessment of causal relationships.
- Incorrect: The student's answer does not mention contiguity in time and space as a heuristic for determining causation.
- Incorrect: The student does not identify similarity in cause and effect as a heuristic for judging whether A causes B.

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Negativity bias refers to our tendency to focus on negative information. Hindsight bias occurs when we think we predicted an outcome all along. These biases combine to create an overestimation because, having frequently observed moral outrage on social media, we are inclined to look for negative aspects and assume from the beginning that situations will have negative results.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias and provides an accurate definition as the tendency to focus on negative information.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies hindsight bias instead of the availability heuristic. Hindsight bias is about retrospectively thinking you predicted an outcome, not about estimating frequency based on ease of recall.
- Incorrect: The student's explanation of how the biases combine is incorrect because they used the wrong second bias. Their mechanism doesn't properly explain how negativity bias and availability heuristic work together to overestimate moral outrage frequency.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

When it comes to framework theories across various knowledge areas, avoiding the use of things linked to someone you strongly dislike relates to the fact that the item is tied to a framework you find unfavorable. If you possess more information about the disliked person—and that information is negative—you become even less inclined to use what is associated with that disliked framework.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's answer focuses on general framework theory concepts but fails to identify the key point: that biological contagion concepts are being inappropriately applied to the social/psychological domain. The answer doesn't mention the cross-domain misapplication that characterizes magical thinking about contagion.

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A delusional conspiracy theory is one that cannot be true for various reasons, such as involving unrealistic situations or possibly stemming from the individual's mental health or substance use. In contrast, a non-delusional conspiracy theory is one that is plausible or may have occurred because it is logical, sensible, and based on rational thought, although it has not been confirmed.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student focuses on plausibility and mental health factors but misses the key distinction from the answer key that a conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both irrational AND not commonly accepted. The student doesn't mention the social acceptance component, which is crucial to the definition.

Score: 0.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

Hindsight bias can lead us to develop conspiracies that might not be accurate, using supposed evidence to support a situation that may not actually exist, simply to validate the belief that we anticipated it all along. Outcome bias is connected to conspiratorial thinking by attributing blame for a bad result to someone undeservedly, which ties back to hindsight bias. Negativity bias may contribute to conspiratorial thinking by causing us to focus on negative aspects, which can result in the formation of negative beliefs that resemble conspiracies.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student discusses hindsight bias, which is not listed among the cognitive and personality factors in the answer key. While related to cognitive biases, it doesn't match any of the specified factors like seeing patterns in randomness or believing paranormal phenomena.
- Incorrect: The student mentions outcome bias, which is also not included in the answer key factors. This bias concept doesn't align with the listed factors such as attributing agency where it doesn't exist or believing in simple explanations for complex events.
- Incorrect: The student discusses negativity bias, which is not among the answer key factors. While the student attempts to connect it to conspiratorial thinking, it doesn't match any of the specified factors like narcissism, low intelligence, or low analytical thinking.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

The psychological process that can disrupt learning is illusory correlation.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies illusory correlation as the mechanism. Illusory correlation refers to perceiving a relationship between variables when none exists, which is not relevant to forgetting the source of incorrect answers or interference between incorrect and correct information during learning.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

Besides using the availability heuristic, they enhance the appeal of their message by repeatedly presenting it, aiming to link it with their political party through the representativeness heuristic, as they seek to connect the message to their identity or political affiliation.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the mechanism. The correct answer is mere exposure effect (or illusory-truth effect), which explains how repeated exposure to information makes it seem more familiar and therefore more attractive or believable. The representativeness heuristic involves judging probability based on similarity to mental prototypes, which is not the psychological mechanism at work when repetition increases message appeal.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

No, it does not reduce these individuals' accuracy in making such predictions.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly states that major depressive disorder does not reduce accuracy, but fails to explain the key mechanism - that people with depression are more accurate because they show reduced optimistic bias compared to non-depressed individuals.

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

When sensory information becomes less reliable, we tend to reduce our confidence in our prior beliefs because we receive different sensory inputs than before, prompting us to question and potentially revise those prior beliefs.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's answer contradicts the correct principle. They claim that unreliable sensory information reduces confidence in prior beliefs, when actually the ideal-observer model predicts the opposite: when sensory information is unreliable, we rely MORE heavily on prior beliefs to guide perception.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model of past events is a person's recollection of previous occurrences that have influenced a particular outcome. This plays a role in hindsight bias because individuals link the outcome to these memories and believe they predicted the result from the beginning, even though they actually did not.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a causal model involves connecting past events to outcomes, which aligns with the concept of a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student accurately explains how causal models contribute to hindsight bias by making people believe they predicted outcomes they actually didn't, which captures the essence of events seeming more inevitable than they were.

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Learning plays a role in hindsight bias because when we acquire new information, we often convince ourselves that we already knew it beforehand. This tendency grows stronger as our minds try to believe we anticipated the outcome from the beginning.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes a general tendency to believe we knew information beforehand, but misses the key mechanism: that when estimating past likelihood judgments, we cannot avoid incorporating newly learned information into those estimates. The answer doesn't address the specific cognitive process of how new knowledge contaminates our ability to accurately recall what we previously thought was likely.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing decision style involves striving to make the best possible choice and is linked to the personality trait of neuroticism. In contrast, satisficing decision style focuses on choosing an option that meets acceptable criteria, even if it isn't the absolute best for the situation. Individuals with high levels of neuroticism are more likely to use the maximizing decision style.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as 'striving to make the best possible choice' which aligns with the answer key's definition of 'trying to make the best choice'.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as 'choosing an option that meets acceptable criteria, even if it isn't the absolute best' which corresponds to the answer key's 'making a good-enough choice'.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that 'individuals with high levels of neuroticism are more likely to use the maximizing decision style' which matches the answer key exactly.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

In situations with limited time and resources, multiple choice or short answer exams are ideal because they require less grading time—multiple choice questions need no personalized feedback, and short answer questions only require minimal feedback. Although AI technology in 2024 could significantly reduce grading time by easing the graders' workload, developing and integrating such systems into a university's grading process could demand substantial resources. Additionally, using multiple choice and short answer formats can conserve resources since they are quicker to create and assess, typically relying on standardized answer rubrics that save time and effort in grading and providing feedback.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement by analyzing the trade-offs between different assessment methods (multiple choice vs. short answer), considering practical constraints (time and resources), discussing modern technological solutions (AI grading), and addressing implementation challenges. The response shows thoughtful consideration of how to balance active engagement with efficiency constraints.
