## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidtâ€™s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

System 1 represents our moral intuition, while System 2 corresponds to our moral reasoning. When we make a moral judgment, System 1 generates an immediate emotional reaction, and System 2 provides a rational justification for that intuition. According to the social intuitionist model, System 1, or our moral intuition, plays a more influential role in moral reasoning.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 represents moral intuition and mentions the immediate emotional reaction, which aligns with the answer key's requirement that System 1 refers to intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student accurately describes System 2 as corresponding to moral reasoning and providing rational justification, which matches the answer key's definition of System 2 as reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student clearly states that System 1 (moral intuition) plays a more influential role in moral reasoning, which directly corresponds to the answer key's point that System 1 is more dominant than System 2.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

Representative heuristic refers to the tendency of individuals to assess the probability that something (such as a colleague) fits into a certain category (like models) by how closely that thing matches the typical characteristics of the category (the colleague looks like a model, so they are likely to be one).

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process, though they spell it as 'Representative heuristic' instead of 'representativeness heuristic' - this is a minor spelling variation that doesn't affect the core understanding.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that the representativeness heuristic involves estimating probability of category membership based on similarity to typical characteristics or stereotypes of that category, and correctly applies this to the specific example of the colleague looking like a fashion model.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring occurs when an initial piece of information, known as the anchor, influences how subsequent information is interpreted by adjusting from that starting point. If this adjustment is insufficient, the primacy effect occurs, meaning the first information received has a disproportionately stronger impact than information presented afterward.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as involving an initial piece of information that serves as a starting point and influences subsequent interpretation, which aligns with the answer key's definition.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly defines the primacy effect as a consequence of insufficient adjustment from anchoring, rather than as the tendency to better remember the first piece of information as stated in the answer key.
- Correct: The student implicitly demonstrates understanding that both concepts involve overreliance on first information by describing how initial information has disproportionate impact, though not explicitly stated as a commonality.

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

In loss aversion, losses are felt more intensely than equivalent gains, whereas in risk aversion, individuals tend to steer clear of any risk whenever possible.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves losses being felt more intensely than equivalent gains, which accurately captures the concept of weighing losses more heavily than gains.
- Incorrect: The student's description of risk aversion as 'steering clear of any risk whenever possible' is too absolute and inaccurate. Risk aversion is about preferring certainty over uncertainty, not avoiding all risk entirely.

Score: 0.5

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias refers to the tendency to overestimate how much a future event will influence our emotions. This can cause individuals to avoid ending a relationship because they believe the emotional pain will be far greater than it actually is, even if they are unhappy in the relationship.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as the tendency to overestimate how much a future event will influence our emotions, which matches the answer key's definition of overestimating the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Correct: The student accurately explains how impact bias prevents breakups by stating that people believe the emotional pain will be far greater than it actually is, which aligns with the answer key's point about overestimating how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting refers to our ability to predict how a future event will make us feel, and we often depend on these predictions when planning for the future. However, these forecasts can be inaccurate and may not truly reflect our actual feelings when the situation occurs. This is particularly important in end-of-life decisions, as research shows that people tend to make different choices when they are healthy compared to when they are seriously ill and facing such decisions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines affective forecasting as predictions about future emotional states, specifically 'our ability to predict how a future event will make us feel.'
- Correct: The student accurately captures the key insight that healthy people make different end-of-life choices compared to when they are actually ill, demonstrating understanding of the forecasting error in this context.

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

According to prospect theory, individuals tend to overvalue small probabilities. The distinction between low probabilities and extremely low probabilities is that the latter are perceived as impossible, while the former are exaggerated.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that low probabilities are overvalued/overestimated according to prospect theory.
- Correct: The student accurately distinguishes that extremely low probabilities are perceived as impossible while low probabilities are exaggerated, which aligns with the answer key's distinction.

Score: 1.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion in the context of utility in prospect theory means that losses are experienced as more significant than equivalent gains and carry a stronger negative utility compared to the positive utility of similar gains.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that losses carry stronger negative utility compared to positive utility of equivalent gains, which directly corresponds to the answer key's point that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory applies solely to financial choices, whereas expected utility theory can be used for both financial and non-financial decisions. Additionally, expected utility theory considers risk aversion, which expected value theory does not.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory deals only with financial values while expected utility theory can handle both financial and non-financial values/decisions.
- Correct: The student correctly states that expected utility theory considers risk aversion while expected value theory does not, which aligns with the answer key's point about heuristics and biases.

Score: 1.0

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesnâ€™t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected value theory suggests that the best choice is the one with the greatest monetary value. Expected utility theory considers the utility of each option as well, selecting the option where the product of utility and value is highest. Multiple attribute utility theory incorporates several attributes, along with their assigned rankings and weights, to determine the most favorable option. Prospect theory is a descriptive model of decision-making that accounts for people's biases and heuristics in their choices.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as focusing on monetary/financial outcomes and selecting the option with greatest value, which aligns with the normative model described in the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student misunderstands expected utility theory by describing it as 'product of utility and value' rather than understanding that utility replaces monetary value as the measure of outcome desirability with associated probabilities.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies multi-attribute utility theory as incorporating multiple attributes with rankings/weights to determine the best option, matching the key concept from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies prospect theory as a descriptive model that accounts for biases and heuristics in decision-making, which matches the answer key's description.

Score: 0.75

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease peopleâ€™s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Individuals perceive losses as more significant than comparable gains and are willing to take substantial risks to prevent losing something.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people will take substantial risks to prevent losses, which demonstrates understanding that loss aversion can make people risk-seeking rather than risk-averse when facing potential losses.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning is the process of learning through association. Classical conditioning occurs when we understand that certain stimuli are linked because they happen near each other in time and location, while operant conditioning involves learning which actions lead to rewards and which lead to punishments.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as learning through association, which aligns with the answer key's definition of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as understanding that stimuli are linked when they happen near each other in time and location, which matches the answer key's explanation of associating things that tend to happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning which actions lead to rewards and punishments, which directly corresponds to the answer key's definition of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory correlation occurs when we perceive a relationship between two things that doesn't actually exist, while illusory causation happens when we assume one thing causes another simply because they are correlated.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly distinguishes both concepts: illusory correlation as perceiving a non-existent relationship between variables, and illusory causation as incorrectly inferring causation from correlation. The definitions align with the answer key requirements.

Score: 1.0

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to â€˜properlyâ€™ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

The healthcare system operates as a schema, providing a structure for understanding how certain processes function and enabling us to anticipate outcomes. Similarly, knowing how to act at a birthday party is a script, which is a specific type of schema related to everyday behavior and shaped by cultural norms.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the healthcare system as a schema and provides a good explanation that it provides structure for understanding processes and relationships, which aligns with the answer key's emphasis on knowledge and relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies birthday party behavior as a script and explains it as a specific type of schema related to everyday behavior shaped by cultural norms, which matches the answer key's description of a social schema for specific situational behavior.

Score: 1.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

They adopted a mechanistic perspective, which aims to explain events by identifying their causes. They sought to understand behavior by examining how certain stimuli triggered other stimuli.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes a 'mechanistic perspective' which is conceptually similar to the physical stance, but they don't use Dennett's terminology of 'physical stance' as required by the question. Additionally, their explanation about 'stimuli triggering other stimuli' is inaccurate - behaviorists focused on how stimuli trigger behaviors, not other stimuli.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

They take an intentional stance, which seeks to explain actions based on people's behavior and intentions. Ingroup favoritism is a type of behavior that can be understood through this approach.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the intentional stance instead of the design stance. While they show understanding that evolutionary psychology explains behavior functionally, the intentional stance focuses on beliefs and desires to predict behavior, whereas evolutionary psychology adopts the design stance by examining psychological processes in terms of their adaptive function and evolutionary purpose.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

- Distinct: If only A leads to B, then A must be the cause of B.  
- Consistent: If A always leads to B, then A is the cause of B.  
- Plausible: Based on what I know about B, it is reasonable to believe that A causes B.  
- Congruency in time and space: If B occurs soon after A, then A is likely the cause of B.  
- Similarity in cause and effect: In other cases, A has also resulted in B.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies distinctness/specificity and explains that A causes B when only A leads to B, which matches the concept that B follows A but not other events.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies consistency and explains that A always leading to B indicates causation, which aligns with the answer key's definition.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies plausibility and explains it as being reasonable to believe A causes B based on knowledge, which matches the common sense aspect from the answer key.
- Correct: The student identifies contiguity in time and space (using 'congruency') and explains temporal proximity correctly, though they omit the spatial aspect mentioned in the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student misunderstands similarity in cause and effect. They describe it as 'A has also resulted in B in other cases' (consistency across cases), but the answer key refers to A and B superficially resembling each other.

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

This occurs when individuals combine theories from various fields and, for instance, attempt to use concepts from one area to explain a phenomenon in another, where such application is not appropriate.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that this involves inappropriately applying concepts from one domain to explain phenomena in another domain, which captures the essence of incorrectly applying biological contagion concepts to social/psychological situations.

Score: 1.0

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A non-delusional conspiracy is believed by a larger number of people.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student only mentions that non-delusional conspiracies are believed by more people, which captures the 'commonly accepted' aspect but completely omits the crucial 'irrational belief' component that distinguishes delusional from non-delusional conspiracy theories.

Score: 0.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

Narcissism, lack of intelligence, and moral outrage are all traits linked to belief in conspiracy theories.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies narcissism as a personality factor contributing to conspiratorial thinking, which matches the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies lack of intelligence as a cognitive factor contributing to conspiratorial thinking, which aligns with 'having a low level of intelligence' from the answer key.
- Incorrect: Moral outrage is not listed among the cognitive and personality factors in the answer key. The student should have mentioned one of the other factors like seeing patterns in randomness, believing paranormal phenomena, or attributing agency where it does not exist.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you donâ€™t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

We frequently fail to recall whether an answer was right or wrong; we just remember the answer itself. This can hinder learning when the wrong answer is remembered instead of the correct one.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the core mechanism of source amnesia - forgetting whether an answer was right or wrong while remembering the answer itself, and explains how this leads to remembering incorrect answers instead of correct ones, which matches the key concept in the answer key.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

The mere exposure effect means that people tend to prefer things simply because they are familiar with them. When someone encounters a message repeatedly, they become more accustomed to it and consequently find it more appealing and attractive.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the mere exposure effect and accurately explains that repeated exposure to messages leads to increased familiarity and preference, which directly answers how politicians use this mechanism to make their messages more attractive.

Score: 1.0

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

People often underestimate the chances of negative events occurring to them and overestimate the chances of positive events. However, individuals with depression typically do not exhibit this bias, so their assessments of the likelihood of negative outcomes tend to be more realistic.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people with depression are more accurate at predicting negative events because they lack the optimistic bias that non-depressed individuals typically show, making their assessments more realistic.

Score: 1.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

When the accuracy of sensory input diminishes, we depend more heavily on our existing beliefs, causing our perception to align more closely with those prior beliefs.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when sensory information becomes less reliable (described as 'accuracy diminishes'), prior beliefs have increased influence on perception ('depend more heavily on existing beliefs'). This captures the core concept that unreliable sensory evidence leads to greater reliance on prior expectations in perceptual decision making.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You donâ€™t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other peopleâ€™s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

Pre-conventional; focusing on oneself and mutual exchange, conventional; considering others, post-conventional; understanding morality as universal.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the pre-conventional level and describes it as focusing on oneself and mutual exchange, which aligns with the focus on avoiding punishment and gaining rewards.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the conventional level and describes it as considering others, which matches the focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the post-conventional level and describes it as understanding morality as universal, which aligns with the focus on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

The causal model of a past event refers to our inclination to link two stimuli or events that occur near each other in time and place as cause and effect. When we establish this causal connection, we believe the outcome was unavoidable. This belief fuels hindsight bias, making us feel as if we predicted the result all along.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes causal models as linking two stimuli based on proximity in time and place, which is more about correlation or association. The answer key requires understanding causal models as coherent narratives of how past events are related, which is broader than just temporal/spatial proximity.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that causal models make outcomes seem unavoidable/inevitable and connects this to hindsight bias, which aligns with the answer key's point about events seeming more inevitable than they were.

Score: 0.5

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

We struggle to avoid knowing the actual result once we've learned it, which can make us feel as though we predicted it all along, leading to hindsight bias.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that once we learn new information (the actual result), we cannot avoid incorporating this knowledge when trying to recall our past judgments, which leads to hindsight bias. This captures the essence of how learning contributes to hindsight bias as described in the answer key.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Satisficing involves choosing an option that meets an acceptable level of adequacy, while maximizing entails striving to select the absolute best choice, often linked to perfectionism and accompanied by emotions like regret and dissatisfaction. Individuals with high levels of neuroticism are more prone to use a maximizing decision style, as it reflects a tendency toward perfectionism.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as 'striving to select the absolute best choice,' which aligns with the answer key's definition of 'trying to make the best choice.'
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as 'choosing an option that meets an acceptable level of adequacy,' which matches the answer key's definition of 'making a good-enough choice.'
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that individuals with high neuroticism are more prone to use a maximizing decision style, directly matching the answer key's requirement.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

One approach is to introduce a nudge through an optional assignment that encourages participation without making it compulsory, as students tend to do the least work possible for the greatest reward. For instance, students could have the option to complete a weekly assignment that offers a 10% bonus added to their total score. Although not required, this incentive nudges students to participate. If they skip the assignment, they might see it as missing out on a potential 10% boost, motivating them to take part. Making the assignment mandatory might reduce their enthusiasm, whereas choosing to engage voluntarily could increase their enjoyment of the course, which can be explained by cognitive dissonance theory. To manage limited time and resources, grading could be handled through peer review or a language-based rating system similar to the one used in this exam.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement by proposing a specific solution (optional assignments with bonus incentives), referencing relevant psychological concepts (cognitive dissonance theory), and addressing the resource constraint through practical grading alternatives (peer review, automated systems). The answer shows thoughtful consideration of student motivation and practical implementation challenges.
