## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

The social intuitionist model suggests that system 1 thinking is the intuitive and emotional form of moral reasoning, whereas system 2 involves a more logical and reflective process. This model proposes that system 1 plays a primary role in making moral decisions, with system 2 engaging only in specific situations.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies System 1 thinking as 'intuitive and emotional form of moral reasoning,' which aligns with the answer key's requirement to identify System 1 as intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student accurately describes System 2 as involving 'a more logical and reflective process,' which corresponds to the answer key's identification of System 2 as reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student states that 'system 1 plays a primary role in making moral decisions,' clearly indicating that System 1 is more dominant than System 2, which matches the answer key requirement.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

This appears to be an example of the representativeness heuristic. When we encounter a person or object that fits a certain prototype we have in mind (such as a fashion model), we often assume that the person or object belongs to or exemplifies that category.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process in this scenario.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of the representativeness heuristic by explaining that we assume category membership when someone fits our prototype/stereotype of that category, which aligns with the concept of estimating likelihood based on resemblance to stereotypes.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring occurs when we give greater weight to the first piece of information we receive and adjust our decisions based on that initial reference point. The primacy effect refers to our tendency to remember the first few items in a sequence more strongly than the rest. Both phenomena are related to how the sequence of information influences our perception and decision-making.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as giving greater weight to the first piece of information and using it as a reference point for decisions, which aligns with the answer key's definition of taking the first piece of information as the starting point.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as the tendency to remember the first few items in a sequence more strongly, which matches the answer key's definition of better remembering the first piece of information.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both phenomena relate to how the sequence of information influences perception and decision-making, which demonstrates understanding of their common reliance on first information, though expressed less directly than the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the preference for retaining what one already possesses or avoiding losses rather than acquiring new gains. Risk aversion describes the tendency to favor options that appear more certain over those that involve risk.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves preferring to avoid losses rather than acquire gains, which captures the essence of weighing losses more heavily than equivalent gains.
- Correct: The student accurately describes risk aversion as favoring certainty over risky options, which aligns with the tendency to prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 1.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias refers to our tendency to exaggerate how strongly and for how long future events will affect our emotions. This bias is a type of mistake in predicting our future feelings. It can lead individuals to stay in unsatisfactory relationships because they anticipate that ending the relationship will cause them more prolonged and intense negative emotions than it actually would.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as the tendency to exaggerate how strongly and for how long future events will affect emotions, which aligns with overestimating the impact of future events on feelings.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that impact bias prevents breakups because people anticipate more prolonged and intense negative emotions from ending the relationship than would actually occur, which matches the answer key's point about overestimating how bad a breakup will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves predicting how we believe we will feel in the future regarding choices we make today. It is crucial in end-of-life decisions because we often misjudge the strength of our future emotions, and a decision made as a healthy person may differ when facing end-of-life care.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies affective forecasting as predictions about future emotional states, though they phrase it as 'how we believe we will feel in the future' which captures the same concept.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding that healthy people may make different decisions than when actually facing illness, correctly noting that 'a decision made as a healthy person may differ when facing end-of-life care.'

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

Prospect theory suggests that individuals often undervalue small probabilities, especially when those probabilities are very close to zero, leading them to believe that such events are unlikely to happen.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student states that individuals 'undervalue small probabilities' which contradicts the answer key point that merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that very small probabilities close to zero are treated as unlikely to happen, which aligns with the answer key point about extremely low probabilities being interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 0.5

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

From a utility perspective, loss aversion represents our reluctance to select an option that we perceive as possibly resulting in a loss.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes loss aversion as reluctance to select risky options, which is more about risk aversion or general decision-making behavior. The answer key specifically requires explaining that loss aversion means negative utilities are weighted more heavily than positive utilities, or that the value function is steeper for losses than gains. The student's answer misses this key mathematical/utility-based relationship.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

- In expected value theory, values are purely monetary, whereas in expected utility theory, utility relates to the purpose and application of the item being evaluated. - Expected value theory tends to be more objective, while expected utility theory involves a more subjective perspective.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory deals with monetary/financial values while expected utility theory considers broader utility beyond just financial measures, which aligns with the answer key's distinction between financial and non-financial values.
- Incorrect: The student mentions objectivity vs subjectivity but does not specifically address the key difference regarding heuristics/biases and risk aversion that is emphasized in the answer key.

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

1. Expected value theory explains how we select the option with the greatest expected value by comparing the expected values of various choices. 2. Expected utility theory describes how we make decisions by choosing the option that offers the highest expected utility among alternatives. 3. The Behavioral Life Cycle model illustrates how our decision-making evolves throughout our life and influences how we perceive and manage personal finances. 4. Prospect theory resembles expected utility theory but incorporates different heuristics and human behaviors into the decision-making process.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as involving comparison of expected values across options, though they don't mention the specific financial/probability aspects from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected utility theory as choosing options with highest expected utility, capturing the core concept even without mentioning the subjective nature of utility.
- Incorrect: The student mentions 'Behavioral Life Cycle model' instead of 'Multi-attribute utility theory'. This is a completely different model that doesn't match the answer key's description of multiple attributes with utilities and weights.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies prospect theory as similar to expected utility theory but incorporating heuristics and human behaviors, which aligns with the answer key's description of it being descriptive/behavioral.

Score: 0.75

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the idea that individuals tend to favor avoiding losses over acquiring equivalent gains. This influences behavior by making people more risk-averse generally, but when faced with potential losses, they may become more willing to take risks to prevent those losses.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion can make people more willing to take risks when facing potential losses, which aligns with the key point that loss aversion decreases risk aversion and can make people risk-seeking in loss domains.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning refers to the process by which we learn to connect or relate two distinct things or events. Classical conditioning occurs when we learn to link two events because they repeatedly occur together, while operant conditioning involves learning to associate specific behaviors or events with consequences such as rewards or punishments.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as learning to connect or relate events, which aligns with the key concept of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as learning to link events that repeatedly occur together, which matches the answer key's description of associating things that happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning to associate behaviors with consequences like rewards or punishments, which directly corresponds to the answer key's definition.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation occurs when we mistakenly believe that one event causes another, even though no such cause-and-effect relationship exists. Illusory correlation happens when we assume a connection or association between two events, but in reality, no such correlation is present.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly defines illusory correlation as perceiving a correlation where none exists, but incorrectly defines illusory causation as believing causation exists where it doesn't. The answer key specifies that illusory causation is when an actual correlation is misinterpreted as causation, not when causation is perceived where no relationship exists at all.

Score: 0.0

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

Grasping the Dutch healthcare system represents a schema, while knowing the appropriate behavior at a birthday party represents a script. A schema is a broad framework of knowledge about a more extensive idea (such as the healthcare system), whereas a script refers to the understanding of a particular event or activity (like attending a birthday party).

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the Dutch healthcare system as a schema and provides an accurate explanation that it represents a broad framework of knowledge about an extensive idea, which aligns with the answer key's description of schemas as knowledge and relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies birthday party behavior as a script and accurately explains that scripts refer to understanding of particular events or activities, which matches the answer key's description of scripts as social schemas describing behavior in specific situations.

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

I believe this aligns with the intentional stance or level of analysis because we focus on the reasons and intentions (the triggers behind behavior) in psychology, rather than the brain's structure or physical form.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the intentional stance. Behaviorists actually adopted the physical stance because they focused on observable stimulus-response relationships and rejected mentalistic concepts like intentions or reasons. The intentional stance involves attributing beliefs and desires, which behaviorists explicitly avoided.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

I believe this represents an analysis at the design level because it examines the function that a psychological process fulfills within a particular context (evolution) to explain behavior.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that evolutionary psychology adopts the design stance/level and provides an accurate explanation that it examines the function that psychological processes fulfill within an evolutionary context, which aligns with the answer key's emphasis on considering processes in terms of their function.

Score: 1.0

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

- Distinctiveness: Whether B occurs exclusively when A occurs, or if B can also happen independently of A, ensuring no alternate causes are present.  
- Togetherness in space and time: Whether A and B take place simultaneously and in the same location.  
- Consistency: Whether A and B consistently or frequently occur together, rather than only occasionally or in isolated instances.  
- Plausibility: Whether it is reasonable to expect A and B to occur together.  
- Whether A solely causes B or if A appears to lead to other outcomes as well.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies distinctiveness/specificity, explaining that B should occur exclusively when A occurs with no alternate causes present, which matches the answer key's concept.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies consistency, explaining that A and B should consistently occur together rather than occasionally, which aligns with the answer key's requirement that B always follows A.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies plausibility, explaining it should be reasonable to expect A and B to occur together, which matches the answer key's common sense plausibility criterion.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies contiguity in time and space as 'togetherness in space and time', explaining A and B should occur simultaneously and in the same location, matching the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student's fifth point about whether A solely causes B or leads to other outcomes does not match the answer key's 'similarity in cause and effect' heuristic, which refers to superficial resemblance between A and B.

Score: 0.8

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Negativity bias and availability bias both play a role in causing us to overestimate the number of people expressing moral outrage on social media. Negativity bias drives us to pay more attention to emotionally negative content, which often includes morally outraged posts. This influences algorithms to show us such content more frequently. Availability bias occurs when information that is easier to access appears more common or likely. Therefore, seeing a lot of morally outraged posts leads us to believe they represent the majority, resulting in an overestimation of their actual prevalence.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias and explains it as the tendency to pay more attention to emotionally negative content, which aligns with the answer key's definition of seeking out or placing more weight on negative information.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies availability bias (referred to as availability heuristic in the answer key) and explains it as when information that is easier to access appears more common, which matches the answer key's definition of estimating frequency based on ease of recall.
- Correct: The student successfully explains the causal relationship between the two biases - that negativity bias causes us to see more morally outraged content, which through availability bias leads us to overestimate moral outrage prevalence, matching the answer key's explanation of the mechanism.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

This phenomenon can be understood through biology's perspective of avoiding contamination from substances that appear dirty or germ-filled. However, we often apply this framework too broadly, extending it into areas where it doesn't appropriately fit.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that biological contagion concepts (avoiding contamination/germs) are being inappropriately applied beyond their proper domain, which matches the answer key's point about incorrectly applying biological domain concepts to social/psychological domains.

Score: 1.0

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A delusional conspiracy theory is one that is rejected by cultural or social norms, whereas a non-delusional conspiracy theory is one that is generally accepted or tolerated within a culture or society.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student only addresses the social acceptance criterion but completely omits the rationality/irrationality component. According to the answer key, a delusional conspiracy theory requires both irrational belief AND lack of common acceptance, but the student's answer focuses solely on cultural acceptance without mentioning the rationality aspect.

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

1. Seeking straightforward reasons for occurrences or phenomena 2. Elevated levels of neuroticism 3. Inclined to perceive connections in unrelated events

Feedback:

- Correct: This correctly identifies believing in simple explanations for complex events, which is listed in the answer key as a factor contributing to conspiratorial thinking.
- Incorrect: Elevated levels of neuroticism is not mentioned in the answer key. The answer key includes narcissism as a personality factor, but not neuroticism.
- Correct: This correctly identifies seeing patterns in randomness/unrelated events, which is the first factor listed in the answer key.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Encountering incorrect answers can disrupt learning due to source invariance, a psychological effect where we often forget where we obtained certain information. As a result, we might mistakenly believe the wrong answer is true simply because we no longer remember its original source.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies source amnesia (referring to it as 'source invariance') as the mechanism by which incorrect answers can interfere with learning. They accurately explain that forgetting the source of information can lead to mistaking incorrect answers for correct ones, which matches the key concept in the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

They could be attempting to leverage the mere exposure effect by repeating their message often to make it more appealing. This effect causes people to become familiar with a message simply because they have encountered it repeatedly, leading them to perceive it as true or accurate.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the mere exposure effect as the psychological mechanism and accurately explains that repeated exposure leads to increased familiarity and preference. The student also demonstrates understanding of how this applies to political messaging, though they mention truth perception which relates more to the illusory-truth effect - but the core concept of mere exposure is properly identified and explained.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

I believe that major depressive disorder could lead to less accurate judgments because it causes a more negative and less objective perspective on your life and possible future events.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that major depressive disorder leads to less accurate predictions due to negative bias, when research shows that depressed individuals are actually more accurate at such predictions because they lack the optimistic bias that non-depressed people typically exhibit.

Score: 0.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

As the trustworthiness of sensory data diminishes, prior beliefs generally have a greater impact on perception.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when sensory information becomes less reliable (described as 'trustworthiness diminishes'), prior beliefs have a greater influence on perception. This accurately captures the core concept from the answer key.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

Moral development consists of three stages: preconventional, conventional, and postconventional. In the preconventional stage, moral decisions are primarily influenced by the desire to gain rewards or avoid punishment. During the conventional stage, an individual's morals conform to societal rules and the expectations of authority figures. In the postconventional stage, morality is seen as more individualized and flexible, sometimes differing from established laws or authority.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the preconventional level as being motivated by gaining rewards or avoiding punishment, which matches the answer key's focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as conforming to societal rules and expectations of authority figures, which aligns with the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly describes the postconventional level as individualized and flexible morality that can differ from established laws or authority, which corresponds to the answer key's focus on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

The causal model suggests that people tend to form causal connections to explain events rather than considering that an event merely 'might have' occurred, which can lead to hindsight bias.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a causal model involves forming causal connections to explain events, which aligns with the concept of a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student accurately explains how causal models contribute to hindsight bias by making people see events as more certain ('rather than considering that an event merely might have occurred') than they actually were, which matches the key point about events seeming more inevitable.

Score: 1.0

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Hindsight bias is partly influenced by learning. Once we discover the result of an event we were previously unaware of, it becomes difficult to disregard that knowledge when making similar assessments later. This tendency is considered an evolutionary adaptation that helps us learn efficiently from past experiences.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that learning contributes to hindsight bias by making it difficult to disregard newly acquired knowledge when making retrospective judgments. While they don't use the specific term 'curse of knowledge,' they capture the core concept that once we learn new information, we cannot avoid incorporating it into our past likelihood estimates.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximising refers to the desire to make the optimal decision, while satisficing involves settling for a choice that feels good enough without necessarily being the best. Individuals with high levels of neuroticism are more likely to adopt a maximising approach to decision-making.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as trying to make the optimal/best decision, which aligns with the answer key's description of 'trying to make the best choice'.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as settling for a choice that is good enough without being the best, which matches the answer key's definition of 'making a good-enough choice'.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that individuals high in neuroticism are more likely to adopt a maximizing decision style, which directly matches the answer key.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

I would consider several approaches. Based on certain decision-making models, I can't suggest a definitive plan due to insufficient information, but I do have some thoughts. First, peer review of assignments can be effective since students tend to provide valuable feedback when they expect the same in return. Second, assigning smaller tasks more frequently, such as every two weeks, can reduce the burden of grading many papers at once. Third, organizing practical groups led by student instructors can enhance student engagement and ensure they receive appropriate feedback from instructors.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement with the question by providing three concrete, well-reasoned approaches: peer review systems, frequent smaller assignments, and student-led practical groups. The answer shows understanding of the constraints (limited time/resources) and offers practical solutions that address both student engagement and grading efficiency. The acknowledgment of insufficient information for a definitive plan also shows thoughtful consideration of the problem's complexity.
