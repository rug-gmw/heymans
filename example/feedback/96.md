## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidtâ€™s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

In this model, system 1 provides people with an easily accessible and usable set of social norms they follow. When decisions made using this quick reference are challenged, they shift to system 2 thinking to assess, justify, or modify their social position and beliefs. The model suggests that system 1 is more influential, as we instinctively adhere to specific social rules.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes System 1 as providing 'social norms' rather than intuitions or emotions, which mischaracterizes Haidt's model where System 1 represents intuitive/emotional moral judgments.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies System 2 as involving assessment, justification, and modification of beliefs, which aligns with the reasoning/deliberation aspect from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly states that System 1 is more influential, noting that we 'instinctively adhere to specific social rules,' which captures the dominance of System 1 over System 2.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

The representativeness heuristic explains this assumption. It is a mental shortcut where we judge something to belong to a particular group simply because it resembles other members of that group.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying concept.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that the representativeness heuristic involves judging category membership based on resemblance to other group members, which captures the essence of estimating likelihood based on similarity to stereotypes.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring occurs when initial information serves as a reference point that we then modify based on additional related details we encounter later. Primacy refers to the tendency for the first information presented to have the strongest impact on our impressions and memory. Both phenomena depend on the influence of the information we receive initially.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as using initial information as a reference point, which aligns with the answer key's description of taking the first piece of information as the starting point.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as the tendency for first information to have the strongest impact on impressions and memory, which matches the answer key's point about better remembering first information.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both phenomena depend on the influence of initially received information, which corresponds to the answer key's point about overreliance on first information.

Score: 1.0

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency to give greater importance to losses than to equivalent gains. Risk aversion involves steering clear of risks, particularly when we feel confident about our existing circumstances.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves giving greater importance to losses than to equivalent gains, which matches the answer key's definition of weighing losses more heavily than gains.
- Incorrect: The student's definition of risk aversion as 'steering clear of risks, particularly when confident about existing circumstances' is incomplete and misses the key concept of preferring certainty over uncertainty that defines risk aversion.

Score: 0.5

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias occurs when we exaggerate how strongly a decision will affect our emotions. For example, individuals in unsatisfying relationships might overpredict the emotional distress a breakup would cause and therefore choose to remain in the unhappy relationship.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as exaggerating how strongly future events will affect emotions, which captures the essence of overestimating the impact of future events on feelings.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that people might stay in unhappy relationships because they overpredict the emotional distress of breaking up, which directly addresses how impact bias prevents breakups.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves relying on our present emotions when making choices. People often have a strong negative reaction to disability and therefore may prefer to "end their suffering" when making end-of-life decisions while feeling healthy. However, when individuals actually become old or disabled, they often view their circumstances more positively. If a person makes an end-of-life decision while young and healthy but later loses the ability to communicate, affective forecasting can negatively impact their life in that disabled state, potentially leading to the continuation of an end-of-life procedure they might no longer desire.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes affective forecasting as 'relying on our present emotions when making choices' rather than as predictions about future emotional states. While related, this misses the key concept that affective forecasting is specifically about predicting how we will feel in the future.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that healthy people may prefer to die when contemplating future illness/disability, but when they actually experience those conditions, they often view their circumstances more positively and may no longer desire death. This captures the essence of the discrepancy between predicted and actual preferences.

Score: 0.5

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

Prospect theory suggests that individuals disregard extremely small chances like 0.01% but often exaggerate moderately low probabilities around 10%.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that moderately low probabilities (around 10%) are exaggerated/overestimated according to prospect theory.
- Correct: The student accurately states that extremely small probabilities (like 0.01%) are disregarded, which aligns with the answer key point that they are treated as impossibilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion means that we tend to prioritize avoiding losses more than acquiring gains of the same value.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly describes the behavioral concept of loss aversion but fails to express it in terms of utility as required by the question. The answer does not mention that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities or that the value function is steeper for losses than gains.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected utility theory considers personal preferences and subjective values in addition to monetary amounts to decide the best option, unlike expected value theory. While expected value theory is limited to financial decisions, expected utility theory applies to both financial and non-financial contexts.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory deals only with financial/monetary values while expected utility theory incorporates broader considerations including non-financial values and personal preferences.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention the key distinction regarding heuristics, biases, and risk aversion. While they mention personal preferences, they miss the specific point about expected utility theory considering risk aversion as opposed to expected value theory's failure to account for such behavioral factors.

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesnâ€™t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected Value Theory is primarily applied to financial decisions, evaluating each option by its monetary value and selecting the one that maximizes this value; it is a normative model. Expected Utility Theory considers both financial value and personal utility for each option, aiming to maximize utility, and is also normative. Multi-Attribute Utility Theory incorporates financial value, subjective utility, and individual attributes for each choice, and is a normative model as well. Prospect Theory resembles expected utility theory but includes heuristics and biases, making it a descriptive model.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies Expected Value Theory as a normative model for financial decisions that evaluates options by monetary value to maximize expected value, which aligns with the answer key's description of choosing between options with financial outcomes and probabilities.
- Correct: The student accurately describes Expected Utility Theory as considering both financial value and personal utility to maximize utility, and correctly identifies it as normative, matching the answer key's explanation of outcomes having subjective utility beyond just financial value.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies Multi-Attribute Utility Theory as a normative model that incorporates multiple factors (financial value, subjective utility, and individual attributes), which corresponds to the answer key's description of options having multiple attributes with utilities and weights.
- Correct: The student accurately describes Prospect Theory as similar to expected utility theory but incorporating heuristics and biases, and correctly identifies it as a descriptive model, which matches the answer key's characterization as a behavioral/descriptive model.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease peopleâ€™s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

When choices are presented as gains, individuals tend to avoid risk because they focus on the positive outcomes they already possess and fear losing them. Conversely, when choices are framed as losses, people become more willing to take risks since they are concerned about potential negative outcomes and what they might forfeit if they don't take a chance.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion can make people more willing to take risks when facing potential losses, which aligns with the key point that loss aversion can decrease risk aversion and even make people risk seeking. The explanation of framing effects (gains vs losses) effectively demonstrates this concept.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning refers to the way our behavior changes in response to events that happen alongside us. In classical conditioning, our mind and behavior respond automatically to related events, reacting to a stimulus without control. In operant conditioning, we understand that our actions lead to certain outcomes, so the individual takes specific actions to receive a particular result.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as a learning process involving behavioral changes in response to environmental events, which aligns with learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as automatic responses to related events/stimuli, which captures the essence of learning associations when things happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as understanding that actions lead to outcomes and taking specific actions for particular results, which matches learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

In illusory correlations, individuals perceive relationships between things that are not really there. In illusory causations, individuals believe one event causes another when no such cause-and-effect relationship exists.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's definition of illusory causation is incorrect. They describe it as believing one event causes another when no causal relationship exists, but the answer key specifies that illusory causation occurs when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as causal (implying a correlation does exist but is misinterpreted). The student's definition of illusory correlation is correct.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to â€˜properlyâ€™ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

Knowing how to act correctly at a birthday party is an example of a script. A script is a framework used in particular social situations to guide suitable behavior. In contrast, understanding the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, representing a broader set of knowledge about how a system operates.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that understanding the Dutch healthcare system is a schema and provides an appropriate explanation that it represents knowledge about how a system operates, which aligns with schemas being knowledge structures about relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script and provides a good explanation that scripts are frameworks for guiding behavior in particular social situations, which matches the answer key's description of scripts as social schemas for specific situations.

Score: 1.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

Behaviorists took an intentional perspective, examining the reasons behind a person's intended response to specific stimuli.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identified the intentional stance instead of the physical stance. Behaviorists explicitly rejected mental states and intentions, focusing instead on observable stimulus-response relationships as physical processes, which corresponds to the physical stance.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

Evolutionary psychologists take a design perspective, assessing phenomena by their function. They use this approach to understand how evolution may have favored specific behaviors due to their advantages and roles.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance and provides the correct reasoning that they consider psychological processes in terms of their function. The additional explanation about evolution favoring behaviors due to their advantages aligns well with the functional perspective of the design stance.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Causality: Just as kicking a ball causes it to move, petting my cat may cause it to purr. Specificity: The petting must be directed at my cat specifically for it to purr, not at a different cat. Contiguity in time and space: Whenever I pet my cat, regardless of where it happens, the cat purrs. Co-occurrence: When I cease petting my cat, the purring stops.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: Student mentions 'specificity' but doesn't clearly explain distinctness - that B follows A but not other events. The example about petting 'my cat specifically' misses the key concept.
- Incorrect: Student doesn't mention consistency as a heuristic. While they describe co-occurrence and stopping behavior, they don't address that B should always follow A.
- Incorrect: Student doesn't mention plausibility as a heuristic or explain that common sense should make the causal relationship reasonable.
- Incorrect: Student mentions contiguity but incorrectly states it happens 'regardless of where it happens,' which contradicts the spatial contiguity requirement.
- Incorrect: Student doesn't mention similarity in cause and effect as a heuristic or explain that A and B should superficially resemble each other.

Score: 0.0

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Negativity bias plays a role by making us focus on negative emotional information. The availability heuristic also influences this by causing us to judge events that are more easily recalled as happening more often. When combined, these effects lead people to actively look for emotionally negative or morally shocking content, remember it more vividly, and therefore overestimate how frequently it occurs.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias and explains it as making us focus on negative emotional information, which aligns with the answer key's description of seeking out or placing more weight on negative information like morally outraged content.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the availability heuristic as judging events that are more easily recalled as happening more often, which matches the answer key's definition of estimating frequency based on ease of recall.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of how these biases work together - negativity bias causes attention to negative content which increases examples available for recall, leading to overestimation through availability heuristic. This captures the mechanism described in the answer key.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

In biological framework theories, it is understood that infectious agents like pathogenic microbes can be passed from one individual to another through shared clothing. However, in the social realm, there are no such pathogens causing unwanted behaviors, yet we mistakenly apply this biological perspective to social situations and behave accordingly.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that biological contagion concepts (infectious agents/pathogens transmitted through objects) are being inappropriately applied to the social domain where no actual biological transmission occurs, demonstrating understanding of how framework theories from different domains can be misapplied.

Score: 1.0

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A conspiracy theory is considered delusional only if it is not widely accepted; if many people believe in it, it is not regarded as delusional.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student only identifies the 'not commonly accepted' criterion but completely omits the 'irrational belief' component. According to the answer key, both conditions (irrational belief AND not commonly accepted) are required for a conspiracy theory to be considered delusional.

Score: 0.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

Dark triad traits include narcissism and a lack of trust in those in power.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies narcissism as a factor contributing to conspiratorial thinking, which matches one of the key factors from the answer key.
- Incorrect: While 'lack of trust in those in power' relates to conspiratorial thinking, it is not one of the specific cognitive and personality factors listed in the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student only provided two factors when the question asked for three, and the second factor doesn't match the answer key criteria.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you donâ€™t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

The anchoring and adjustment effect means that initial incorrect answers can strongly influence our judgments by serving as a reference point, and while our understanding of the correct answers is added to this reference, it is often not enough to fully change it. This can hinder the learning process.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes the anchoring and adjustment effect, which is a cognitive bias related to decision-making and judgments, but this is not the correct psychological mechanism. The answer key specifically requires source amnesia (forgetting the source of information and mistaking incorrect answers for correct ones) or related interference effects like proactive interference or the continued-influence effect.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

Repeated exposure leads people to develop a liking for and familiarity with things they frequently encounter.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the mere exposure effect, explaining that repeated exposure leads to increased liking and familiarity. This directly addresses the psychological mechanism politicians use when repeating messages to make them more attractive.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Mentally healthy individuals often exhibit a positivity bias, leading them to downplay the chances of negative events occurring. In contrast, those with major depressive disorder typically display little to no positivity bias, resulting in more realistic assessments of the likelihood of adverse outcomes.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people with major depressive disorder are more accurate at predicting negative events because they lack the positivity bias that leads mentally healthy individuals to be overly optimistic about avoiding bad outcomes.

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

When sensory information becomes less reliable, prior beliefs have a greater influence on perception.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when sensory information becomes less reliable, prior beliefs have greater influence on perception, which directly matches the key concept from the answer key.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You donâ€™t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other peopleâ€™s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

Level 1: Pre-conventional stages In this initial level, moral choices are straightforward and typically driven by the idea that actions are guided by the fear of punishment for wrongdoing. Level 2: Conventional stages At this stage, moral reasoning becomes more advanced, with decisions being judged based on personal feelings and adherence to laws and social rules. Level 3: Post-conventional stages Here, moral decisions are assessed according to universal ethical principles that apply broadly beyond specific laws or personal feelings.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the pre-conventional level and accurately describes it as being driven by fear of punishment for wrongdoing, which aligns with the answer key's description of obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the conventional level and describes it as involving adherence to laws and social rules, which matches the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the post-conventional level and describes it as being based on universal ethical principles that apply beyond specific laws, which aligns with the answer key's description of focusing on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model of past events enables us to clearly outline a sequence of causes, even if this sequence was not obvious before the decisions and their causes occurred. This process can make us believe that we had anticipated these causal chains from the beginning.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a causal model involves outlining a sequence of causes and their relationships, which aligns with the answer key's definition of a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student accurately explains how causal models contribute to hindsight bias by making us believe we anticipated the causal chains from the beginning, which corresponds to the answer key's point about events seeming more inevitable than they were.

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

When we acquire new information, we tend to remember it better if it matches the result of an event. Later, when reflecting on our previous decisions, what we have learned shapes our memory to align more closely with the outcome, reinforcing the feeling that we "always knew it."

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that newly learned information influences our ability to accurately recall past judgments, demonstrating understanding that we cannot avoid incorporating new knowledge when estimating what we previously thought. The explanation captures the essence of how learning creates hindsight bias by affecting memory reconstruction.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing decision style aims to get the best possible outcome from every choice and strives for perfection. In contrast, satisficing decision style is about selecting an option that is acceptable or adequate. Individuals with high levels of neuroticism are more prone to use a maximizing decision approach.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as aiming for the best possible outcome and striving for perfection, which aligns with 'trying to make the best choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as selecting an option that is acceptable or adequate, which matches 'making a good-enough choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that individuals with high neuroticism are more prone to use a maximizing decision approach, which matches the answer key's statement about adopting the maximizing decision style.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

I would analyze this situation using prospect theory, as it is a descriptive approach that better captures the realistic experiences of my students. I would acknowledge that students often have numerous and recurring questions, and a single professor may not have enough time to address them all. To address this, I would set up a public forum where questions are visible to everyone, reducing repetition and encouraging discussion. I would also consider that studentsâ€™ stress increases the longer it takes to receive their grades. Since this course is best assessed through open-ended questions and involves a large number of students, using an AI grader could be beneficial, though it is still experimental. Understanding that students might trust AI less than a professor, I would allow them to appeal against AI-assigned grades after they are released to ease their concerns.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement with the question by providing a thoughtful, multi-faceted approach that draws on course concepts (prospect theory), identifies practical constraints (time limitations, large class size), and proposes concrete solutions (public forum, AI grading with appeals process). The answer shows understanding of both theoretical frameworks and practical implementation challenges in educational settings.
