## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidtâ€™s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

According to Haidt's model, System 1 involves irrational decisions based on heuristics, while System 2 involves deliberate, rational thinking. System 1 tends to be the more dominant of the two.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes System 1 as 'irrational decisions based on heuristics' rather than intuitions or emotions as specified in the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies System 2 as involving 'deliberate, rational thinking' which matches the answer key's description of reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student correctly states that 'System 1 tends to be the more dominant of the two' which aligns with the answer key's requirement.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

The representativeness heuristic occurs when individuals estimate the likelihood of something being part of a category based on how closely it resembles typical members of that category.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process in this scenario.
- Correct: The student provides an accurate explanation of the representativeness heuristic, describing how it involves estimating likelihood of category membership based on resemblance to typical category members, which matches the key concept in the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring involves modifying a belief based on an initial reference point provided by early information. The primacy effect refers to the tendency to recall initial information more effectively than information encountered afterward. When forming impressions, the first impressions we form about a person are the most memorable and act as a foundation for our overall perception of them.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as involving an initial reference point from early information, which aligns with the answer key's definition of taking the first piece of information as a starting point.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as the tendency to recall initial information more effectively than later information, which matches the answer key's definition of better remembering the first piece of information.
- Correct: The student explains that first impressions are most memorable and act as a foundation for overall perception, which demonstrates understanding that both concepts involve overreliance on first information, though they don't explicitly state this commonality.

Score: 1.0

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion involves people steering clear of losses, while risk aversion involves people avoiding uncertain situations.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes loss aversion as 'steering clear of losses' but misses the key concept that losses are weighted more heavily than equivalent gains. The answer doesn't capture the asymmetric valuation between losses and gains.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that risk aversion involves avoiding uncertain situations, which aligns with the answer key's definition of preferring certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 0.5

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias refers to the tendency to exaggerate both the intensity and duration of emotional reactions. For example, individuals might overpredict how deeply and for how long they will feel sadness following a breakup.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as overestimating emotional reactions, mentioning both intensity and duration which captures the essence of overestimating the impact of future events on our feelings.
- Correct: The student provides a relevant example of breakup sadness that demonstrates understanding of how impact bias could prevent breakups, though they don't explicitly connect this to staying in unhappy relationships.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves predicting how a person will feel at a later time. When making end-of-life choices, individuals often assume that their present emotions will be the same in the future.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies affective forecasting as predicting future emotional states, which matches the answer key's definition of 'predictions about our own future emotional state.'
- Incorrect: The student mentions that people assume present emotions will remain the same in the future, but fails to address the key point about healthy people predicting they'd prefer to die when sick, yet not actually preferring death when they become ill.

Score: 0.5

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

Prospect theory suggests that individuals tend to downplay low probabilities. While low probabilities are seen as unlikely, extremely low probabilities are often treated as if they are zero.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student states that low probabilities are 'downplayed' which suggests underestimation, but the answer key indicates that merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that extremely low probabilities are treated as if they are zero, which aligns with the answer key's point that they are interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 0.5

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency to perceive losses as more significant than gains of the same magnitude. Losses carry a negative value.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that losses are perceived as more significant than equivalent gains, which captures the core concept that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities in prospect theory.

Score: 1.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory focuses solely on monetary amounts, while expected utility theory incorporates the utility derived from an outcome and takes into account loss aversion.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory focuses on monetary amounts while expected utility theory incorporates utility from outcomes, which aligns with the distinction between financial and non-financial values.
- Correct: The student mentions that expected utility theory takes into account loss aversion, which is a form of risk preference/bias consideration, satisfying the second key point about considering heuristics and biases versus risk aversion.

Score: 1.0

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesnâ€™t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

The expected value model involves selecting options based on the highest anticipated value. The expected utility model bases choices on the likelihood of an outcome multiplied by its perceived usefulness. The multi-attribute model evaluates various options by multiplying each attribute's utility by its assigned weight. Prospect theory suggests that people make decisions by considering gains and losses, tend to misjudge probabilities and utilities, exhibit loss aversion, display consistency effects, and are more prone to take risks in areas they believe they understand well.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as selecting options based on highest anticipated value, which aligns with the normative model concept from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes expected utility theory as choices based on likelihood multiplied by perceived usefulness, which matches the concept of probability times utility from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly explains multi-attribute utility theory as evaluating options by multiplying each attribute's utility by its weight, which directly matches the answer key description.
- Correct: The student provides a comprehensive description of prospect theory, mentioning gains/losses, probability misjudgment, loss aversion, and risk behavior, which captures the descriptive/behavioral nature and heuristics/biases aspects from the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease peopleâ€™s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

People often steer clear of risks when they feel unsure about the potential for losses, due to loss aversion.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that loss aversion makes people avoid risks, when the answer key indicates that loss aversion actually decreases risk aversion and can make people risk-seeking when trying to avoid potential losses.

Score: 0.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves acquiring a specific response or behavior. Classical conditioning links a stimulus to a response, while operant conditioning promotes learning by using rewards and punishments.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes conditioning as 'acquiring a specific response or behavior' but misses the key concept that conditioning is about learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that classical conditioning 'links a stimulus to a response' which captures the essence of learning associations when things happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student accurately describes operant conditioning as 'promoting learning by using rewards and punishments' which aligns with the answer key's concept of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory correlation occurs due to regression toward the mean, while illusory causation arises from causation heuristics.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's answer incorrectly describes both concepts. Illusory correlation is not about regression toward the mean but rather perceiving correlations that don't exist. Illusory causation is not about causation heuristics but about misinterpreting existing correlations as causal relationships. The answer fails to capture the key distinction that illusory correlation involves perceiving non-existent relationships while illusory causation involves misinterpreting existing correlations.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to â€˜properlyâ€™ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

Grasping the functioning of the Dutch health care system is a schema since it involves knowledge derived from perspectives and theoretical frameworks. In contrast, people's behavior at a birthday party is considered a script because it represents knowledge about a typical social event.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the Dutch healthcare system as a schema and provides a reasonable explanation that it involves knowledge and frameworks, which aligns with the concept of schemas as organized knowledge structures.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies birthday party behavior as a script and explains it as knowledge about a typical social event, which captures the essence of scripts as behavioral sequences for specific situations.

Score: 1.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

Behaviorism embraced the intentional stance by attempting to deduce individuals' intentions and beliefs from their observable actions.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies behaviorism with the intentional stance. Behaviorism actually rejected mental concepts like intentions and beliefs, focusing instead on physical stimulus-response mechanisms, which corresponds to the physical stance, not the intentional stance.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

Evolutionary psychologists take a design-oriented approach, viewing psychological processes based on their purposes.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance and accurately explains that they view psychological processes based on their purposes/functions, which aligns with the answer key's emphasis on considering processes in terms of their function.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Plausibility means it is reasonable for A to lead to B. Distinctiveness indicates that only A results in B. Consistency implies that A always brings about B. Similarity refers to the resemblance between A and B in terms of cause and effect. Co-occurrence in time and space means B occurs soon after A.

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies distinctiveness as only A resulting in B, which matches the answer key's explanation of B following A but not other events.
- Correct: Student correctly explains consistency as A always bringing about B, which aligns with the answer key's 'B always follows A'.
- Correct: Student correctly describes plausibility as it being reasonable for A to lead to B, matching the answer key's common sense explanation.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies co-occurrence in time and space, explaining B occurs soon after A, which captures the essence of contiguity in time and space from the answer key.
- Correct: Student correctly explains similarity as resemblance between A and B in terms of cause and effect, matching the answer key's description of superficial resemblance.

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

The negativity bias refers to people's tendency to focus on emotionally negative information, while the availability bias occurs when we judge the likelihood of an event based on how easily examples come to mind. The negativity bias leads individuals to seek out more morally upsetting content on social media because such content is emotionally charged. Meanwhile, the availability heuristic causes them to overestimate how common instances of moral outrage are on social media, since many examples are easily recalled.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias as the tendency to focus on negative information and mentions that it leads people to seek out morally upsetting content, which aligns with the answer key's description of seeking out or placing more weight on negative information like morally outraged content.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the availability heuristic as judging likelihood based on how easily examples come to mind, which matches the answer key's definition of estimating frequency or probability based on ease of recall.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of how these biases work together - negativity bias leads to seeking out morally upsetting content, and availability heuristic causes overestimation due to easily recalled examples, which effectively captures the causal relationship described in the answer key.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

Individuals apply understanding of characteristics from one area, such as biology, to a different area, like sociology.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that this involves applying concepts from one domain (biology) to another domain (sociology), which captures the essence of incorrectly transferring the biological concept of contagion to the social/psychological domain.

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

If it is typical for others to also believe in the conspiracy.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student only identifies one criterion (social acceptance) but misses the key distinction that a delusional conspiracy theory must be BOTH irrational AND not commonly accepted. The answer is incomplete as it doesn't mention the irrationality component.

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

Narcissism, perceiving order in chaos, attributing traits to individuals

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identified narcissism as one of the personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking.
- Correct: The student mentioned 'perceiving order in chaos' which accurately corresponds to 'seeing patterns in randomness' from the answer key.
- Incorrect: The phrase 'attributing traits to individuals' is too vague and doesn't clearly match any specific factor from the answer key, such as 'attributing agency where it does not exist'.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you donâ€™t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Belief perseverance is when a person continues to hold onto a false belief even after it has been disproven or corrected.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes belief perseverance correctly but this mechanism doesn't directly address how incorrect quiz answers interfere with learning. The answer key specifies source amnesia (forgetting the incorrect source) or proactive interference (old incorrect info interfering with new correct info) as the relevant mechanisms for this specific learning scenario.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

People usually prefer things they are familiar with.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the core concept of mere exposure effect - that people prefer things they are familiar with. While they don't use the specific term 'mere exposure,' they demonstrate understanding of the underlying psychological mechanism.

Score: 1.0

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Yes, individuals with major depressive disorder tend to have a more realistic assessment of the likelihood of negative events occurring to them, unlike others who exhibit a positivity bias, resulting in greater accuracy.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people with major depressive disorder are more accurate at predicting negative events, explains this is due to their more realistic assessment compared to others who show positivity bias, and concludes they have greater accuracy - all key points from the answer key.

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

As sensory information becomes less reliable, prior beliefs have a stronger impact on perception.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when sensory information becomes less reliable, prior beliefs have a stronger/greater impact on perception, which directly matches the key concept from the answer key.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You donâ€™t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other peopleâ€™s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

Pre-conventional morality relies on avoiding punishment and seeking rewards. Conventional morality is guided by the desire to avoid hurting others and to follow laws to maintain social order. Post-conventional morality involves recognizing universal ethical principles, which can lead individuals to challenge unjust laws.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes pre-conventional morality as focusing on avoiding punishment and seeking rewards, which matches the answer key's description of obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes conventional morality as being guided by avoiding hurting others and following laws to maintain social order, which aligns with the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies post-conventional morality as involving universal ethical principles and the willingness to challenge unjust laws, which demonstrates understanding of the focus on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

The causal model of past events refers to people's inclination to seek cause-and-effect relationships in events that have already occurred. In the case of hindsight bias, once the outcome is known, individuals tend to connect the preceding causes to the result and may believe they "knew it all along."

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a causal model involves seeking cause-and-effect relationships in past events, which aligns with the concept of a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student accurately explains how causal models contribute to hindsight bias by describing how people connect causes to known outcomes and develop a 'knew it all along' feeling, which reflects the inevitability aspect mentioned in the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

When a person tries to recall their previous opinion on a matter, they rely on probability signals. After learning the result of an event, these signals are subconsciously adjusted based on that outcome, causing the individual to mistakenly believe they had predicted it all along.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly explains that when recalling past judgments, people cannot avoid incorporating newly learned information (the outcome) which distorts their memory of what they previously believed, leading to hindsight bias. This captures the essence of the curse of knowledge concept from the answer key.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing is a type of perfectionism where an individual strives to choose the best possible option. Satisficing involves selecting a choice that is considered adequate or satisfactory. People with high levels of neuroticism are more prone to engaging in maximizing.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as striving to choose the best possible option, which aligns with the answer key's definition of 'trying to make the best choice.'
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as selecting a choice that is adequate or satisfactory, which matches the answer key's definition of 'making a good-enough choice.'
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people with high neuroticism are more prone to maximizing, which directly matches the answer key's requirement.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

To encourage students to actively engage with the material despite time and resource constraints, I would introduce weekly or unit-based quizzes. These assessments would focus on applying classroom theories to real-world situations or addressing current relevant problems. To motivate students, I would offer a reward, such as awarding an extra point on the final grade for achieving over 80% on all quizzes. A similar approach is used by Tassos Siampalis in a second-year psychology course.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement by proposing a specific, practical solution (weekly/unit-based quizzes with application focus), includes motivational elements (extra credit rewards), and references real-world implementation. The answer shows thoughtful consideration of the constraints mentioned (limited time/resources) by suggesting an efficient assessment method that doesn't require personalized feedback.
