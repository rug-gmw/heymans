## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

System 1 is the primary influence and functions in line with Haidt's social-intuitionist model, which proposes that moral judgments are largely intuitive, similar to a gut reaction, aligning with System 1's emotional basis.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 is associated with intuitive judgments and mentions its emotional basis, which aligns with the answer key's requirement that System 1 refers to intuitions/emotion.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention System 2 thinking or its role in reasoning/rational thought/deliberation, which is required by the answer key.
- Correct: The student clearly states that System 1 is the 'primary influence' in Haidt's model, correctly identifying that System 1 (intuition/emotion) is more dominant than System 2.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

Representation bias occurs when you assume something or someone fits a certain category based on how closely they match your mental image or stereotype of that category. For example, if a person appears to fit your idea of what a model looks like, you might automatically assume they are a model.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the heuristic as 'representation bias' which is essentially the same as the representativeness heuristic, just using slightly different terminology.
- Correct: The student accurately explains the concept by describing how we estimate likelihood of category membership based on resemblance to stereotypes, and provides a relevant example that demonstrates understanding.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring refers to the initial belief or assumption you hold at the start about something, serving as a baseline. Over time, you might modify this anchor based on new information. The primacy effect occurs when the first piece of information you encounter is the most memorable. Both concepts involve the way you form a first impression of something.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as an initial belief/assumption that serves as a baseline, which aligns with the concept of taking the first piece of information as a starting point.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as the first piece of information being the most memorable, which matches the answer key's definition of better remembering the first piece of information.
- Correct: The student identifies that both concepts involve forming first impressions, which demonstrates understanding that both relate to overreliance on initial information, though expressed in slightly different terms.

Score: 1.0

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

The distinction between loss aversion and risk aversion is that loss aversion refers to the tendency for losses to cause more discomfort than the pleasure gained from equivalent gains, while risk aversion describes people's preference for avoiding uncertainty and favoring certainty.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves weighing losses more heavily than equivalent gains, using the phrase 'losses cause more discomfort than the pleasure gained from equivalent gains' which captures the essence of the concept.
- Correct: The student accurately describes risk aversion as the preference for avoiding uncertainty and favoring certainty, which directly matches the answer key's definition.

Score: 1.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias refers to the tendency to exaggerate the consequences. Here, it means we predict our circumstances or emotions following a breakup to be worse than they actually are, which is why we remain in an unhappy relationship.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies impact bias as a tendency to exaggerate consequences, which aligns with overestimating the impact of future events on our feelings.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that impact bias prevents breakups by making people predict worse post-breakup emotions than reality, which matches the answer key's explanation.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting refers to our tendency to overpredict how we will feel in the future. We struggle to accurately anticipate our future emotional state because of focalism—we overlook the fact that other factors will also influence our feelings. We also tend to forget that emotions diminish over time and are affected by impact bias, meaning we exaggerate the effect something will have on us. This occurs in end-of-life decisions as well. When young, people often believe they have a clear idea of how they want to face the end of life, usually imagining it without pain and suffering. However, when that time arrives, perspectives change because they neglected to consider other influences, like family or small joys that can bring happiness. This is why it’s important to consider affective forecasting.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines affective forecasting as predictions about future emotional states, though they provide additional detail about biases like focalism and impact bias that enriches the basic definition.
- Correct: The student accurately captures the core concept that healthy people may have different preferences about end-of-life decisions when actually facing illness, explaining how perspectives change due to unconsidered factors like family and small joys.

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

We tend to undervalue small probabilities, often ignoring them altogether, and usually don't distinguish much between a 10% chance and a 0.01% chance.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student states that people 'undervalue small probabilities' and 'ignore them altogether', which contradicts the answer key that merely low probabilities (like 10%) are often overestimated according to prospect theory.
- Incorrect: While the student mentions not distinguishing between 10% and 0.01% probabilities, they don't specifically address that extremely low probabilities are interpreted as impossibilities, and their overall claim of undervaluing contradicts the overestimation aspect for merely low probabilities.

Score: 0.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion in prospect theory refers to the tendency for people to experience the pain of a loss more intensely than the pleasure of an equivalent gain. This means that losses have a stronger impact on our feelings than gains of the same size, indicating a negative utility associated with losses.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion means losses have a stronger impact than equivalent gains, which directly corresponds to the answer key's point that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. The student demonstrates understanding of the asymmetric weighting concept in prospect theory's utility framework.

Score: 1.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

The distinction between expected value theory and expected utility theory is that: 1) expected value theory focuses on monetary outcomes, while expected utility theory deals with subjective, non-financial outcomes. 2) expected value theory incorporates loss aversion, meaning that losses cause greater pain than the pleasure gained from equivalent gains.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory focuses on monetary outcomes while expected utility theory deals with subjective, non-financial outcomes, which matches the answer key's first point.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that expected value theory incorporates loss aversion. According to the answer key, expected value theory does not consider heuristics and biases, while expected utility theory considers risk aversion (not loss aversion).

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected value theory is applied when choices involve financial outcomes and probabilities, aiming to maximize long-term results. Expected utility theory is used when outcomes are non-financial and hold subjective value. Multi-attribute theory considers each option’s outcomes along with their respective values and weights. Prospect theory is similar to expected value theory but incorporates biases and heuristics, such as reference points and loss aversion.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as involving financial outcomes and probabilities, and mentions maximizing long-term results which aligns with the normative nature of the model.
- Correct: The student accurately describes expected utility theory as dealing with non-financial, subjective outcomes, which correctly distinguishes it from expected value theory.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that multi-attribute theory involves multiple attributes with values and weights, capturing the key components of this normative model.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that prospect theory is similar to expected value theory, when it should be similar to expected utility theory. However, they correctly identify that it incorporates biases and heuristics.

Score: 0.75

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

When individuals face a greater risk of losing something or experience strong loss aversion (where the pain of losing outweighs the pleasure of gaining), they are more likely to take risks and seek out risky options in an attempt to prevent the loss.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion leads people to take risks and seek risky options to avoid losses, which aligns with the key point that loss aversion decreases risk aversion and can make people risk-seeking.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning is learning through forming associations. The difference between classical and operant conditioning is that operant conditioning involves learning that one stimulus causes another because you connect the two stimuli. In contrast, classical conditioning is learning by associating an action with a punishment or reward.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as learning through forming associations, which aligns with the answer key's definition of learning associations through covariation.
- Incorrect: The student has reversed the definitions - they describe operant conditioning as connecting two stimuli (which is actually classical conditioning) rather than learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.
- Incorrect: The student describes classical conditioning as associating actions with rewards/punishments (which is actually operant conditioning) rather than learning associations when two things happen together in time and space.

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory correlation is perceiving a relationship between two things when none actually exists, while illusory causation is mistaken belief that one thing causes another when there is only a correlation between them.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that illusory correlation involves perceiving a relationship/correlation that doesn't actually exist, and that illusory causation involves mistakenly interpreting a correlation as a causal relationship. The definitions accurately capture the key distinction between these two concepts.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

A schema is an extensive framework of knowledge about a particular topic or system that helps you understand how the concepts function, such as the Dutch healthcare system. A script, on the other hand, consists of detailed information about a specific context or scenario, enabling us to anticipate events and act according to social norms, like at a birthday party.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the Dutch healthcare system as a schema and provides an accurate explanation that it represents a framework of knowledge about how concepts function within a system.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies birthday party behavior as a script and accurately explains that scripts contain detailed information about specific contexts that help us anticipate events and follow social norms.

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

Mechanical level of analysis focuses on physiological changes that occur alongside behavior, such as increased sweating during stress or a faster heart rate. This approach emphasizes measurable changes, which aligns with the behaviorist perspective.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the 'mechanical level' rather than the physical stance. Additionally, they describe physiological changes (sweating, heart rate) which would actually be more aligned with a biological/physiological approach rather than the behaviorist focus on observable stimulus-response relationships without reference to internal processes.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

The intentional level of analysis examines the purpose behind social behavior and emphasizes the social context of actions, such as wondering, "Why is someone ignoring me?"

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the intentional stance instead of the design stance. While the intentional stance does involve purpose, it focuses on beliefs and desires of agents, not evolutionary functions. The student also conflates this with social psychology rather than evolutionary psychology's focus on adaptive functions.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Plausible: this refers to how likely something is to occur based on your knowledge. When something seems very likely, we interpret it as a cause. For instance, knowing that cats enjoy being petted, when I pet my cat, she purrs. Distinctive: when a specific action takes place in a particular situation, we view it as causing the outcome. For example, if I pet my cat in a certain way and she starts to purr, I see that as a cause. Consistency: when an event happens repeatedly in the same situation, we consider it a cause. For example, whenever I pet my cat, she purrs. Cause and effect: when we observe a direct cause leading to an effect, we automatically assume causation. For example, when I kick the football, it begins to roll. Space and time: when something occurs at a particular time and place, we interpret it as causation. For instance, my cat wants to be petted and purrs every evening.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes 'distinctive' as a specific action in a particular situation, but misses the key concept that B should follow A but not follow other events (specificity/distinctness).
- Correct: The student correctly identifies consistency as when an event happens repeatedly in the same situation, matching the answer key's definition that B always follows A.
- Correct: The student correctly explains plausibility as something seeming likely based on knowledge/common sense, which aligns with the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the contiguity heuristic regarding time and space, explaining that events at particular times and places are interpreted as causation.
- Incorrect: The student describes 'cause and effect' as observing direct causation, but completely misses the similarity heuristic - that A and B should superficially resemble each other.

Score: 0.6

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Availability heuristic: We can quickly remember examples of people expressing outrage on social media, so we tend to believe this behavior is more common than it actually is. Negativity bias: We are more drawn to negative information, so because negative content captures more of our attention, we overestimate how frequently moral outrage occurs online.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias and explains that we are drawn to negative information, which captures our attention and leads to overestimation of moral outrage frequency.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies availability heuristic and explains that easily recalled examples of outrage on social media lead us to believe this behavior is more common than it actually is.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of how these biases work together - negativity bias draws attention to outraged content, creating more memorable examples that the availability heuristic then uses to overestimate frequency.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

Evaluative conditioning occurs when we steer clear of a neutral object due to a negative association linked to it. This can be understood through framework theory, which involves common knowledge about various areas that can overlap, leading to the effects observed in evaluative conditioning.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student discusses evaluative conditioning and framework theory overlap but fails to identify the key concept: that biological contagion principles are incorrectly applied to the social/psychological domain. The answer doesn't mention contagion from the biological domain being misapplied to other domains.

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A delusional conspiracy is neither culturally nor socially accepted. However, a non-delusional conspiracy theory can be accepted and might even be true.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that delusional conspiracy theories are not socially/culturally accepted, which aligns with the answer key's criterion of 'not commonly accepted.' The student also captures the essence that non-delusional conspiracy theories can be accepted, though they don't explicitly mention the 'irrational belief' component from the answer key.

Your answer:

- act like a man - displaying narcissism - lacking intelligence

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'being a man' as one of the factors contributing to conspiratorial thinking mentioned in the lecture.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies narcissism as a personality factor that contributes to conspiratorial thinking.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies low intelligence as a cognitive factor contributing to conspiratorial thinking.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

The continued influence effect occurs when an initial incorrect answer creates a first impression of the correct response. Even after being presented with the accurate information, the original wrong answer continues to affect your thinking, making it difficult to fully update your understanding and hindering the learning process.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the continued-influence effect as the psychological mechanism and provides an accurate explanation of how initial incorrect answers can persist and interfere with learning even after correct information is presented. This matches the alternative answer provided in the answer key.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

The mere exposure effect occurs because frequent repetition makes you more familiar with the information, leading you to believe it more and comprehend it better. This is why repeated exposure makes the information seem more appealing.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the mere exposure effect as the psychological mechanism and accurately explains that repeated exposure increases familiarity, which makes information more appealing. The explanation demonstrates understanding of how familiarity leads to preference, which is the core principle of mere exposure.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Major depressive disorder can lead individuals to make more accurate predictions because they have a reduced positivity bias. While healthy individuals often underestimate the likelihood of negative events occurring to them, those with depression typically exhibit little to no positivity bias, allowing them to make more precise forecasts.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people with major depressive disorder are more accurate at predicting negative events due to reduced positivity bias (equivalent to reduced optimism bias). The answer accurately explains that healthy individuals underestimate negative event likelihood while depressed individuals show little bias, leading to more accurate predictions.

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

The ideal-observer model proposes that prior beliefs have a greater impact on perception as the reliability of sensory information diminishes.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that prior beliefs have greater impact/influence on perception when sensory information reliability decreases, which directly matches the key concept in the answer key.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

Pre-conventional stage: This stage typically occurs in childhood, where morality is guided by the desire to avoid punishment and gain rewards, focusing on self-interest. Conventional stage: At this point, morality is influenced by the need for social approval or adherence to authority and established rules. Post-conventional stage: Here, morality is based on understanding social contracts, such as fairness in games where cheating is socially unacceptable even if unspoken, or universal ethical principles like human rights. Not everyone reaches this stage.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the pre-conventional level as focusing on avoiding punishment and gaining rewards, driven by self-interest, which matches the answer key's description.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as being influenced by social approval and adherence to authority/rules, which aligns with the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly describes the post-conventional level as based on social contracts and universal ethical principles like human rights, which matches the answer key's description of abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model involves identifying a cause-and-effect relationship between events. Hindsight bias is the tendency to believe, after an event has occurred, that we had predicted it all along, even though we couldn't have known it beforehand. This leads us to overestimate our ability to foresee outcomes. When we interpret events as having a causal link after the fact, it becomes easier to claim we anticipated the outcome, despite not recognizing or understanding the cause at the time.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a causal model involves cause-and-effect relationships between events, which aligns with the answer key's definition of a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student explains how causal models contribute to hindsight bias by making outcomes seem more predictable after the fact ('easier to claim we anticipated the outcome'), which matches the answer key's point about events seeming more inevitable than they were.

Score: 1.0

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Hindsight bias is the sensation of believing you knew something all along, even though you couldn't have at the time. It involves overestimating your ability to have predicted an outcome. When we gain new information, our understanding is revised, making it difficult to accurately recall our original predictions, which leads us to think we always knew the result. This process of learning plays a role in creating hindsight bias.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly explains that learning new information makes it difficult to accurately recall original predictions/likelihood judgments, which is the core mechanism of how learning contributes to hindsight bias. While they don't use the exact phrase 'curse of knowledge,' they capture the essential concept that newly acquired knowledge interferes with our ability to remember our past state of knowledge.

Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing involves striving to make the optimal choice, while satisficing means aiming for a decision that is good enough. Individuals with a neurotic personality trait are more likely to use a maximizing decision approach.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as 'striving to make the optimal choice,' which aligns with the answer key's definition of 'trying to make the best choice.'
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as 'aiming for a decision that is good enough,' which matches the answer key's definition of 'making a good-enough choice.'
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that individuals with high neuroticism are more likely to adopt a maximizing decision style, which matches the answer key exactly.

Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

I believe Slimstampen is an excellent tool for encouraging students to engage actively with the content. In the courses, the Slimstampen program can grade students with a star once they complete the slimstampen before each lecture. This approach ensures they are consistently prepared for class, and by fully finishing the slimstampen for every lecture, they earn the opportunity to skip some exam questions since they've already completed the material.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement with the question by proposing a specific, practical solution using Slimstampen for active learning. They address the constraint of limited time/resources by suggesting an automated system that provides incentives (stars, exam question exemptions) for consistent preparation, which would encourage active engagement without requiring personalized grading from the instructor.
