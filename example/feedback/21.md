## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

System I and II relate to how we form moral judgments. Initially, we often have an intuitive moral reaction through system I. Afterward, system II becomes involved as we engage in more deliberate and logical moral reasoning. In the social-intuitionist model, system I plays a more prominent role.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 involves intuitive moral reactions, which aligns with the answer key's requirement that System 1 refers to intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student correctly describes System 2 as involving 'deliberate and logical moral reasoning,' which matches the answer key's requirement that System 2 refers to reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student clearly states that 'system I plays a more prominent role,' which correctly identifies System 1 as more dominant than System 2 according to Haidt's model.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

Representativeness refers to the tendency to classify people or objects into categories based on how similar they appear to typical members of that group. For example, if someone looks like a supermodel, we assume they must be one.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive mechanism in this scenario.
- Correct: The student accurately explains the representativeness heuristic as classifying based on similarity to typical group members, and provides a relevant example that demonstrates understanding of how we estimate likelihood based on resemblance to stereotypes.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring occurs when your initial impression of something has the strongest impact, even though you may later revise your opinion based on new information. This initial impression remains the most influential. Similarly, the primacy effect refers to the tendency to remember the first item in a sequence best. Both concepts emphasize the significance of first impressions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as the tendency for initial information to have the strongest impact and remain influential, which aligns with the answer key's definition of taking the first piece of information as the starting point.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as the tendency to remember the first item in a sequence best, which matches the answer key's definition of better remembering the first piece of information.
- Correct: The student identifies that both concepts emphasize the significance of first impressions, which correctly captures the commonality of overreliance on the first piece of information stated in the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the natural tendency to avoid losing what we currently possess. In contrast, risk aversion is focused more on the reluctance to take risks or engage in uncertain actions, rather than on the ownership of money or assets.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes loss aversion as avoiding losing current possessions, but misses the key concept that losses are weighted more heavily than equivalent gains. The answer focuses on ownership rather than the asymmetric valuation of losses versus gains.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies risk aversion as reluctance to take risks or engage in uncertain actions, which aligns with the preference for certainty over uncertainty stated in the answer key.

Score: 0.5

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Exaggerating how badly you'll feel and the effect it will have. This can prevent you from ending unhappy relationships, as you believe you'll feel awful when that might not actually happen.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies impact bias as exaggerating future emotional effects, which captures the essence of overestimating the impact of future events on feelings.
- Correct: The student clearly explains how impact bias prevents breakups by making people believe they'll feel awful, which aligns with overestimating how bad a breakup will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves making choices based on predictions about future emotions. This concept is especially significant in end-of-life decisions, such as those involving Alzheimer's disease. Individuals might strongly prefer euthanasia over prolonged caregiving due to their anticipation of the distress associated with cognitive deterioration.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that affective forecasting involves predictions about future emotions, which aligns with the answer key's definition of 'predictions about our own future emotional state.'
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of the key concept by providing a relevant example showing how healthy people might predict preferring death (euthanasia) when anticipating future illness (Alzheimer's), which matches the answer key's point about healthy people predicting they'll prefer to die when sick.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

People tend to overvalue small probabilities, but when it comes to extremely low probabilities, prospect theory treats them as nearly impossible.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people overvalue (overestimate) small probabilities, which aligns with the answer key's point about merely low probabilities being overestimated.
- Correct: The student accurately states that extremely low probabilities are treated as 'nearly impossible' under prospect theory, which matches the answer key's point about extremely low probabilities being interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

People perceive losses as significantly more influential and damaging compared to how they view gains as beneficial. This indicates that the satisfaction of avoiding a 5-euro loss is greater than the satisfaction derived from gaining 5 euros.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly explains that losses are perceived as more influential than equivalent gains, which demonstrates understanding that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities in prospect theory's value function.

Score: 1.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected utility measures loss aversion and can be applied beyond just financial choices.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected utility theory can be applied beyond financial choices, which aligns with the answer key point about expected utility dealing with non-financial values versus expected value theory dealing only with financial values.
- Correct: The student mentions loss aversion, which is a behavioral bias/heuristic that expected utility theory considers, matching the answer key point about expected utility theory considering risk aversion and biases versus expected value theory not considering heuristics and biases.

Score: 1.0

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected value theory is a normative approach to financial decision-making that calculates outcomes by multiplying their values by the probability of occurrence. Expected utility theory, also a normative framework for financial decisions but applicable in other contexts as well, combines subjective expected utility with the probability of outcomes. Multi-attribute utility theory evaluates options based on multiple characteristics—such as cost and mileage when purchasing a car—by multiplying the ratings of these attributes by their corresponding utilities. Prospect theory incorporates heuristics and biases into decision-making models, determining the value of a choice by multiplying variables v and w.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as a normative model involving financial outcomes and probabilities, capturing the essential concept.
- Correct: The student correctly describes expected utility theory as normative and applicable beyond financial contexts, mentioning subjective utility and probabilities.
- Incorrect: The student mentions multiple attributes but incorrectly describes the process as multiplying ratings by utilities rather than explaining that each attribute has both utility and weight.
- Incorrect: While the student mentions heuristics and biases, they fail to identify prospect theory as descriptive/behavioral and provide an unclear explanation about multiplying variables v and w.

Score: 0.5

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Individuals who are more sensitive to losses generally tend to avoid risks more.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student answer states that loss-sensitive individuals avoid risks more, but the answer key indicates the opposite - that loss aversion can actually decrease risk aversion and make people risk-seeking when trying to avoid potential losses.

Score: 0.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves forming a connection between a stimulus and a response. Classical conditioning usually happens naturally as a result of a triggering event, while operant conditioning is deliberate and involves several steps to actively associate a stimulus with a response.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that conditioning involves forming connections/associations, which aligns with the key concept of learning associations through covariation.
- Incorrect: The student describes classical conditioning as happening 'naturally as a result of a triggering event' but misses the core concept that it's about learning associations when two things happen together in time and space.
- Incorrect: The student describes operant conditioning as 'deliberate' association of stimulus with response, but fails to capture the key concept that it's about learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation involves mistakenly thinking that one event is causing another, whereas illusory correlation is the false belief that two events happening together are connected when they actually are not.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly distinguishes between illusory causation (mistaking correlation for causation) and illusory correlation (perceiving a relationship between uncorrelated variables). The explanation captures the essence of both concepts accurately, though using slightly different wording than the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

The schema refers to the functioning of the Dutch healthcare system, while the script describes the expected behavior at a birthday party. Schemas are structures for social interactions, and a script is a specific type of schema that outlines typical behaviors in particular social contexts, like a birthday party.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly defines schemas as 'structures for social interactions' when schemas are actually cognitive frameworks for organizing knowledge and understanding relationships between concepts, not specifically social structures.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script and accurately describes scripts as outlining typical behaviors in specific social contexts.

Score: 0.5

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

Mechanical, as it seeks to understand how something operates and functions.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the stance as 'mechanical' rather than 'physical stance.' While their reasoning about understanding operations and functions shows some understanding of systematic analysis, they missed the key point that behaviorists adopted the physical stance by focusing on stimulus-response processes and rejecting mental/intentional explanations.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

Deliberate. It examines the reasons behind the actions of people and animals, focusing on the purpose or motive driving their behavior, similar to questioning: Why does this occur?

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the stance as 'deliberate' rather than the design stance. While they correctly understand that evolutionary psychology focuses on purpose and function ('why does this occur?'), they fail to connect this to Dennett's specific terminology of the design stance, which is what the question asks for.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Negativity bias refers to our tendency to focus more on negative information and engage with it more frequently. Confirmation bias leads us to give greater importance to information that supports our existing beliefs. Therefore, when we use social media, we naturally pay more attention to negative content, which also reinforces our confirmation bias.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias and provides an accurate definition that aligns with the answer key's explanation of seeking out or placing more weight on negative information.
- Incorrect: The student identifies confirmation bias instead of the availability heuristic as the second bias. While confirmation bias is a real cognitive bias, it doesn't explain the mechanism by which we overestimate frequency based on memorable examples.
- Incorrect: The student doesn't explain the correct mechanism linking the two biases. The answer key requires understanding that negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through availability heuristic leads to overestimation of frequency.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

In biology, germs and diseases are known to be contagious, so infected objects or individuals should be avoided. However, when people mistakenly apply this biological concept to areas like emotions, it can result in the mistaken belief in magical contagion, even though it is understood that social status and personality traits cannot be spread in the same way.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that biological contagion concepts are being inappropriately applied to the social/psychological domain, explaining how the biological understanding of disease transmission is mistakenly extended to non-biological properties like social status and personality traits.

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A delusional conspiracy entails beliefs that fall beyond the limits of typical thinking and are not accepted by mainstream society. In contrast, a non-delusional conspiracy theory stays within those accepted boundaries.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that delusional conspiracy theories are both irrational ('beyond the limits of typical thinking') and not commonly accepted ('not accepted by mainstream society'), while non-delusional theories stay within accepted boundaries. This matches the answer key's criteria of irrationality plus lack of common acceptance.

Score: 1.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

- An emotion of ethical indignation - Inclined towards loyalty to one's own group - Distrustful of those in power

Feedback:

- Incorrect: Ethical indignation is not listed among the cognitive and personality factors in the answer key that contribute to conspiratorial thinking.
- Incorrect: Group loyalty inclination is not mentioned in the answer key as one of the factors contributing to conspiratorial thinking.
- Incorrect: Distrust of those in power is not included in the answer key's list of cognitive and personality factors for conspiratorial thinking.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Anchoring effects occur when our initial impression or thought remains the most prominent in our mind, even when new information suggests otherwise.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes anchoring effects, which is a cognitive bias about being influenced by initial information in decision-making contexts. However, the answer key requires explanation of source amnesia (forgetting the source of information and mistaking incorrect answers for correct ones) or proactive interference (initial incorrect answers interfering with later correct answers). Anchoring effects does not accurately describe the psychological mechanism by which incorrect quiz answers interfere with learning.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

Through cues, when we frequently hear a phrase linked to someone positively, repeated exposure to that phrase subtly shapes our perception of the person without seeming manipulative or undermining independent thought.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions 'repeated exposure' which relates to the correct concept, but fails to identify the specific psychological mechanism of mere exposure effect or illusory-truth effect. The answer focuses on association and perception shaping rather than the core principle that familiarity increases preference or perceived truthfulness.

Score: 0.0

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

No, it doesn't.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: While the student correctly answered 'No' to the question, they failed to provide the essential explanation that people with major depressive disorder are actually MORE accurate at making predictions because they show reduced optimism bias compared to non-depressed individuals.

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

When the evidence is uncertain or unreliable, prior beliefs have a stronger impact on the posterior, making it resemble the prior more than it would if the sensory data were dependable.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when sensory evidence is unreliable, prior beliefs have a stronger influence on perception (the posterior). The answer demonstrates understanding that unreliable sensory data leads to greater reliance on expectations/priors, which matches the key concept in the answer key.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

Pre-conventional: This stage focuses on consequences rather than distinguishing right from wrong and is primarily self-focused, depending on punishment and reward. Conventional: Moral reasoning here is guided by conformity to laws and consideration for others. Post-conventional: At this level, there is recognition that moral principles can sometimes conflict, with morality itself being the highest priority.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the pre-conventional level as focusing on consequences, punishment, and reward, which aligns with the answer key's description of obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as being guided by conformity to laws and consideration for others, which matches the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the post-conventional level as recognizing conflicts between moral principles and prioritizing morality itself, which aligns with the answer key's description of focusing on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

When an incident happens and a cause is identified, we can later say "we could see it coming" because a comparable cause-and-effect relationship existed during a previous occurrence of the incident.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student focuses on identifying causes after incidents occur, but doesn't capture that a causal model is a coherent narrative that connects and relates past events in a structured way.
- Incorrect: While the student mentions saying 'we could see it coming,' they don't explain how causal models make events seem more inevitable than they actually were, which is the key mechanism of hindsight bias.

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

After learning something and realizing it seems obvious in hindsight, it's difficult to picture a time when we didn't understand it. This leads to the belief that "they always knew" from the beginning.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that newly learned information cannot be avoided when estimating past judgments, explaining how knowledge acquired makes it difficult to recall our previous state of ignorance, which is the core mechanism of hindsight bias.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing involves selecting the optimal option in every scenario, while satisficing means choosing the best option based on the current conditions. A highly neurotic person is more likely to use a maximizing approach because of their perfectionist tendencies.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies maximizing as selecting the optimal/best option, which aligns with 'trying to make the best choice' from the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student describes satisficing as 'choosing the best option based on current conditions' rather than making a 'good-enough choice,' which misses the key concept that satisficing involves settling for adequate rather than optimal solutions.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that highly neurotic individuals are more likely to adopt maximizing decision style and provides appropriate reasoning about perfectionist tendencies.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

At the beginning of each lecture, I would administer a brief quiz on the material assigned for study. Although the quiz carries no penalties, it provides an initial assessment of everyone's understanding of the topic. At the conclusion of the lecture, the same quiz is given again to measure the students' progress. Repeating this process for every lecture, and making the quizzes accessible online, helps students learn through repetition, with specific words in the questions prompting near-instant responses.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement by proposing a specific, practical solution using pre- and post-lecture quizzes. The approach addresses the constraint of limited time/resources by using automated online quizzes that don't require personalized grading, while promoting active engagement through repetition and self-assessment. The strategy shows thoughtful consideration of how to balance educational effectiveness with resource limitations.
