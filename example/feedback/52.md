## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidtâ€™s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

System 1 refers to the instinctive or intuitive response you have when making decisions, while System 2 involves the logical thinking that comes after that initial intuition. According to this model, System 1 tends to play the more dominant role.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies System 1 as 'instinctive or intuitive response' which aligns with the answer key's requirement for System 1 to refer to intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies System 2 as 'logical thinking' which corresponds to the answer key's requirement for System 2 to refer to reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student correctly states that 'System 1 tends to play the more dominant role' which matches the answer key's requirement that System 1 thinking is more dominant than System 2.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

The representativeness heuristic occurs when you assume someone is a fashion model simply because they fit the typical image of one, while ignoring other important factors like the actual prevalence of models.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive bias in this scenario.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of the representativeness heuristic by explaining that it involves assuming category membership based on resemblance to a stereotype ('fit the typical image') while noting the neglect of base rates ('ignoring other important factors like the actual prevalence of models').

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring refers to the influence a prior impression has on your estimates about something. For instance, if you're asked to guess the height of the A-kerk in Groningen and you see the number 73 beforehand, that number serves as an anchor affecting your estimate. The primacy effect involves giving undue importance to the initial impression of something and recalling that first impression more easily. Both effects share the tendency to assign excessive significance to an initial impression.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as using a prior/first piece of information as a starting point for estimates, demonstrated with a clear example of the number 73 influencing height estimates.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as giving undue importance to initial impressions and better recalling first impressions, which aligns with the tendency to better remember first information.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both effects share the tendency to assign excessive significance to initial impressions, which matches the overreliance on first information described in the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion is the desire to avoid losing something, which may involve taking risks and does not always mean avoiding risk altogether, while risk aversion is the preference to avoid taking risks.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's definition of loss aversion as 'desire to avoid losing something' is incomplete and misses the key concept that losses are weighted more heavily than equivalent gains. The student also incorrectly suggests loss aversion may involve taking risks, which confuses the concept.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies risk aversion as the preference to avoid taking risks, which aligns with the answer key's definition of preferring certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 0.5

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias refers to the tendency to overpredict the emotional effects of future events. For example, it might stop a person from ending a relationship because they believe they will never emotionally recover and that the consequences of breaking up will be worse than staying in an unhappy partnership, even though this is not always the case.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as the tendency to overpredict emotional effects of future events, which aligns with overestimating the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Correct: The student accurately explains how impact bias prevents breakups by describing that people believe they will never recover and that consequences will be worse than staying, which demonstrates understanding that people overestimate how bad a breakup will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves anticipating your future emotional reactions. This is particularly relevant in end-of-life planning, such as preparing a will that outlines your wishes for when you become chronically ill or may seek euthanasia. It's necessary to forecast your feelings about these issues ahead of time, for moments when you might no longer be able to make such choices yourself.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies affective forecasting as predicting future emotional reactions/states, which aligns with the answer key's definition of 'predictions about our own future emotional state.'
- Incorrect: While the student mentions end-of-life planning, they don't capture the key insight that healthy people may predict preferring death when sick, but actually may not prefer to die when they become sick - missing the core bias/discrepancy concept.

Score: 0.5

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

They tend to overestimate both low and extremely low probabilities, with the overestimation being more pronounced for extremely low probabilities.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that low probabilities are overestimated, which aligns with the answer key point about merely low probabilities being often overestimated.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that extremely low probabilities are overestimated with more pronounced effect, while the answer key indicates that extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities (underestimated or ignored).

Score: 0.5

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

It shows that individuals value avoiding losses more than obtaining gains, leading them to take greater action to avoid losing than to achieve a gain.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion means individuals value avoiding losses more than obtaining gains, which accurately reflects that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities in prospect theory's value function.

Score: 1.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory ignores personal experiences, while expected utility theory assigns varying importance to different factors. Additionally, expected utility theory acknowledges that individuals may lack all the information needed for fully rational decisions, unlike expected value theory.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions that expected value theory ignores personal experiences while expected utility theory assigns varying importance to different factors, but this doesn't capture the key distinction that expected value theory deals only with financial values whereas expected utility theory deals with both financial and non-financial values.
- Incorrect: The student discusses information limitations and rational decision-making, but fails to identify the core difference that expected value theory doesn't consider heuristics and biases while expected utility theory specifically considers risk aversion.

Score: 0.0

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesnâ€™t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

The expected value model determines the anticipated outcome of a decision by including probability. The expected utility model is similar but incorporates personal preferences when evaluating utility. The Multi-Attribute Utility model considers several factors simultaneously, useful for decisions involving multiple criteria. Prospect theory describes how people perceive value in terms of gains and losses, favoring certainty over uncertainty, and suggests that the value function is nonlinear.

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies expected value theory as involving probability and anticipated outcomes, which aligns with the normative model for choosing between options with probabilistic financial outcomes.
- Correct: Student accurately describes expected utility theory as similar to expected value but incorporating personal preferences/subjective utility, which matches the answer key's distinction about non-financial, subjective outcomes.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies multi-attribute utility theory as considering multiple factors/criteria simultaneously, which corresponds to the answer key's description of multiple attributes with utilities and weights.
- Correct: Student demonstrates understanding of prospect theory as a descriptive model involving gains/losses, certainty preferences, and nonlinear value function, which aligns with the behavioral/descriptive nature and consideration of heuristics and biases mentioned in the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease peopleâ€™s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Loss aversion causes individuals to be more cautious with risk, as they are willing to take extra measures to avoid losing.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that loss aversion makes people more cautious and risk averse. The answer key indicates that loss aversion actually decreases risk aversion and can make people risk seeking when trying to avoid losses.

Score: 0.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves understanding the relationship between two connected variables. Classical conditioning is learning this connection through punishment or rewards, while operant conditioning is learning it because one variable consistently follows another.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as involving relationships between variables, which aligns with learning associations through covariation.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly describes classical conditioning as involving punishment or rewards, when it actually involves learning associations between stimuli that occur together in time and space.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly describes operant conditioning as learning when one variable follows another, when it actually involves learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation involves incorrectly assigning a cause to an effect, while illusory correlation refers to wrongly connecting two things as related.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that illusory causation involves incorrectly inferring causal relationships and illusory correlation involves perceiving relationships that don't exist. While the wording is more informal than the answer key, the core distinction between misinterpreting correlation as causation versus perceiving non-existent correlations is accurately captured.

Score: 1.0

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to â€˜properlyâ€™ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

Both are types of schemas since they represent general concepts that aid memory, but knowing the appropriate behavior at a birthday party is specifically a script, which is a type of schema focused on expected actions in typical situations like a supermarket or a birthday party.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly identifies that knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, but fails to clearly identify the Dutch healthcare system as a schema. They mention both are 'types of schemas' which is technically correct but doesn't distinguish between the two examples as required.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script and provides an accurate explanation that scripts involve expected actions in typical situations.

Score: 0.5

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

The RAFT level of analysis involves revising ideas after receiving feedback and selecting the most effective option, based on the understanding that the mind cannot be directly measured, so the optimal approach is to focus on how stimuli influence behavior.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies 'RAFT level of analysis' instead of Dennett's physical stance, and doesn't demonstrate understanding that behaviorists focused on physical stimulus-response processes rather than mental states.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

You seek evidence that supports the idea that A causes B, evidence that contradicts it, evidence that is directly related (A causes B), evidence that is unrelated (C causes B), and evidence that is somewhat related (A occasionally causes B).

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student does not mention distinctness/specificity. Instead, they describe seeking different types of evidence, which doesn't match the heuristic about B following A but not other events.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention consistency. The phrase 'A occasionally causes B' actually contradicts the consistency heuristic which requires B to always follow A.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention plausibility or common sense as a heuristic for judging causation.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention contiguity in time and space as a heuristic for determining causation.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention similarity between cause and effect as a heuristic for judging causation.

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

This involves base rate neglect and the availability heuristic, as seeing mainly morally outraged individuals on social media can distort oneâ€™s perception of the overall consensus. The morally outraged may actually represent a smaller portion of the population than assumed, but their prominence on social media leads people to overestimate their true numbers.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies 'base rate neglect' instead of 'negativity bias' as one of the two primary biases. While base rate neglect can be related to estimation errors, the answer key specifically requires negativity bias as the mechanism that draws our attention to morally outraged content.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the availability heuristic as one of the two biases and demonstrates understanding that it involves estimating frequency based on easily recalled examples from social media.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of how these biases work together to create overestimation, explaining that prominence of morally outraged content on social media leads to overestimating their actual numbers in the population, which captures the essential mechanism described in the answer key.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

This can be understood through the negativity bias, where negative aspects are given greater importance, and if you have a dislike for someone, that feeling may extend to the things associated with that person.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student explains the phenomenon through negativity bias and association but fails to address the core concept from the answer key: that this represents an incorrect application of biological contagion concepts to the social/psychological domain. The answer doesn't mention framework theories or domain-specific knowledge transfer.

Score: 0.0

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A delusional conspiracy involves unrealistic fantasies that have no basis in reality, whereas a non-delusional conspiracy theory revolves around scenarios that are more plausible, like theories about government control.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student focuses on plausibility/realism but misses the key criterion that a conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both irrational AND not commonly accepted. The answer doesn't address the 'commonly accepted' component, which is essential to the distinction according to the answer key.

Score: 0.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

seeking control, experiencing moral indignation, and supporting populism.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: Seeking control is not listed among the cognitive and personality factors in the answer key. The answer key focuses on pattern recognition, paranormal beliefs, agency attribution, and other specific cognitive biases.
- Incorrect: Experiencing moral indignation is not mentioned in the answer key as one of the cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking.
- Incorrect: Supporting populism is not included in the answer key's list of cognitive and personality factors. The key emphasizes factors like narcissism, gender, intelligence level, and analytical thinking.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you donâ€™t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

by means of the availability heuristic.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The availability heuristic refers to judging probability based on how easily examples come to mind, which doesn't explain how incorrect answers interfere with learning correct information. The answer key requires mechanisms like source amnesia (forgetting the source of information) or proactive interference (old information interfering with new), not a judgment heuristic.

Score: 0.0

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

Familiarity bias occurs when a message is repeated often, making it more recognizable, and people are more inclined to believe information that seems familiar.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the psychological mechanism as familiarity bias, which is essentially the same concept as mere exposure effect - both describe how repeated exposure to information makes it more familiar and therefore more believable or attractive. The explanation accurately captures how repetition leads to increased recognition and acceptance.

Score: 1.0

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Certainly.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student provided no substantive answer to the question about whether major depressive disorder affects accuracy in predicting negative events. The response 'Certainly' does not address the key point that people with MDD are more accurate due to reduced optimism bias.

Score: 0.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

The impact of previous beliefs grows stronger.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that prior beliefs have increased influence when sensory information is less reliable, which directly matches the key concept from the answer key.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You donâ€™t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other peopleâ€™s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

Pre-conventional level: determining right and wrong based on avoiding punishment and seeking rewards. Conventional level: making moral judgments by adhering to laws and established rules. Post-conventional level: reasoning morally based on principles of justice, independent of whether something is legally allowed, guided by an internal moral compass.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the pre-conventional level as focusing on avoiding punishment and seeking rewards, which matches the answer key's description of obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as adhering to laws and established rules, which aligns with the answer key's focus on social norms, though it doesn't explicitly mention other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the post-conventional level as based on principles of justice and internal moral compass, independent of legal rules, which matches the answer key's description of focus on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

The causal model suggests that individuals seek to identify cause-and-effect relationships, making it easier to connect an event's cause to its outcome once the result is known, which can lead to hindsight bias.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a causal model involves cause-and-effect relationships and connecting events, which aligns with the concept of a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student accurately explains how causal models contribute to hindsight bias by making it easier to connect causes to outcomes once the result is known, which captures the essence of events seeming more inevitable than they were.

Score: 1.0

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Learning reveals the result of something, leading people to believe they predicted it all along, even though they actually did not.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly identifies that learning about outcomes leads people to believe they predicted them, but fails to explain the key mechanism: that when estimating past likelihood judgments, people cannot avoid incorporating newly learned information, which distorts their memory of what they previously thought.

Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

They probably use a maximizing decision style, which aims to make the best possible choice. In contrast, a satisficing decision style seeks an outcome that is merely satisfactory.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as aiming to make the best possible choice, which aligns with the answer key's definition of 'trying to make the best choice.'
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as seeking an outcome that is merely satisfactory, which corresponds to the answer key's 'making a good-enough choice.'
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that high neuroticism leads to adopting a maximizing decision style, matching the answer key's requirement.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

I would incorporate nudges, such as informative prompts during the first lecture, explaining to students that those who actively participate with the material have a higher likelihood of passing the exam.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement by proposing a specific, practical solution (using nudges and informative prompts) that addresses the constraint of limited time and resources while encouraging active participation. The approach shows understanding of behavioral concepts and their application to educational settings.
