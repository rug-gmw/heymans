## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

Haidt's theory suggests that moral judgments rely largely on intuition instead of deliberate reasoning. Intuition stems from system 1 thinking, which is fast and driven by instinct. In contrast, reasoning comes from system 2 thinking, which is slower, more analytical, and requires conscious effort. Therefore, system 1 thinking plays the primary role.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 thinking refers to intuition and describes it as 'fast and driven by instinct,' which aligns with the answer key's requirement that System 1 relates to intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student accurately identifies that System 2 thinking refers to reasoning, describing it as 'slower, more analytical, and requires conscious effort,' which matches the answer key's requirement for reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student clearly states that 'system 1 thinking plays the primary role' and that 'moral judgments rely largely on intuition instead of deliberate reasoning,' correctly identifying System 1 as dominant according to Haidt's model.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

The representative heuristic involves estimating the probability that someone belongs to a certain group by how closely they resemble members of that group. If Y resembles X, then Y is assumed to be X, often ignoring the actual base-rate information.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive bias, though with a minor spelling variation ('representative' instead of 'representativeness').
- Correct: The student provides an accurate explanation of the heuristic, describing how probability estimates are based on resemblance to group members and correctly mentions the tendency to ignore base-rate information, which demonstrates a solid understanding of the concept.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring serves as the foundation for the overall impression, with the anchor being the initial impression. According to the primacy effect, first impressions significantly shape the overall perception because they are frequently recalled, making the initial impression a crucial component of the overall evaluation. Since the anchor is the first impression, it greatly influences the overall impression.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as related to initial impressions serving as a foundation, which aligns with the concept of taking the first piece of information as a starting point.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as first impressions being frequently recalled and significantly shaping overall perception, which matches the tendency to better remember first information.
- Correct: The student recognizes that both concepts involve the first impression/anchor greatly influencing overall evaluation, demonstrating understanding of their common overreliance on first information.

Score: 1.0

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency for individuals to consider losses as more significant than equivalent gains. Risk aversion describes the preference for certainty rather than facing uncertainty.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves weighing losses more heavily than equivalent gains, which matches the answer key definition.
- Correct: The student accurately describes risk aversion as the preference for certainty over uncertainty, which aligns with the answer key definition.

Score: 1.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias occurs when individuals exaggerate the effect a decision will have on their emotions. This can cause people to avoid breaking up, as they overpredict how distressed the choice will make them feel, leading them to remain in the relationship longer.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as exaggerating the effect of decisions on emotions, which aligns with overestimating the impact of future events on future feelings.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that impact bias prevents breakups because people overpredict how distressed breaking up will make them feel, which matches the answer key's point about overestimating how bad a breakup will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting refers to making choices based on how we anticipate an outcome will make us feel. This concept is crucial for end-of-life decisions because individuals often believe they won’t want to continue living when they become severely disabled, elderly, or ill. However, when that moment arrives, people tend to have overestimated their negative feelings and still desire to live. This phenomenon is known as the disability paradox. Therefore, it’s important to keep this in mind when people make end-of-life decisions while they are still healthy.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies affective forecasting as predicting future emotional states, though they phrase it as 'making choices based on how we anticipate an outcome will make us feel' which captures the essence of predicting our own future emotional responses.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that healthy people predict they will prefer to die when sick/disabled, but when actually in that situation they still want to live, demonstrating understanding of the key discrepancy in affective forecasting for end-of-life decisions.

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

People tend to undervalue small probabilities, and there is a distinction between somewhat low and exceptionally low probabilities.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student states people 'undervalue' small probabilities, but according to prospect theory, merely low probabilities (like 10%) are typically overestimated, not undervalued.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that there is a distinction between somewhat low and exceptionally low probabilities, which aligns with the answer key's differentiation between merely low and extremely low probabilities.

Score: 0.5

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion means we perceive losses as more significant than equivalent gains. We tend to avoid losses, even when choosing the alternative would be more logical from a statistical perspective. This behavior indicates that losses carry a negative value for us.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that losses are perceived as more significant than equivalent gains, which captures the core concept that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities in prospect theory's value function.

Score: 1.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

1. Expected value theory does not account for non-financial outcomes, whereas expected utility theory does. 2. Expected utility theory takes risk aversion into account, while expected value theory does not.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory deals only with financial values while expected utility theory can handle non-financial outcomes, which matches the first point in the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately states that expected utility theory considers risk aversion while expected value theory does not, which aligns with the second point about expected utility theory accounting for heuristics and biases (specifically risk aversion).

Score: 1.0

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

1. Expected value theory focuses solely on financial results. 2. Expected utility theory takes into account both financial and non-financial factors, along with attitudes toward risk. 3. Multi-attribute utility theory resembles expected utility theory but uses different weights for options instead of probabilities. 4. Prospect theory is similar to expected utility theory but serves as a descriptive model, incorporating biases and heuristics.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory focuses on financial outcomes, which aligns with the answer key's description of financial outcomes with probabilities.
- Correct: The student accurately describes expected utility theory as incorporating both financial and non-financial factors, which matches the answer key's explanation of subjective utility beyond just financial outcomes.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly describes multi-attribute utility theory as using 'different weights for options instead of probabilities' when it actually involves multiple attributes each with utilities and weights, not a replacement of probabilities.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies prospect theory as a descriptive model that incorporates biases and heuristics, similar to expected utility theory, which matches the answer key.

Score: 0.75

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Yes, when individuals perceive a possibility of loss, they tend to take more risks, whereas when they see an opportunity for gain, they usually prefer to avoid risk.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion leads people to take more risks when facing potential losses, which demonstrates understanding that loss aversion can decrease risk aversion and make people risk-seeking in loss domains.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning is learning that occurs by linking two different things. Classical conditioning involves learning the connection between two events that often occur simultaneously in the same place. Operant conditioning is learning through the use of rewards and punishments.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as learning through linking/associations, which aligns with the answer key's concept of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as learning connections between two events that occur simultaneously in the same place, which matches the answer key's description of associating things that happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning through rewards and punishments, which aligns with the answer key's definition of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

In illusory causation, individuals believe one event causes another when, in reality, only a correlation exists. In illusory correlation, people perceive a connection between two things that does not actually exist.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly distinguishes between illusory causation (mistaking correlation for causation) and illusory correlation (perceiving non-existent correlations). The explanation accurately captures that illusory causation involves incorrectly interpreting an existing correlation as causal, while illusory correlation involves perceiving correlations that don't actually exist.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

A schema offers a framework that assists us in understanding a situation and responding suitably, often based on theoretical structures. For example, being familiar with the Dutch healthcare system represents a schema. A script is a type of social schema related to typical scenarios, such as knowing the expected behavior at a birthday party.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that understanding the Dutch healthcare system is a schema and provides an appropriate explanation that it serves as a framework for understanding situations, which aligns with the answer key's description of schemas as knowledge and relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script and accurately describes it as a type of social schema related to typical scenarios with expected behaviors, which matches the answer key's explanation of scripts as social schemas for specific situations.

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

Behaviorists adopt an intentional stance because they aim to understand the reasoning behind a particular behavior, which is most appropriate for this context.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the intentional stance, which focuses on beliefs, desires, and mental states to predict behavior. Behaviorists actually adopted the physical stance because they rejected mental explanations and focused on observable stimulus-response processes and physical mechanisms of behavior.

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design or functional perspective because it explains why things are the way they are, making it suitable for this context.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance (also mentioning 'functional perspective' which is appropriate) and provides a reasonable explanation that this stance explains 'why things are the way they are' in terms of function, which aligns with the answer key's emphasis on considering psychological processes in terms of their function.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

1. Specific: Event B does not occur every time and is not triggered by many different events. 2. Plausible: It makes sense and is reasonable that event A can lead to event B. 3. Contiguous in space and time: Event B happens immediately after event A, not several minutes later. 4. Consistent: Whenever event A occurs, event B also takes place. 5. Cause and effect: When a ball strikes a vase, the vase falls, making it believable that one event caused the other.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the concept of specificity/distinctness, explaining that B should not be triggered by many different events, which aligns with the idea that B follows A but not other events.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies plausibility and provides an accurate explanation that it should make sense and be reasonable for A to cause B.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies contiguity in time and space, explaining that B should happen immediately after A, which captures the temporal and spatial proximity concept.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies consistency and accurately explains that B should always occur when A occurs.
- Incorrect: The student attempts to describe similarity in cause and effect but provides an example of physical causation rather than explaining the heuristic of superficial resemblance between cause and effect.

Score: 0.8

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Negativity bias means that people are more drawn to negative emotional content, such as morally outraged stories, and this type of content tends to leave a stronger impression on us. Availability bias refers to how we estimate the likelihood of an event based on how easily we can recall examples of it. Because we focus more on morally outraged information and it sticks with us, instances of such outrage come to mind more readily, leading us to believe there are more morally outraged people than there really are.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias as the tendency to be drawn to negative content like morally outraged stories, which aligns with the answer key's description of seeking out or placing more weight on negative information.
- Correct: The student accurately describes availability bias (using 'availability bias' instead of 'availability heuristic') as estimating likelihood based on ease of recall, which matches the answer key's definition of estimating frequency based on how easily examples come to mind.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of how these biases work together - negativity bias makes outraged content more memorable and accessible, which through availability bias leads to overestimating the prevalence of moral outrage, matching the causal relationship described in the answer key.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

The framework theory in biology asserts that a virus can be contagious. This principle is now extended to psychology, where negative traits of a person are not actually contagious, but the idea of magical contagion creates the illusion that these negative qualities can be transmitted through a person's belongings.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that biological contagion concepts (viruses being contagious) are being inappropriately applied to the psychological/social domain, where negative traits cannot actually be transmitted through belongings but people act as if they can be.

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A non-delusional conspiracy theory is an explanation that involves a conspiracy, while a delusional conspiracy theory is an explanation that includes a conspiracy but is considered an unusual and culturally unacceptable way of thinking.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly identifies that delusional conspiracy theories are culturally unacceptable, but fails to mention the crucial criterion of irrationality. The answer key requires both irrationality AND lack of common acceptance to distinguish delusional from non-delusional conspiracy theories.

Your answer:

1. sense of isolation 2. confusion about the world 3. perceiving order in chaos

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions 'sense of isolation' which is not listed among the specific cognitive and personality factors in the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student mentions 'confusion about the world' which is not specifically listed in the answer key, though it could relate to believing in simple explanations for complex events.
- Correct: The student mentions 'perceiving order in chaos' which directly corresponds to 'seeing patterns in randomness' from the answer key.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Context amnesia refers to the inability to remember the circumstances or background information surrounding a particular event or detail.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes 'context amnesia' which is not the correct mechanism. The answer key requires 'source amnesia' - forgetting that an incorrect answer was wrong and mistaking it for correct. Context amnesia relates to forgetting circumstances around events, not the source/accuracy of information.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

simple exposure

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identified the concept of mere exposure (though using slightly different terminology 'simple exposure'), which is the psychological mechanism by which repeated exposure to stimuli increases preference for them.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

People tend to underestimate the chances of negative events occurring to them, but individuals with major depressive disorder have this tendency to a lesser extent and thus make more accurate predictions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people with major depressive disorder are more accurate at predicting negative events because they have less tendency toward optimistic bias (underestimating negative events) compared to non-depressed individuals.

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

The prior has a stronger impact on your perception than the sensory evidence, shaping the posterior.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that prior beliefs have a stronger impact on perception when sensory information is unreliable, which matches the key concept that perception becomes increasingly affected by prior beliefs as sensory reliability decreases.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

1. Pre-conventional: acting correctly to avoid punishment and out of self-interest, such as expecting a favor in return for helping someone. 2. Conventional: valuing others' opinions and behaving well by obeying laws to uphold social order. 3. Post-conventional: understanding that moral principles can sometimes clash with one another.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the pre-conventional level as focusing on avoiding punishment and self-interest/rewards, which matches the answer key's description of obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as valuing others' opinions and obeying laws for social order, which aligns with the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Incorrect: The student's description of post-conventional level as 'understanding that moral principles can clash' is incomplete and doesn't capture the key aspect of focusing on abstract principles and values as the basis for moral reasoning.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

Causal model: Our brain perceives events occurring in a specific sequence across space and time, but it cannot recognize alternative sequences that could have occurred. As a result, we tend to consider events that actually happened as more probable than those that did not.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes how the brain perceives events in sequence but doesn't clearly define a causal model as a coherent narrative of how past events are related. The description focuses more on sequential perception than causal relationships.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that events that actually happened are perceived as more probable/inevitable than they were, which captures the essence of how causal models contribute to hindsight bias.

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

When evaluating the past probability of an event, we cannot ignore the information we have gained (known as the curse of knowledge). As a result, we often perceive events that actually occurred as more likely than those that did not.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly explains that newly learned information cannot be avoided when estimating past likelihood judgments, properly identifies this as the curse of knowledge, and demonstrates understanding of how this leads to hindsight bias by making past events seem more predictable than they actually were.

Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing involves seeking the absolute best choice and is linked to neuroticism, while satisficing means settling for an option that is good enough.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as 'seeking the absolute best choice' which aligns with 'trying to make the best choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as 'settling for an option that is good enough' which matches 'making a good-enough choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly states that maximizing 'is linked to neuroticism,' which satisfies the answer key requirement that high neuroticism is associated with the maximizing decision style.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

I would handle this by applying a conditional incentive, informing students that those who attend fewer than 80% of the lectures will lose 2 points on the exam.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The answer shows minimal engagement with the question. It only addresses attendance through a punitive measure without considering actual engagement with material, scalable assessment methods, or the pedagogical principles discussed in the course. The response lacks depth and doesn't demonstrate serious reflection on how to promote active learning within resource constraints.
