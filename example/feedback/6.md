Grade: 5.5

## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

The social intuitionist model suggests that moral reasoning primarily relies on intuition, supplemented by some rational thought. This indicates the involvement of system 1, which operates quickly and effortlessly based on emotions, along with system 2, which contributes a smaller amount of logical reasoning. Overall, system 1 plays the leading role.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 operates based on emotions and intuition, mentioning it 'operates quickly and effortlessly based on emotions' which aligns with the answer key's requirement that System 1 refers to intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student accurately describes System 2 as involving 'logical reasoning' and 'rational thought,' which directly corresponds to the answer key's specification that System 2 refers to reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student clearly states that 'system 1 plays the leading role' and that moral reasoning 'primarily relies on intuition' with rational thought being supplementary, demonstrating understanding that System 1 is more dominant than System 2.

Score: 1.0

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

The representative heuristic involves categorizing things or people based on certain traits or characteristics, assuming they reflect the whole group, but it frequently overlooks the actual likelihood or base rate of that situation being true.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying mechanism, though with a slight spelling variation ('representative' instead of 'representativeness').
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of how the heuristic works by explaining that it involves categorizing based on traits/characteristics that are assumed to reflect the whole group, which aligns with the concept of resembling stereotypes from a category.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring occurs when the initial information you get about a person or thing influences your overall perception of them. Even when new information emerges, it can be difficult to change that initial viewpoint. The primacy effect is related, as it refers to the impact of your first impression on how you view or interact with someone. For instance, if you listen to a teacher's statement, you tend to accept it as true based on that first impression.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as using initial information as a reference point that influences perception, which aligns with the answer key's definition of taking first information as a starting point.
- Incorrect: The student describes the primacy effect as impact of first impressions rather than the tendency to better remember first information. They conflate it with anchoring instead of addressing memory retention.
- Correct: The student implicitly demonstrates understanding that both concepts involve overreliance on first information by describing how initial information influences perception in both cases, though not explicitly stated.

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency to avoid losses, which can lead to taking risks, while risk aversion means having a strong dislike for taking risks. Alternatively, loss aversion might also mean not wanting to lose your profits, so you avoid risks to protect your gains. Since I'm unsure of the exact context, I'll explain both interpretations.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's explanation of loss aversion is incorrect. They describe it as 'tendency to avoid losses' and connect it to risk-taking behavior, but loss aversion specifically refers to the psychological principle that losses are weighted more heavily than equivalent gains, not simply avoiding losses or protecting profits.
- Incorrect: While the student correctly identifies that risk aversion involves dislike for taking risks, they fail to capture the key concept that risk aversion is about preferring certainty over uncertainty. Their explanation is too simplistic and doesn't address the fundamental preference for certain outcomes over uncertain ones.

Score: 0.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias occurs when you predict that an event will affect you more strongly than it actually does.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies impact bias as overestimating how strongly an event will affect you, which matches the answer key's definition of overestimating the impact of future events on future feelings.
- Incorrect: The student does not address the second part of the question about how impact bias could prevent people from breaking up when unhappy in relationships.

Score: 0.5

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting refers to the tendency to exaggerate how you will feel in the future based on your current emotions. This concept is important to keep in mind because, for example, you might be comfortable with the idea of euthanasia now, but if you were to end up in a wheelchair and unable to communicate, your feelings about it might change.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly defines affective forecasting as 'the tendency to exaggerate how you will feel in the future based on your current emotions' rather than simply 'predictions about our own future emotional state.' The definition focuses on exaggeration rather than the broader concept of predicting future emotions.
- Correct: The student correctly captures the key insight that healthy people may have different preferences about end-of-life decisions when actually facing illness compared to their predictions when healthy, using the specific example of euthanasia and disability.

Score: 0.5

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

They tend to undervalue very small probabilities but give disproportionately high importance to probabilities that are somewhat low. For example, 0.01 might be overlooked, whereas 10% would be given too much weight.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that merely low probabilities (like 10%) are overestimated, stating they 'would be given too much weight' which aligns with the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly recognizes that extremely low probabilities (like 0.01%) are undervalued or 'overlooked', which corresponds to the answer key point about treating them as impossibilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

disutility

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The answer 'disutility' is too vague and incomplete. While disutility relates to negative outcomes, it doesn't capture the key concept that loss aversion means negative utilities are weighted more heavily than positive utilities of equivalent magnitude, or that the value function is steeper for losses than gains.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory considers the value as it is without applying any weight, whereas expected utility theory takes the value into account but also adjusts it based on utility.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions value vs utility but doesn't clearly distinguish that expected value theory deals with financial values while expected utility theory deals with both financial and non-financial values.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected utility theory adjusts values (through utility functions), which captures the essence of considering risk aversion, while expected value theory applies no such adjustment.

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected value theory involves considering the actual value of something without applying any additional weighting. Expected utility theory considers the value of something but assigns it a weighted utility, which can be either positive or negative. Multi-attribute utility theory evaluates multiple attributes by assigning values and weights (utilities) to each. Prospect theory focuses on losses and gains, emphasizing that losses have a greater impact than gains.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as dealing with actual values without additional weighting, which aligns with the normative model focusing on financial outcomes and probabilities.
- Correct: The student correctly explains expected utility theory as considering weighted utility values that can be positive or negative, capturing the essence of subjective utility beyond just financial outcomes.
- Correct: The student accurately describes multi-attribute utility theory as evaluating multiple attributes with assigned values and weights, correctly identifying the key components of this normative model.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies prospect theory's focus on losses and gains with loss aversion (losses having greater impact than gains), which captures the behavioral/descriptive nature and key bias of this model.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the reluctance to incur losses, which can lead to taking more risks, whereas risk aversion is a dislike of taking risks. To avoid losses, one might take risks, which can reduce risk aversion. Alternatively, if loss aversion means not wanting to lose existing gains, it can result in risk aversion to protect those gains. In this scenario, loss aversion strongly influences risk aversion, as both involve avoiding risk.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student shows confusion about the relationship between loss aversion and risk aversion. While they correctly identify that loss aversion can lead to risk-taking to avoid losses, they also incorrectly suggest that loss aversion can increase risk aversion to protect gains, and conclude that both involve avoiding risk. The answer key specifically states that loss aversion decreases risk aversion and can make people risk-seeking, but the student's answer is contradictory and doesn't clearly establish this key relationship.

Score: 0.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Learning through covariation involves understanding that two events are linked. Classical conditioning occurs when you learn that event A predicts event B, so they become connected. Operant conditioning involves learning that a behavior leads to a consequence, either a reward or a punishment.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that conditioning involves learning through covariation and understanding that events are linked, which matches the key concept of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as learning that one event predicts another and they become connected, which aligns with the answer key's description of learning associations when things happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning that behavior leads to consequences (rewards or punishments), which directly matches the answer key's definition of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation occurs when a real correlation is mistaken for a cause-and-effect relationship, while illusory correlation involves perceiving a connection between two unrelated random events.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly distinguishes between the two concepts: illusory causation as misinterpreting an actual correlation as causation, and illusory correlation as perceiving a relationship where none exists. The phrase 'unrelated random events' effectively captures that no actual correlation is present in illusory correlation.

Score: 1.0

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

A script outlines the appropriate behavior in a specific situation, while a schema provides a wider framework for understanding a concept within our world. How to act correctly is an example of a script, and the functioning of the Dutch healthcare system is an example of a schema.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that understanding the Dutch healthcare system is a schema and provides an appropriate explanation that it represents a wider framework for understanding a concept, which aligns with the answer key's description of knowledge and relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script and provides an accurate explanation that scripts outline appropriate behavior in specific situations, which matches the answer key's description of social schemas describing situational behavior.

Score: 1.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

It is physical since it seeks to explain only what is observable. Intentionality cannot be measured because the mind itself is not measurable.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the physical stance and provides valid reasoning. They understand that behaviorists focused on observable phenomena (stimuli and behaviors) rather than unobservable mental states, which aligns with the physical stance's emphasis on measurable, physical processes.

Score: 1.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

Design focuses on the purpose something serves, but it can also be deliberate since protection is an action carried out with intention.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly identifies the design stance and mentions purpose/function, but then incorrectly introduces the concept of deliberate intention. Evolutionary psychology adopts the design stance because it examines psychological processes in terms of their adaptive function, not because of deliberate intention. Evolution operates without conscious design or intention.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Clear and definite: the event must be specific. Reliable: it should occur every time. Believable: it has to be reasonable to happen. Occurring close together in time and location: one event must follow the other, happening simultaneously and in the same place. Having a similar cause and effect: the actions involved need to be related in a comparable way (like kicking a ball, where the leg's movement causes the ball to move).

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies specificity/distinctness with 'Clear and definite: the event must be specific' which captures the essence that B should follow A but not other events.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies consistency with 'Reliable: it should occur every time' which matches the requirement that B always follows A.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies plausibility with 'Believable: it has to be reasonable to happen' which aligns with the common sense requirement for causation.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies contiguity in time and space with 'Occurring close together in time and location... happening simultaneously and in the same place' which matches the temporal and spatial proximity requirement.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies similarity in cause and effect with 'Having a similar cause and effect: the actions involved need to be related in a comparable way' and provides a good example with the ball kicking scenario.

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Negativity bias, confirmation bias, and the representativeness heuristic all play a role. We tend to focus more on negative aspects, and with the representativeness heuristic, we might mistakenly believe that the group of people reflects the entire population, which is unlikely. Confirmation bias also occurs because we seek out information that supports our own views, reinforcing the idea that others share our opinions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias and explains it as focusing more on negative aspects, which aligns with the answer key's description of seeking out or placing more weight on negative information like morally outraged content.
- Incorrect: The student identifies the representativeness heuristic instead of the availability heuristic. While both are cognitive biases, the availability heuristic specifically relates to estimating frequency based on ease of recall, which is the key mechanism for overestimating moral outrage on social media.
- Incorrect: The student does not explain how the two biases work together to cause overestimation of moral outrage. They mention confirmation bias (which is not in the answer key) but fail to connect negativity bias with the availability heuristic to show the causal mechanism.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

domain mismatch error

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies this as a domain mismatch error, which captures the essence of applying biological contagion concepts incorrectly to social/psychological domains.

Score: 1.0

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

The merits and the chances of it occurring. While the probability of a plane crash is low, a reporter dying in such an accident after criticizing Putin is far more plausibly a conspiracy than a Democratic politician running a sex ring at a fast-food place known as pizzagate.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student discusses plausibility and probability of conspiracy theories but does not address the key distinction that delusional conspiracy theories are characterized by being both irrational beliefs AND not commonly accepted, while non-delusional ones lack one or both of these characteristics.

Score: 0.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

Schizophrenic traits, limited financial resources, low educational attainment, belonging to an ethnic minority, distrust in government, feelings of moral indignation, and a mindset of division between "us" and "them." Infringement on the ability to make personal decisions and breach of individual values.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions 'schizophrenic traits' which is not listed in the answer key. The answer key focuses on cognitive biases like seeing patterns in randomness, believing paranormal phenomena, and attributing agency incorrectly.
- Incorrect: The student mentions 'limited financial resources' and 'low educational attainment' but the answer key specifically refers to 'low level of intelligence' and 'low level of analytical thinking' as cognitive factors, not socioeconomic status.
- Incorrect: The student mentions social and political factors like 'distrust in government' and 'us vs them mindset' but the answer key focuses on cognitive and personality factors such as narcissism, believing in simple explanations for complex events, and gender differences.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Correcting false information or addressing bias from a source can be challenging because when you encounter a statement—whether accurate or not—you may forget its truthfulness within about 30 minutes. As a result, you begin to blend facts with falsehoods since your mind is affected by all the information you receive, regardless of its accuracy.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the core mechanism of source amnesia - forgetting the truthfulness/source of information and then potentially confusing incorrect information as correct. While they describe it in terms of forgetting truthfulness rather than source specifically, and mention a 30-minute timeframe, the fundamental psychological process they describe aligns with how source amnesia can cause incorrect quiz answers to interfere with learning.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

availability heuristic refers to the mental shortcut where people judge the likelihood of an event based on how easily examples come to mind.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student only defined the availability heuristic, which was already mentioned in the question. They did not address the actual question asking for the psychological mechanism politicians use when repeating messages (mere exposure effect or illusory-truth effect).

Score: 0.0

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

yes, because they tend to focus more on negative information.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly answered 'yes' when the correct answer is 'no' - people with major depressive disorder are more accurate, not less accurate. Additionally, the explanation about focusing on negative information doesn't capture the key concept of reduced optimism bias that makes depressed individuals more realistic in their predictions.

Score: 0.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

Your perception closely aligns with your initial belief.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The answer is too vague and doesn't specifically address what happens when sensory information reliability decreases. It mentions alignment with initial belief but fails to explain the key relationship that prior beliefs have MORE influence when sensory reliability is low.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

Preconventional stage: behavior is largely driven by rewards, punishments, and reciprocal actions (like "you help me, I help you"). Conventional stage: actions are taken to be viewed positively by others and to make others feel happy. Postconventional stage: individuals may experience conflicts between different moral principles.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the preconventional level as being driven by rewards and punishments, which aligns with the answer key's focus on avoiding punishment or gaining rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as actions taken to be viewed positively by others and make others happy, which matches the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Incorrect: The student's description of the postconventional level as experiencing conflicts between moral principles is incomplete and doesn't capture the key aspect of focusing on abstract principles and values as stated in the answer key.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

When you begin investigating the cause of an event and receive that information, hindsight bias arises because the new details make you believe you had predicted it from the start.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student does not define what a causal model is. They mention investigating causes but fail to explain that a causal model is a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Incorrect: The student misunderstands how causal models contribute to hindsight bias. They suggest it makes you think you predicted the event, but the key point is that events in a causal model seem more inevitable than they actually were.

Score: 0.0

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

You cannot erase newly acquired information, so it affects your mind and makes you believe you always knew it.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that newly acquired information cannot be ignored and affects judgments about past knowledge, which is the core mechanism of how learning contributes to hindsight bias.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing involves striving to always select the best possible option, while satisficing means being content with a choice that is good enough. Maximizing is associated with neuroticism.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as striving to select the best possible option, which aligns with the answer key's definition of 'trying to make the best choice.'
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as being content with a choice that is good enough, which matches the answer key's definition of 'making a good-enough choice.'
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that maximizing is associated with neuroticism, which corresponds to the answer key's statement that those high in neuroticism are most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style.

Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.
