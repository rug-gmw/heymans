## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidtâ€™s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

System 1 thinking is based on moral intuition, while System 2 involves moral reasoning. Therefore, moral reasoning relies on System 2. According to the model, people primarily use intuition to form moral judgments, making System 1 the most influential.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 thinking is based on moral intuition, which aligns with the answer key's requirement about System 1 referring to intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student accurately states that System 2 involves moral reasoning, which matches the answer key's requirement about System 2 referring to reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student clearly states that System 1 is 'the most influential' and that people 'primarily use intuition,' which correctly identifies System 1 as more dominant than System 2.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

The representative heuristic suggests that you determine whether something fits into a particular category by how closely it matches the typical features of that category.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying concept, though with a minor spelling variation ('representative' instead of 'representativeness').
- Correct: The student accurately explains the heuristic by describing how likelihood of category membership is determined by similarity to typical features/characteristics of that category, which matches the key concept of resembling stereotypes.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring refers to the tendency for the initial information you receive to act as a reference point, while the primacy effect means that subsequent information usually isn't enough to alter that initial impression, making the first information the most influential in shaping your overall perception.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as the tendency for initial information to act as a reference point, which captures the essence of taking the first piece of information as the starting point.
- Incorrect: The student describes the primacy effect as subsequent information not being enough to alter initial impressions, but fails to identify it as the tendency to better remember the first piece of information.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both concepts involve overreliance on first information, stating that initial information is 'most influential in shaping overall perception.'

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Risk aversion involves preferring certainty over uncertainty, while loss aversion means avoiding the possibility of a loss, even when the potential gain is equally likely.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes loss aversion as 'avoiding the possibility of a loss, even when the potential gain is equally likely' which misses the key concept that losses are weighted more heavily than equivalent gains. This describes risk-averse behavior rather than the asymmetric weighting principle of loss aversion.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies risk aversion as 'preferring certainty over uncertainty,' which accurately captures the key concept from the answer key.

Score: 0.5

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias occurs when individuals overestimate how strongly a decision will influence their emotions. This bias can stop people from ending relationships because they believe the emotional pain of breaking up will be greater than staying together.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as overestimating how strongly future events (decisions) will influence emotions, which matches the answer key's definition of overestimating the impact of future events on future feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly explains that impact bias prevents breakups because people overestimate the emotional pain/negative feelings that would result from breaking up, which aligns with the answer key's point about overestimating how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves anticipating how your choices will influence your future emotions. This concept is crucial in end-of-life decisions because individuals may initially believe they wouldn't want to live in a particular condition, yet once experiencing it, their actual feelings may be less intense than expected, leading them to prefer continuing life.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies affective forecasting as predictions about future emotional states, though they phrase it as 'anticipating how choices will influence future emotions' which captures the same concept.
- Correct: The student accurately explains the key application to end-of-life decisions - that healthy people may predict they'll want to die when sick, but when actually experiencing illness, they may prefer to continue living.

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

People tend to undervalue low probabilities, treating both low and extremely low probabilities similarly.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that people undervalue low probabilities, when prospect theory shows that merely low probabilities (like 10%) are typically overestimated.
- Incorrect: The student claims that low and extremely low probabilities are treated similarly, missing the key distinction that extremely low probabilities are often treated as impossibilities while merely low probabilities are overestimated.

Score: 0.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion represents a negative value or dissatisfaction.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The answer is too vague and doesn't capture the key concept that loss aversion means negative utilities are weighted more heavily than positive utilities, or that the value function is steeper for losses than gains.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory considers values and probabilities, while expected utility theory considers utilities and probabilities. Additionally, expected utility theory incorporates risk aversion, which expected value theory does not.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory deals with values while expected utility theory deals with utilities, which captures the essence of financial vs non-financial considerations since utilities can represent subjective valuations beyond monetary terms.
- Correct: The student correctly states that expected utility theory incorporates risk aversion while expected value theory does not, which aligns with the answer key's point about expected utility considering risk aversion whereas expected value theory does not consider heuristics and biases.

Score: 1.0

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesnâ€™t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected value theory is a normative decision model that considers both value and probability. Expected utility theory, also a normative model, incorporates utility and probability into decision-making. Multi-attribute utility theory, another normative model, accounts for different utilities for each attribute along with probability. Prospect theory is a descriptive decision model that builds on expected utility theory by including heuristics and biases.

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies expected value theory as a normative model involving value and probability, capturing the core concept.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies expected utility theory as a normative model incorporating utility and probability, demonstrating understanding of the key difference from expected value theory.
- Incorrect: Student incorrectly mentions probability in multi-attribute utility theory when the key concept is multiple attributes with utilities and weights, not probability.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies prospect theory as a descriptive model that builds on expected utility theory by including heuristics and biases.

Score: 0.75

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease peopleâ€™s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Loss aversion means that individuals place greater emphasis on losses than on gains when evaluating risks. As a result, this tendency makes people more cautious and reluctant to take risks.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly defines loss aversion but incorrectly concludes it makes people more risk averse. The answer key shows that loss aversion actually decreases risk aversion and can make people risk-seeking when trying to avoid losses, which is the opposite of what the student stated.

Score: 0.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves learning connections through correlation. Classical conditioning is the process of associating two events that occur together in time and place, while operant conditioning involves learning the link between a behavior and its consequences, such as a reward or punishment.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as learning connections/associations through correlation/covariation, which matches the key concept.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as associating two events that occur together in time and place, which aligns with the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning the link between behavior and consequences (rewards/punishments), which matches the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory correlation refers to perceiving a relationship between two variables when none actually exists, while illusory causation involves interpreting a causal link between correlated variables even though no cause-and-effect relationship is present.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly distinguishes between illusory correlation (perceiving correlation where none exists) and illusory causation (incorrectly interpreting correlation as causation). The answer accurately captures both concepts and their key difference.

Score: 1.0

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to â€˜properlyâ€™ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

Knowing how the healthcare system operates is a schema, as it links ideas to make sense of a social context. Meanwhile, knowing how to act at a party is a script, which is a culturally specific social schema applied in a particular social setting.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies healthcare system knowledge as a schema and provides a reasonable explanation that it involves linking ideas to make sense of context, which aligns with schemas being about knowledge and relationships.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies birthday party behavior as a script and accurately describes it as a culturally specific social schema for a particular setting, which matches the answer key's emphasis on situational behavior.

Score: 1.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

The behaviorists took a physical perspective, focusing solely on individuals' actions and the reasons behind those behaviors, without considering their intentions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that behaviorists adopted the physical stance and accurately explains that they focused on observable behaviors and their causes (stimulus-response relationships) rather than mental states or intentions, which aligns with the answer key's emphasis on processes that cause stimuli to result in behavior.

Score: 1.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

They take a practical viewpoint, focusing on usefulness rather than considering emotions.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions 'practical viewpoint' and 'usefulness' which shows some understanding of the functional aspect, but fails to identify the specific 'design stance' from Dennett's levels of analysis that the question asks for. The answer is too vague and doesn't demonstrate knowledge of Dennett's framework.

Score: 0.0

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Specific means B occurs exclusively when A takes place; consistent means B always happens if and only if A occurs; plausible suggests B does not occur without A; contiguous in time and space indicates A and B happen simultaneously in the same location; and similar in cause and effect implies that A leads to B.

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies specificity/distinctness - that B occurs exclusively when A takes place matches the concept that B follows A but not other events.
- Incorrect: Student describes consistency as 'if and only if' which is too strong - the answer key only requires that B always follows A, not that A is the only cause of B.
- Incorrect: Student describes plausibility as 'B does not occur without A' which is about necessity, not about common sense making the causal relationship believable.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies contiguity in time and space as A and B happening simultaneously in the same location.
- Incorrect: Student's description 'A leads to B' is too vague and doesn't capture the key concept of superficial resemblance between cause and effect.

Score: 0.4

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Due to negative bias, individuals are drawn to negative emotional content. The availability heuristic causes us to judge how likely something is based on how easily we can recall examples of it. Therefore, when we encounter morally outraged posts on social media, we are inclined to seek them out and receive more through the algorithm. As a result, we perceive these events as more common than they actually are because we have many examples at hand, leading us to overestimate their frequency.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias and explains it as being drawn to negative emotional content, which aligns with the answer key's description of seeking out or placing more weight on negative information like morally outraged content.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the availability heuristic as judging likelihood based on how easily we can recall examples, which matches the answer key's definition of estimating frequency based on ease of recall.
- Correct: The student successfully connects both biases to explain the overestimation phenomenon - negativity bias draws us to outraged content, creating more examples in memory, which through availability heuristic leads to overestimating frequency. This demonstrates the causal relationship described in the answer key.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

Loss framing serves as a theoretical framework where people avoid risks to prevent losing everything, while gain framing involves avoiding certain actions because individuals believe they can benefit more by refraining.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student discusses loss and gain framing, which is unrelated to the question about magical contagion and framework theories. The answer key expects an explanation of how biological contagion concepts are misapplied to social/psychological domains, but the student's response does not address contagion, domain transfer, or framework theories at all.

Score: 0.0

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A delusional conspiracy theory is held by a small number of individuals and is not grounded in the principles of physics or religion. In contrast, a non-delusional conspiracy theory may be accepted by many people and can potentially be accurate.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the distinguishing factors. They mention 'grounded in principles of physics or religion' and 'small number of individuals' rather than the key criteria of being both an irrational belief AND not commonly accepted. The student does partially capture the 'commonly accepted' aspect but misses the critical 'irrational belief' component that defines delusional conspiracy theories.

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

Your answer:

Egotistical, male, lacking intelligence

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies narcissism/being egotistical as a personality factor contributing to conspiratorial thinking.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies being male as a demographic factor associated with conspiratorial thinking.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies low intelligence as a cognitive factor contributing to conspiratorial thinking.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you donâ€™t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

source amnesia occurs when a person remembers information but cannot recall where or how they learned it.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies source amnesia as the key mechanism. While they provide a general definition rather than explaining the specific application to the quiz scenario, they demonstrate understanding of the core concept that source amnesia involves forgetting the source of information, which is the psychological mechanism through which incorrect answers can interfere with learning.

Score: 1.0

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

mental ease

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The answer 'mental ease' does not identify the specific psychological mechanism of mere exposure effect or illusory-truth effect. While repetition may create mental ease, this is too vague and doesn't capture the key concept that familiarity breeds preference.

Score: 0.0

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

No, it actually improves their accuracy. In depressive disorder, the thought patterns may be more aligned with a normative model.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that major depressive disorder improves accuracy in predictions about negative events, which aligns with the key point that depressed individuals are more accurate due to reduced optimistic bias. The reference to 'normative model' appropriately captures the concept that their predictions are more realistic/accurate.

Score: 1.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

The formation of perception is increasingly influenced by prior beliefs.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that prior beliefs have increased influence on perception when sensory information reliability decreases, which directly matches the key concept from the answer key.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You donâ€™t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other peopleâ€™s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

The pre-conventional level is where an individual focuses solely on their own emotions and personal gains or losses. At the conventional level, a person takes into account the feelings of others as well. The postconventional level involves considering broader principles and global perspectives.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions 'personal gains or losses' which partially aligns with gaining rewards, but focuses on 'emotions' rather than the key concepts of avoiding punishment and gaining rewards through rule obedience.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that the conventional level involves 'taking into account the feelings of others,' which matches the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly describes the post-conventional level as involving 'broader principles and global perspectives,' which aligns with the answer key's focus on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model suggests that it is simpler to think about events that actually occurred than to consider alternative possibilities, due to the ease of cognitive processing. This means you can more readily assess what did happen compared to what might have happened.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student does not define a causal model as a coherent narrative of how past events are related. Instead, they focus on cognitive processing ease without explaining what a causal model actually is.
- Incorrect: The student does not explain how causal models contribute to hindsight bias by making events seem more inevitable. They mention cognitive ease but fail to connect this to the inevitability aspect that drives hindsight bias.

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

When forming an opinion about the past, people cannot disregard information they have learned more recently.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people cannot avoid incorporating newly learned information when making judgments about the past, which is the core mechanism of how learning contributes to hindsight bias.

Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing involves striving to select the best possible option, while satisficing means choosing an option that is adequate. Neuroticism is associated with a maximizing decision-making approach.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as striving to select the best possible option, which aligns with the answer key's description of trying to make the best choice.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as choosing an option that is adequate, which matches the answer key's description of making a good-enough choice.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that neuroticism is associated with a maximizing decision-making approach, which matches the answer key's statement about high neuroticism leading to adopting the maximizing decision style.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

I would employ a nudge to encourage students to join the course voluntarily. I might use conditioning by linking participation to passing, repeatedly emphasizing in lectures and assignments that actively engaging increases the chances of successfully completing the course.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement by proposing specific behavioral interventions (nudging and conditioning) and connecting participation to course success. While the approach focuses on motivation rather than assessment methods, it shows thoughtful consideration of how to encourage active engagement within resource constraints.
