## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

System 1 thinking is quick and intuitive, often depending on mental shortcuts. It is used in moral judgments that don't require thorough reflection. In contrast, System 2 thinking is deliberate, slow, and analytical, allowing for a more thoughtful and critical approach to moral reasoning.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies System 1 as intuitive thinking, which aligns with the answer key's requirement to identify System 1 as intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student correctly describes System 2 as deliberate, analytical thinking, which matches the answer key's requirement to identify System 2 as reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Incorrect: The student does not address which system is more dominant according to Haidt's social-intuitionist model. They describe both systems but fail to state that System 1 (intuition/emotion) is more dominant than System 2.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

Representative heuristic: because this coworker resembles a fashion model, it’s a simple mental shortcut to assume that she is one.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process, though they spell it as 'representative' instead of 'representativeness'.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of the heuristic by explaining that resembling a fashion model leads to the assumption of being one, which captures the essence of judging category membership based on similarity to stereotypes.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring refers to how the initial impression sets a reference point that limits how much your judgment can shift from it. The primacy effect explains that information presented first has a significantly stronger influence on the overall impression. Both concepts share the idea that early information strongly impacts subsequent perceptions, whether in forming impressions (primacy effect) or during negotiations (anchoring).

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as using initial information as a reference point that influences subsequent judgments, which aligns with the answer key's definition of taking the first piece of information as the starting point.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as first-presented information having stronger influence on overall impressions, which corresponds to the answer key's point about better remembering first information.
- Correct: The student clearly identifies that both concepts involve early/first information strongly impacting subsequent perceptions, which matches the answer key's point about overreliance on first information.

Score: 1.0

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion involves trying to avoid experiencing any losses, while risk aversion is about steering clear of taking risks.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes loss aversion as 'trying to avoid experiencing any losses' which misses the key concept that losses are weighted more heavily than equivalent gains. The answer doesn't capture the asymmetric weighting between losses and gains.
- Incorrect: The student describes risk aversion as 'steering clear of taking risks' which is too simplistic and doesn't capture the preference for certainty over uncertainty. Risk aversion is about preferring certain outcomes over uncertain ones with the same expected value, not just avoiding all risks.

Score: 0.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias refers to the tendency to overestimate the extent of the consequences an action will have. This can lead to a state of inaction, where a person remains in the current situation because they fear that the negative outcomes of making a change, such as ending a relationship, will be more painful than simply staying unhappy.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes impact bias as overestimating consequences of actions generally, but the answer key specifically defines it as overestimating the impact of future events on our future feelings. The student's definition is too broad and misses the key aspect about emotional impact.
- Correct: The student correctly explains that impact bias can prevent breakups by making people fear that ending the relationship will be more painful than staying unhappy, which aligns with the answer key's point about overestimating how bad a breakup will make them feel.

Score: 0.5

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting refers to the tendency to believe we can accurately predict our future emotions. This concept is significant in end-of-life choices because these decisions are critical, and having a realistic understanding of how one will feel is essential.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies affective forecasting as predictions about future emotions, which aligns with the answer key's definition of 'predictions about our own future emotional state.'
- Incorrect: While the student mentions the importance of affective forecasting in end-of-life decisions, they don't explain the specific phenomenon described in the answer key - that healthy people may predict preferring death when sick, but actually sick people may not prefer to die.

Score: 0.5

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

People are typically poor at understanding probabilities and often overestimate low chances. The gap between 10% and 0.01% isn't perceived as significant, even though 0.01% is far less likely to occur.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people overestimate low probabilities, which aligns with the answer key's point about merely low probabilities being overestimated.
- Incorrect: The student states that people don't perceive a significant difference between 10% and 0.01%, but fails to mention that extremely low probabilities are often treated as impossibilities, which is the key distinction in prospect theory.

Score: 0.5

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

The anxiety of parting with something you currently possess.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The answer describes an emotional or psychological feeling rather than the technical utility function property. Loss aversion in prospect theory specifically refers to the mathematical relationship where the value function is steeper for losses than gains, meaning negative utilities are weighted more heavily than positive utilities of equal magnitude.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory applies only to financial outcomes, whereas expected utility theory encompasses both financial and non-financial factors (utilities). Additionally, expected value theory can be used to assess choices within expected utility theory, but the reverse is not true.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory deals only with financial outcomes while expected utility theory encompasses both financial and non-financial factors (utilities), which matches the first point in the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student's second point about expected value theory being used to assess choices within expected utility theory does not address the key difference regarding risk aversion and heuristics/biases as specified in the answer key.

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

preferred model, expected utility model, expected value model, model combining expected value and utility

Feedback:

- Incorrect: Student mentions 'expected value model' which corresponds to expected value theory, but provides no explanation of what it is or how it works.
- Incorrect: Student mentions 'expected utility model' which corresponds to expected utility theory, but provides no explanation of the concept or how it differs from expected value.
- Incorrect: Student does not mention multi-attribute utility theory at all. None of the listed models correspond to this concept.
- Incorrect: Student does not mention prospect theory. The 'preferred model' and 'model combining expected value and utility' do not correspond to prospect theory's descriptive/behavioral approach.

Score: 0.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

The possibility of losing motivates people to take greater risks. This means that individuals tend to take more chances when they are aiming to avoid losses.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion leads people to take greater risks when trying to avoid losses, which aligns with the key point that loss aversion can decrease risk aversion and make people risk-seeking in loss domains.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning refers to the process of forming learned connections. Classical conditioning occurs when an external source influences behavior, such as Pavlov’s dogs, whereas operant conditioning involves the internal reward system, where actions that produce positive feelings are reinforced as good, and actions that cause discomfort are seen as bad.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as forming learned connections, which aligns with learning associations through covariation from the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student describes classical conditioning as 'external source influences behavior' rather than the key concept of learning associations when two things happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly captures that operant conditioning involves actions leading to positive or negative consequences (rewards/punishments), though they phrase it in terms of internal feelings rather than external rewards/punishments.

Score: 0.6666666666666666

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation occurs when we think one thing causes another, even though it may not. Illusory correlation happens when we assume there is a relationship between two variables, despite there possibly being none.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that illusory causation involves incorrectly assuming a causal relationship and illusory correlation involves perceiving a relationship (correlation) that doesn't actually exist. While the wording is slightly different from the answer key, the core concepts are accurately captured.

Score: 1.0

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

- A birthday party schema outlines the emotions, anticipations, and typical actions involved in such an event.  
- Understanding the Dutch healthcare system is a script, as it is based on factual information.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the healthcare system as a script and birthday party as a schema, which is the reverse of the correct answer. Healthcare system knowledge is a schema (organized knowledge structure), not a script.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies birthday party behavior as a schema rather than a script. Birthday party behavior is a script because it involves sequential actions and behavioral expectations in a specific social situation, not just organized knowledge.

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

The initial position

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's answer 'The initial position' does not address the question at all. It fails to identify which of Dennett's stances behaviorists adopted (physical stance) and provides no explanation for why they adopted this stance.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

The initial position

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student answer 'The initial position' does not address the question at all. It fails to identify that evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, and provides no explanation about considering psychological processes in terms of their function.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Availability heuristic, representative heuristic, formation of a cause-and-effect connection

Feedback:

- Incorrect: Student mentions 'availability heuristic' which is not one of the five heuristics for judging causation. The correct answer is distinctness/specificity.
- Incorrect: Student mentions 'representative heuristic' which is not one of the five heuristics for judging causation. The correct answer is consistency.
- Incorrect: Student mentions 'formation of a cause-and-effect connection' which is vague and not one of the five specific heuristics. The correct answer is plausibility.
- Incorrect: Student did not mention contiguity in time and space, which is one of the five required heuristics for judging causation.
- Incorrect: Student did not mention similarity in cause and effect, which is one of the five required heuristics for judging causation.

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Availability heuristics make it seem like these comments are widespread because we frequently encounter them on social media.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student does not mention the negativity bias, which is one of the two primary biases asked for in the question.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the availability heuristic and explains how frequent encounters on social media lead to overestimation of prevalence.
- Incorrect: The student does not explain the interaction between negativity bias and availability heuristic - how negativity bias increases exposure to outraged content, which then feeds into the availability heuristic.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

Here's an example: I'm in third grade, and a boy in my class whom I don't like hands me his pen. Even though I like the pen itself, the entire situation makes me dislike it, so I probably won't use it since it belonged to someone I don't like.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that magical contagion involves applying biological concepts (like contamination/infection) to social situations where they don't logically apply. The example demonstrates how the dislike for a person is irrationally transferred to an object they owned, showing the inappropriate application of contagion principles from the biological domain to the social domain.

Score: 1.0

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A conspiracy theory that is not delusional is comprehensible and has a straightforward cause-and-effect explanation, whereas a delusional conspiracy depends on mental shortcuts and cognitive biases.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student focuses on comprehensibility and cognitive biases rather than the key criteria from the answer key: irrationality of belief and social acceptance. The answer key defines delusional conspiracy theories as those that are both irrational beliefs AND not commonly accepted, which the student does not address.

Score: 0.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

Personality traits such as neuroticism and openness play a significant role, along with the use of heuristics and lower intelligence.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions 'neuroticism and openness' but these specific personality traits are not listed in the answer key. The answer key includes narcissism as a personality factor, but not neuroticism or openness.
- Correct: The student mentions 'lower intelligence' which directly corresponds to 'having a low level of intelligence' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student mentions 'use of heuristics' which relates to 'having a low level of analytical thinking' from the answer key, as heuristics represent simplified mental shortcuts rather than deep analytical processing.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

During the exam, you may recall the moment when you previously tackled the same question while studying. However, if you initially got it wrong, that incorrect answer might resurface in your memory.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes the general phenomenon of recalling incorrect answers but does not identify the specific psychological mechanism. The answer lacks mention of source amnesia, proactive interference, or the continued-influence effect that explains why incorrect answers interfere with learning.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

Mere exposure effect: the more frequently someone encounters something, the more familiar and acceptable it becomes. Similarly, people tend to feel more attracted to someone they see regularly.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the mere exposure effect and provides an accurate description of how increased frequency of exposure leads to greater familiarity and acceptance, which directly answers the question about how politicians use repetition to make their message more attractive.

Score: 1.0

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Yes, they become less accurate because they produce more incorrect predictions about the future than neurotypical individuals, but only a limited number of these predictions actually happen. As a result, their accuracy is reduced.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that people with major depressive disorder are less accurate at predictions, when the answer key indicates they are actually more accurate due to reduced optimism bias. The student's reasoning about incorrect predictions is contrary to established research showing depressed individuals have more realistic (accurate) threat assessments.

Score: 0.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

When external sensory input is reduced, we tend to depend more on information we have previously inferred from our environment, as well as on existing beliefs or stereotypes.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when sensory input is reduced/less reliable, there is increased dependence on prior information and existing beliefs, which directly addresses how prior beliefs have greater influence when sensory reliability decreases.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

descriptive, operant, and operational

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student listed 'descriptive' which does not correspond to Kohlberg's pre-conventional level focused on avoiding punishment and gaining rewards.
- Incorrect: The student listed 'operant' which does not correspond to Kohlberg's conventional level focused on social norms and others' feelings.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model is a phenomenon used to provide causal explanations for past events. This allows us to interpret past occurrences, even if our explanations turn out to be incorrect.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a causal model provides explanations for past events, which aligns with the key concept of creating a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Incorrect: The student does not explain how causal models contribute to hindsight bias - specifically missing that events in causal models seem more inevitable than they actually were.

Score: 0.5

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Hindsight bias refers to the sensation of feeling like you knew something all along. After discovering new information, you might recognize that you could have understood it from the beginning.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student provides a general definition of hindsight bias but fails to address the specific question about how learning contributes to it. The answer does not mention that newly learned information cannot be avoided when estimating past likelihood judgments, which is the key mechanism by which learning creates hindsight bias.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximising refers to attempting to choose the best possible option in a given situation. Satisficing involves selecting an option that is "good enough" rather than perfect. Individuals with high levels of neuroticism are more likely to adopt a maximising decision-making approach.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as attempting to choose the best possible option, which aligns with the answer key's definition of 'trying to make the best choice'.
- Correct: The student accurately defines satisficing as selecting an option that is 'good enough' rather than perfect, which matches the answer key's definition of 'making a good-enough choice'.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that individuals with high neuroticism are more likely to adopt a maximizing decision-making approach, which directly corresponds to the answer key.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

Several methods can be applied in this context. The way tasks, lectures, and similar activities are organized and presented plays a crucial role. Are they arranged in an engaging manner? Additionally, it’s possible to gently guide individuals toward the desired behavior. For instance, requiring some brief assignments—perhaps assessed on a pass/fail basis by peers to conserve resources—can ensure participants interact with the content and reflect on it, which may increase their interest in the course.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement with the question by providing concrete, practical solutions that address the core challenge of promoting active engagement while managing limited resources. They suggest specific strategies like organizing content in engaging ways, using peer assessment on a pass/fail basis, and implementing brief assignments that encourage interaction and reflection. The answer shows understanding of both the pedagogical goals and resource constraints mentioned in the question.
