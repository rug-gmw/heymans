## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidtâ€™s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

System 1 provides intuitions that are partly inborn and influenced by emotions, whereas System 2 involves the analytical moral reasoning behind our beliefs. In this framework, System 1 plays a more prominent role.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 involves intuitions and emotions, which aligns with the answer key's requirement about System 1 referring to intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student accurately describes System 2 as involving 'analytical moral reasoning,' which corresponds to the answer key's description of System 2 as reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student clearly states that 'System 1 plays a more prominent role,' which directly matches the answer key's requirement that System 1 thinking is more dominant than System 2 thinking.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

Representativeness bias occurs when we consider event A to be more typical than event B, leading us to assume that event A is more likely to happen.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions 'representativeness bias' which is close but not the exact term from the answer key ('representativeness heuristic'). However, the student does not clearly connect this to the specific scenario of assuming someone is a fashion model based on their appearance.
- Incorrect: The student's explanation focuses on comparing the likelihood of events A vs B, which is a general and somewhat vague description. It does not explain the key mechanism of estimating category membership based on resemblance to stereotypes, which is the core of the representativeness heuristic as applied to this scenario.

Score: 0.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring means using the first piece of information as a reference point, which is then modified with additional information when making decisions. The primacy effect means that the first information encountered has a stronger impact on forming impressions. Both concepts highlight how initial information disproportionately affects our thought processes.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as using the first piece of information as a reference point, which aligns with the answer key's definition of taking the first information as a starting point.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as the first information having stronger impact on forming impressions, which corresponds to better remembering the first piece of information from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both concepts show how initial information disproportionately affects thought processes, which matches the answer key's point about overreliance on first information.

Score: 1.0

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion describes people's tendency to hold on to their existing assets, whereas risk aversion means we generally avoid taking risks, even when the odds are evenly balanced, such as a 50/50 chance of losing or winning 10 euros.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes loss aversion as 'tendency to hold on to existing assets' which misses the key concept that losses are weighted more heavily than equivalent gains. This describes status quo bias rather than loss aversion.
- Incorrect: The student describes risk aversion as avoiding risks even with fair odds, but this misses the core concept of preferring certainty over uncertainty. The example given actually describes loss aversion (avoiding gambles due to overweighting potential losses).

Score: 0.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias is the tendency to exaggerate the emotional impact that future events will have on us. For example, individuals may overpredict how deeply a breakup will affect them, leading them to avoid ending the relationship despite being unhappy.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as the tendency to exaggerate/overestimate the emotional impact of future events, which matches the answer key definition.
- Correct: The student clearly explains how impact bias prevents breakups by stating people may overpredict how deeply a breakup will affect them, leading to avoidance of ending unhappy relationships.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting describes our inability to accurately anticipate our future emotions. Although we might currently think that experiencing something negative, like paralysis, would lead to intense sadness and hopelessness and make us want to end our life, the reality in that situation could be different.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies affective forecasting as relating to predictions about future emotional states, specifically noting our 'inability to accurately anticipate our future emotions' which captures the essence of the concept.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of the key point about end-of-life decisions by explaining that healthy people might think they would want to die when facing illness/disability, but their actual experience could be different, which aligns with the answer key's example.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

Individuals tend to exaggerate small chances but consider extremely unlikely events as impossible.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that individuals 'exaggerate small chances' which aligns with the answer key point that merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Correct: The student accurately states that 'extremely unlikely events' are considered 'as impossible' which directly matches the answer key point about extremely low probabilities being interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion describes how individuals are inclined to keep their possessions and fear incurring losses. According to prospect theory, small losses are given disproportionately greater importance.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes loss aversion behaviorally (fear of losses, keeping possessions) but fails to explain it in terms of utility as required. The answer does not mention that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities or that the value function is steeper for losses than gains.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected utility theory accounts for individuals' tendencies to conserve their resources and their aversion to risk, unlike expected value theory.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student does not mention the key distinction that expected value theory deals only with financial values while expected utility theory deals with both financial and non-financial values.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected utility theory considers risk aversion while expected value theory does not, which aligns with the answer key point about heuristics and biases.

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesnâ€™t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected value theory suggests selecting the option with the highest value. Expected utility theory advises choosing the option that provides the greatest utility. Multi-attribute utility theory recommends picking the option that offers the highest total utility after evaluating multiple factors. Prospect theory is similar to expected utility theory but also accounts for heuristics and biases.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student only mentions selecting the highest value option but fails to explain that expected value theory is a normative model involving probabilistic financial outcomes.
- Incorrect: The student mentions choosing the greatest utility but doesn't explain that expected utility theory deals with probabilistic outcomes where utility can be subjective rather than just financial.
- Incorrect: The student mentions evaluating multiple factors for highest total utility but doesn't explain that it's a normative model where each attribute has both utility and weight.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that prospect theory is similar to expected utility theory but accounts for heuristics and biases, matching the descriptive/behavioral nature mentioned in the answer key.

Score: 0.25

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease peopleâ€™s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Loss aversion describes people's tendency to hold on to what they already have and avoid losing it. As a result, individuals are reluctant to take risks that could lead to losing existing assets, even if the chance of loss is low and the opportunity is reasonable.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that loss aversion makes people more risk averse and reluctant to take risks. The answer key indicates that loss aversion actually decreases risk aversion and can make people risk-seeking when trying to avoid potential losses.

Score: 0.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves forming associations based on the co-occurrence of events. Classical conditioning occurs when two stimuli are presented close together in time and location, whereas operant conditioning arises from the consequences of behavior, such as rewards or punishments.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as forming associations based on co-occurrence of events, which aligns with learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as occurring when two stimuli are presented close together in time and location, which matches the key concept of learning to associate things that happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as arising from consequences of behavior like rewards or punishments, which directly corresponds to learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

In illusory causation, we assume that one event causes another typically because they appear related. In illusory correlation, we think two events are connected because they occur in sequence, even though this connection is not always accurate.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly identifies that illusory causation involves assuming causation, but incorrectly describes illusory correlation as perceiving connection due to sequence rather than perceiving correlation where none exists. The student also doesn't clearly distinguish that illusory causation starts with actual correlation that's misinterpreted as causation, while illusory correlation involves perceiving correlation that doesn't actually exist.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to â€˜properlyâ€™ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

The Dutch healthcare system functions as a schema because it provides fundamental, background, and heuristic information needed to make decisions when navigating it. In contrast, knowing how to act appropriately at a birthday party is a script, as it offers guidance on the proper behaviors to follow in a social setting.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the Dutch healthcare system as a schema and provides a good explanation that it involves fundamental background knowledge for decision-making, which aligns with schemas being knowledge structures about relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies birthday party behavior as a script and explains it as guidance for proper behaviors in a social setting, which matches the answer key's definition of scripts as social schemas for specific situational behavior.

Score: 1.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

Behaviorists adopt a physical (mechanical) perspective as they focus on the process by which stimuli result in behavior.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that behaviorists adopted the physical stance and provides the accurate reasoning that they focused on the processes by which stimuli result in behavior, which matches the answer key's explanation.

Score: 1.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

Evolutionary psychologists took a functional approach by examining the role behavior played in evolution, specifically considering whether a particular action would provide an advantage to the individual.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that evolutionary psychologists take a functional approach, which aligns with the design stance. They demonstrate understanding that this involves examining behaviors in terms of their evolutionary advantages/functions, which is the core principle of the design stance - analyzing systems based on their purpose or function.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Distinct: presenting a treat to my dog makes its tail wag, which as far as I know, is not a typical reaction for most things. Consistent: my dog's tail wags every time I show it a treat. Plausible: based on what I know, treats make the dog happy, and a happy dog wags its tail. Contiguous in time and space: the dog's tail wags only after I display the treat, not beforehand. Similar in cause and effect: when I kick the ball, it causes the ball to move.

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies distinctness and provides a relevant example showing that the effect (tail wagging) follows the specific cause (treat) but not other events.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies consistency and demonstrates understanding that the effect always follows the cause with their dog example.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies plausibility and shows understanding that common sense supports the causal relationship between treats and tail wagging.
- Incorrect: Student mentions timing but misses the spatial component of contiguity, and the example doesn't clearly demonstrate both temporal and spatial proximity.
- Incorrect: Student provides an example (kicking ball causing movement) but doesn't explain how cause and effect superficially resemble each other, missing the key concept of similarity.

Score: 0.6

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Participatory bias occurs when we align with the beliefs and behaviors of our ingroup to demonstrate loyalty. Availability bias happens when examples of moral outrage are more easily recalled, making us overestimate how often such behavior occurs. Believing that morally outrageous acts are common leads us to reinforce this notion to prove our moral correctness and loyalty to the group, which in turn spreads the idea further and reinforces the availability bias.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies 'participatory bias' instead of negativity bias. While they describe a real phenomenon about ingroup alignment, this doesn't match the answer key's focus on negativity bias as the tendency to seek out or weight negative information more heavily.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies availability bias (though they call it 'availability bias' rather than 'availability heuristic') and accurately describes it as the tendency to overestimate frequency based on how easily examples come to mind.
- Incorrect: While the student attempts to explain how the two biases work together, their explanation focuses on ingroup loyalty and moral correctness rather than the correct mechanism described in the answer key - that negativity bias causes us to attend to morally outraged content, which then feeds into availability heuristic.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

Magical contagion arises when characteristics from one area extend into another. Here, the concept of viruses and bacteria spreading biologically has influenced the belief that we can acquire something harmful by using an object that previously belonged to someone we dislike.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that biological contagion concepts (viruses and bacteria spreading) are being inappropriately applied to the social/psychological domain (acquiring harmful properties from objects belonging to disliked people), which matches the answer key's requirement about cross-domain misapplication.

Score: 1.0

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A delusional conspiracy theory is an extreme type of conspiracy theoryâ€”beliefs that major events are controlled by influential individuals attempting to stay hiddenâ€”that is completely irrational and cannot be justified by natural explanations. In contrast, a non-delusional conspiracy theory may be based on truth, unlike its delusional version.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student identifies irrationality as a key distinguishing factor but fails to mention the crucial element of social acceptance. The answer key specifies that a conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both irrational AND not commonly accepted, but the student only addresses the rationality component and doesn't discuss the social acceptance criterion.

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

Perceiving order in chaos, holding supernatural beliefs, and assigning intentionality to things that lack it.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'perceiving order in chaos' which matches 'seeing patterns in randomness' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'holding supernatural beliefs' which corresponds to 'believing paranormal phenomena' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'assigning intentionality to things that lack it' which matches 'attributing agency where it does not exist' from the answer key.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you donâ€™t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Giving wrong answers during practice quizzes can create a false feeling of mental ease, making you think you grasp the content and can make swift decisions, when in fact, this is not the case.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes fluency illusion or overconfidence effects, but does not address the specific mechanism asked about - how incorrect answers can interfere with learning the correct information. The answer key focuses on source amnesia, proactive interference, or continued-influence effect, none of which are mentioned or implied in the student's response.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

Politicians aim for their supporters to echo these messages, fostering a stronger connection to the group (participatory propaganda), even if the supporters cannot logically recognize that the information is false.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes participatory propaganda and group connection mechanisms but does not identify the key psychological mechanism from the answer key: mere exposure effect (tendency to prefer familiar things) or the illusory-truth effect. The answer focuses on group dynamics rather than the cognitive bias that makes repeated messages more attractive through familiarity.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Major depressive disorder leads individuals to have a more pessimistic outlook, making them more prone to expecting negative outcomes and therefore less likely to make accurate predictions about the future.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that depression makes people less accurate at predictions due to pessimism. The answer key indicates that people with major depressive disorder are actually MORE accurate because they have reduced optimism bias, not that they are less accurate due to excessive pessimism.

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

When sensory information is uncertain, prior beliefs have a stronger impact on perception, causing perception to lean more towards those prior beliefs.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when sensory information is uncertain/unreliable, prior beliefs have a stronger influence on perception, which directly matches the key concept from the answer key.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You donâ€™t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other peopleâ€™s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

Pre-conventional morality centers on rewards and punishments, where individuals act out of reciprocity (like doing favors in return). Conventional morality is guided by concern for others' feelings and adherence to authority. Post-conventional morality involves evaluating moral principles independently, sometimes leading to protest when personal ethics conflict with established rules.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes pre-conventional morality as focusing on rewards and punishments, which aligns with the answer key's description of obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes conventional morality as being guided by concern for others' feelings and adherence to authority, which matches the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly describes post-conventional morality as involving independent evaluation of moral principles, which aligns with the answer key's focus on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

The causal model suggests that simply knowing the outcome isn't sufficient to create hindsight bias; there must also be a likely cause involved. This is evident in how we find it easier to focus on what actually occurred rather than on alternative possibilities that didn't happen. Because it is difficult to recreate our initial judgment, hindsight bias arises.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student does not clearly define what a causal model is. While they mention causes being involved, they don't explain that a causal model is a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that causal models contribute to hindsight bias by making us focus on what actually occurred rather than alternatives, which aligns with the concept that events seem more inevitable than they were.

Score: 0.5

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

After knowing the result, it becomes difficult to forget it. Therefore, when you try to recall your original judgment, it's challenging to ignore the outcome, making it simpler to focus on what actually occurred rather than on alternative possibilities that didn't happen, which causes hindsight bias (also known as the curse of knowledge).

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly explains that newly learned information (the outcome) cannot be avoided when trying to recall past judgments, which is the core mechanism of hindsight bias. They also correctly identify this as the curse of knowledge, demonstrating full understanding of the concept.

Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing involves striving to select the very best option, whereas satisficing means choosing an option that is satisfactory or adequate. Neuroticism is linked to maximizing.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as 'striving to select the very best option' which aligns with the key point of 'trying to make the best choice'.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as 'choosing an option that is satisfactory or adequate' which matches the key point of 'making a good-enough choice'.
- Correct: The student correctly states that 'Neuroticism is linked to maximizing' which corresponds to the answer key point that high neuroticism leads to adopting the maximizing decision style.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

For students to actively participate in a course, they must be motivated from within. My top priority would be selecting supplementary materials, such as a textbook, that are interesting and engaging. In lectures, I would use examples tied to everyday life to help students see how the content applies to their personal experiences. I would also encourage discussions by posing questions and inviting students to share their views, helping them feel included and valued. Personally, I think fill-in-the-blank questions strike a good balance between multiple-choice and open-ended formats, though I prefer open-ended ones because they capture more complexity and avoid the unfairness of guessing. I also appreciate individual writing assignments, provided they donâ€™t become overwhelming alongside exam preparation. Group projects can be unpredictable depending on teammates, but my motivation comes from wanting to get into my preferred Masterâ€™s program and ultimately pursue what makes me happy, which I consider intrinsic motivation.
