## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

System 1 thinking operates intuitively, while System 2 thinking functions more rationally, with System 1 being the more dominant of the two in this framework.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 thinking operates intuitively, which aligns with the answer key's requirement that System 1 refers to intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 2 thinking functions rationally, which matches the answer key's requirement that System 2 refers to reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student correctly states that System 1 is more dominant than System 2, which directly satisfies the answer key's requirement about System 1 dominance.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

The representativeness heuristic refers to assessing the likelihood that an item fits into a certain category based on how closely it matches the typical characteristics of that category.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process in this scenario.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that the representativeness heuristic involves estimating likelihood of category membership based on similarity to typical characteristics/stereotypes of that category, which matches the answer key's explanation.

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring involves forming your initial belief, while the primacy effect means that the information you receive first greatly influences how you form impressions and remember things. Both concepts rely on the initial information presented.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that anchoring involves forming initial beliefs based on first information, which aligns with the concept of taking the first piece of information as a starting point.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as first information greatly influencing impression formation and memory, which captures the essence of better remembering first information.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both concepts rely on initial information presented, which demonstrates understanding of their common overreliance on first information.

Score: 1.0

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Risk aversion involves steering clear of risks, while loss aversion focuses on avoiding losses. When being risk-averse, we opt for the option with the greatest certainty, whereas loss-averse individuals place more importance on preventing losses.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves placing more importance on preventing/avoiding losses, which aligns with the key concept that losses are weighed more heavily than gains.
- Correct: The student accurately describes risk aversion as opting for options with greater certainty and steering clear of risks, which matches the answer key's definition of preferring certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 1.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias means we exaggerate how strongly we will feel in the future after making a choice. For example, individuals believe they will be lonely and extremely unhappy after a breakup, which leads them to remain in the relationship to avoid experiencing those emotions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as exaggerating how strongly we will feel in the future, which captures the essence of overestimating the impact of future events on our feelings.
- Correct: The student accurately explains how impact bias prevents breakups by describing how people overestimate negative emotions (loneliness, extreme unhappiness) after a breakup, leading them to stay in relationships to avoid these anticipated feelings.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves making decisions by anticipating how we will feel in the future. In end-of-life choices, this means deciding what we want for ourselves when we might be disabled or seriously ill, requiring us to estimate our future emotional state and preferences in that situation.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that affective forecasting involves predicting future emotional states and feelings, which aligns with the answer key's definition of 'predictions about our own future emotional state.'
- Incorrect: While the student mentions end-of-life decisions and anticipating future preferences, they don't capture the key insight that healthy people's predictions about preferring death when sick may not match their actual preferences when they become sick.

Score: 0.5

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

People tend to underestimate low probabilities, but there is a distinction between moderately low and extremely low probabilities. Extremely low probabilities are often perceived as impossible, while moderately low probabilities are underestimated only to a small extent.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student states that merely low probabilities are underestimated, but according to prospect theory and the answer key, they are actually overestimated.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that extremely low probabilities are often perceived as impossible, which aligns with the answer key's point about them being interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 0.5

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

We usually place greater importance on losses than on gains, assigning more significance to losses.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion means losses are given greater weight or importance than gains, which captures the core concept that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

1. Expected value theory focuses solely on financial results, whereas expected utility theory considers both financial and non-financial outcomes. 2. Expected utility theory accounts for risk aversion, unlike expected value theory.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory focuses on financial results while expected utility theory considers both financial and non-financial outcomes, which matches the first point in the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly states that expected utility theory accounts for risk aversion while expected value theory does not, which aligns with the second point in the answer key about expected utility theory considering risk aversion versus expected value theory not considering heuristics and biases.

Score: 1.0

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

1. Expected value theory: a method to determine the best financial choice. 2. Expected utility theory: a method to evaluate options that have various attributes, each with its own utility and probability. 3. Multi-attribute utility theory: a method to evaluate options with multiple attributes, each having different utilities and weights. 4. Prospect theory: a method to analyze whether individuals are inclined to spend their money.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as related to financial choices, which aligns with the answer key's description of a normative model with financial outcomes and probabilities.
- Incorrect: The student mentions attributes and probability for expected utility theory, but misses the key distinction that it's like expected value theory except outcomes have subjective utility rather than just financial value.
- Correct: The student correctly describes multi-attribute utility theory as evaluating options with multiple attributes that have different utilities and weights, matching the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student's description of prospect theory as analyzing spending inclinations is incorrect. The answer key describes it as a descriptive behavioral model similar to expected utility theory but incorporating heuristics and biases.

Score: 0.5

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency for individuals to place greater importance on avoiding losses than on acquiring equivalent gains. This leads to increased risk aversion, as people prefer to avoid losing rather than to strive for potential gains.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that loss aversion leads to increased risk aversion. According to the answer key, loss aversion actually decreases people's tendency to be risk averse and can make them risk-seeking when trying to avoid potential losses.

Score: 0.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves learning through the recognition of covariation—classical conditioning occurs when a cause and effect happen in immediate succession, while operant conditioning involves learning based on rewards or punishments that come after a behavior. The key distinction is that operant conditioning is driven by consequences like rewards or punishments, whereas classical conditioning happens naturally.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as learning through recognition of covariation, which matches the answer key's definition of learning associations through covariation.
- Incorrect: The student describes classical conditioning as 'cause and effect in immediate succession' which is not accurate. The answer key emphasizes association of things that happen together in time and space, not a cause-effect relationship.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies operant conditioning as learning based on rewards or punishments following behavior, which aligns with the answer key's definition of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory correlation occurs when people believe a relationship exists between two variables even though none actually exists, whereas illusory causation involves a perceived cause-and-effect link based on an actual correlation, but the causal connection is mistakenly assumed. In other words, illusory causation includes a real correlation, while illusory correlation does not.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly distinguishes that illusory correlation involves perceiving a relationship between variables that don't actually correlate, while illusory causation involves misinterpreting an actual correlation as a causal relationship. The explanation accurately captures the key difference that illusory causation starts with a real correlation but misattributes causality, whereas illusory correlation involves no actual correlation at all.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

The first example is a schema, as it involves understanding knowledge through the relationships between concepts, which creates expectations about the healthcare system. The second example is a script, since it pertains to social knowledge regarding typical scenarios, specifically a birthday party.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the healthcare system as a schema and provides accurate reasoning about it involving knowledge and relationships between concepts that create expectations.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies birthday party behavior as a script and accurately explains it as social knowledge about typical scenarios, which aligns with the concept of behavioral expectations in specific situations.

Score: 1.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

The intentional stance focuses on understanding thoughts and actions. While behaviorism explains behavior in terms of responses to stimuli, the intentional stance offers the most effective level of analysis.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the intentional stance as the behaviorist approach, when behaviorists actually adopted the physical stance by focusing on measurable stimulus-response mechanisms rather than mental states or intentions.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

Design, as this perspective aims to clarify the purpose and function of psychological processes.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the design stance and provides an accurate justification that evolutionary psychologists focus on the purpose and function of psychological processes, which aligns with the design stance's emphasis on understanding systems in terms of their intended function or design.

Score: 1.0

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

A causes B when: 1. it is unique—B occurs solely after A and not after other factors; 2. it is consistent—B always happens after A; 3. it is reasonable—common sense supports that B results from A; 4. it is immediate—B happens right after A in both time and location; 5. it is analogous—the relationship between A and B is similar to other known cause-and-effect pairs.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies distinctness/specificity as uniqueness, explaining that B occurs solely after A and not after other factors, which matches the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes consistency as B always happening after A, which aligns perfectly with the answer key definition.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies plausibility as reasonableness, stating that common sense supports B resulting from A, which matches the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes contiguity in time and space as immediacy, explaining that B happens right after A in both time and location, which aligns with the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student describes similarity as analogous relationships to other known cause-and-effect pairs, but the answer key refers to superficial resemblance between A and B themselves, not analogies to other relationships.

Score: 0.8

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

1. Availability heuristic: the likelihood of an event is judged by how easily examples or related ideas can be recalled — on the internet, negative aspects of moral outrage are more prominent than positive ones. 2. Negativity bias: we tend to focus on negative emotional information — seeing more negative content about moral outrage on social media makes these instances more noticeable, leading us to overestimate the frequency of moral outrage.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly describes negativity bias as focusing on negative emotional information rather than the tendency to seek out or place more weight on negative information like morally outraged content.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the availability heuristic as judging likelihood based on how easily examples can be recalled, which aligns with the answer key's definition.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of how these biases work together - negativity bias makes moral outrage content more noticeable, which through availability heuristic leads to overestimating frequency, matching the answer key's explanation.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

In biology, a virus can enter your body through an opening or similar means. People often extend this idea to other areas, believing that you can catch a virus by using objects handled by someone you strongly dislike.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that biological contagion concepts (virus transmission) are being inappropriately applied to social/psychological situations (disliking objects used by disliked people), demonstrating understanding of cross-domain transfer of framework theories.

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A delusional conspiracy theory is accepted by only a few individuals, whereas a non-delusional conspiracy is believed by a wider audience and is consequently considered a conspiracy theory.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student only identifies the 'not commonly accepted' criterion but fails to mention that a delusional conspiracy theory must also be an 'irrational belief.' The answer is incomplete as it misses the key distinction about irrationality.

Score: 0.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

Your answer:

1. accepting straightforward explanations 2. identifying as male 3. having narcissistic traits

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'accepting straightforward explanations' which corresponds to 'believing in simple explanations for complex events' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'identifying as male' which corresponds to 'being a man' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'having narcissistic traits' which corresponds to 'being narcissistic' from the answer key.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

The tendency to believe, after an event has occurred, that one would have predicted or expected the outcome.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's answer describes hindsight bias, which is unrelated to the question about how incorrect quiz answers can interfere with learning. The answer key requires understanding of source amnesia, proactive interference, or the continued-influence effect - none of which are addressed in the student's response.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

Mere exposure refers to the tendency to favor things we encounter often.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies mere exposure as the psychological mechanism and accurately describes it as the tendency to favor things we encounter frequently, which matches the answer key's definition of preferring familiar things.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

No, it actually improves their accuracy.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that major depressive disorder does not make people less accurate at predictions, and that it actually improves accuracy, which aligns with the key point about reduced overly optimistic tendencies in depression.

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

As the trustworthiness of sensory information diminishes, the impact of prior beliefs grows, causing perceptions to rely more heavily on those prior beliefs.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when sensory information becomes less reliable (diminishes in trustworthiness), prior beliefs have greater influence on perception, causing perceptions to rely more heavily on expectations rather than sensory input.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

1. Pre-conventional: moral decisions are guided by the desire to gain rewards or avoid punishment, focusing on self-interest and limited give-and-take. 2. Conventional: moral decisions are made with the aim of appearing good to others and following laws, while considering others' feelings. 3. Post-conventional: moral decisions are grounded in universal ethical principles, recognizing that moral judgments can sometimes be in conflict.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the pre-conventional level as being guided by desire to gain rewards or avoid punishment, which matches the answer key's focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as aiming to appear good to others and following laws while considering others' feelings, which aligns with the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model refers to people's tendency to create logical cause-and-effect stories about events that occurred, which are more readily recalled than events that did not happen. This ease of recalling causal stories contributes to hindsight bias by influencing how judgments are formed.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a causal model involves creating logical cause-and-effect stories about events, which aligns with the answer key's description of a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Incorrect: While the student mentions that causal models contribute to hindsight bias through ease of recall and judgment formation, they miss the key mechanism that events seem more inevitable than they actually were, which is the core way causal models contribute to hindsight bias.

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

If we find out the result, we inevitably must consider the new information.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that newly acquired information (the result) inevitably influences our judgment when looking back, which aligns with the key concept that we cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account when estimating past likelihood judgments.

Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing involves selecting the best or most optimal option, while satisficing means picking an option that is sufficiently good. Those who maximize are more prone to exhibiting the neuroticism personality trait.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as selecting the best or most optimal option, which aligns with the answer key's definition of 'trying to make the best choice'.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as picking an option that is sufficiently good, which matches the answer key's definition of 'making a good-enough choice'.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states the relationship direction - they claim maximizers are more prone to neuroticism, but the answer key asks which decision style someone high in neuroticism would adopt (neuroticism leads to maximizing, not the reverse).

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

I believe the assignment provided additional engagement with the material, which motivated me to study. Thanks to the assignment, I had already covered some content, making it easier to begin preparing for the exam. It’s important to me that the teacher can review the exam if needed, especially since we might miss some points and don’t fully trust AI. Overall, I found the course interesting, and it didn’t bother me that the exam was graded by AI.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's response does not address the question asked. The question asks how they would approach teaching a university course with limited resources while ensuring student engagement, but the student instead provides feedback about their own experience as a student in this course. They discuss how assignments helped their learning and their feelings about AI grading, but do not propose any teaching strategies or methods for engaging students within resource constraints.
