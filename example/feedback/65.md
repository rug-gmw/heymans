## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

System 1 would be the more dominant of the two because it reflects how our intuitions and emotions influence our moral beliefs and shape our moral feelings. In this framework, System 1 activates initially, followed by System 2, which attempts to logically justify the emotionally driven decision.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 involves intuitions and emotions, which aligns with the answer key's requirement to explain System 1 as the role of intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student implicitly describes System 2 as attempting to 'logically justify' decisions, which corresponds to the answer key's definition of System 2 as reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student clearly states that System 1 is 'more dominant of the two' and explains that it activates initially before System 2, which directly satisfies the answer key's requirement that System 1 is more dominant than System 2.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

This is the representativeness heuristic, where we assess the likelihood of something being correct based on how closely A (in this case, the student) resembles a typical example or stereotype, such as the fashion model.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive bias in this scenario.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that the representativeness heuristic involves assessing likelihood based on how closely someone resembles a typical example or stereotype, though they mistakenly refer to 'the student' instead of 'the colleague' in their explanation.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring refers to the tendency for the initial piece of information encountered to serve as a reference point in memory, affecting how subsequent information is interpreted. New evidence tends to be adjusted toward this initial anchor. Similarly, the primacy effect describes how the first traits we learn about someone, such as in a first impression, shape our overall perception of that person. Both concepts share the idea that early information significantly impacts all later information and leads to an overall judgment that leans toward the initial or primary details.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as the tendency for initial information to serve as a reference point, which aligns with the answer key's description of taking the first piece of information as the starting point.
- Incorrect: The student describes the primacy effect in terms of first impressions and trait perception rather than memory recall. The answer key specifically refers to better remembering the first piece of information, which is not addressed in the student's response.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both concepts involve early/initial information significantly impacting later judgments, which corresponds to the answer key's point about overreliance on the first piece of information.

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency of people to feel the pain of losing, say 10 euros, more intensely than the pleasure of gaining the same amount. In contrast, risk aversion involves avoiding uncertain situations; we tend to favor guaranteed outcomes over risky ones, and even when a gamble has equal chances of winning or losing, we are less inclined to take it compared to when the odds of winning are better.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly explains loss aversion as feeling losses more intensely than equivalent gains, using a concrete example of 10 euros. This matches the answer key's definition of weighing losses more heavily than gains.
- Correct: The student accurately describes risk aversion as avoiding uncertain situations and preferring guaranteed outcomes over risky ones. This aligns with the answer key's definition of preferring certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 1.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias influences affective forecasting by causing us to overestimate both the intensity and duration of how an event will affect us in the future. This tendency might discourage people from ending relationships because they anticipate more pain than they are likely to experience.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies impact bias as overestimating how future events will affect us, mentioning both intensity and duration which shows a thorough understanding of the concept.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that impact bias prevents breakups because people anticipate more pain than they would actually experience, which directly addresses how overestimating negative feelings keeps people in unhappy relationships.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting refers to our attempt to predict how we will feel in the future, but we are often inaccurate due to several biases. Impact bias leads us to overestimate how long and how strongly an event will affect us. Focalism causes us to concentrate only on that one event, ignoring other factors that will also influence our feelings. Emotional evanescence means we forget that the intensity of emotions fades over time. Sense-making reduces the impact once we have understood the situation. These factors cause us to overestimate our future feelings, which influences how we write our wills. Additionally, projection bias makes us assume we will feel in the future the way we do now, underestimating how much our feelings will change. Taking these biases into account when drafting a will is crucial to making decisions that truly reflect our and our family’s needs during illness; otherwise, the will may not align with our real wishes when the time comes.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines affective forecasting as our attempt to predict how we will feel in the future, which matches the answer key's definition of predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of the key concept that our predictions about future preferences may not match our actual preferences when the situation occurs, specifically mentioning that wills may not align with real wishes when the time comes, which parallels the answer key's point about healthy people predicting they'd prefer to die when sick but potentially feeling differently when actually sick.

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

Yes, it does vary; extremely low probabilities are perceived as zero and considered impossible, while low probabilities tend to be overestimated and viewed as closer to the average.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that low probabilities tend to be overestimated, which aligns with the answer key's first point.
- Correct: The student accurately states that extremely low probabilities are perceived as zero and considered impossible, which matches the answer key's second point about being interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency for people to feel the pain of losing a certain amount more intensely than the pleasure of gaining the same amount. As a result, losses have a greater emotional impact than equivalent gains.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly describes the behavioral phenomenon of loss aversion but fails to address the specific question about how this is expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory. The answer does not mention that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities or that the value function is steeper for losses than gains.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory ignores biases and focuses solely on monetary amounts, while expected utility theory accounts for risk aversion and deals with subjective utility, representing the personal value of desirability.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory focuses on monetary amounts while expected utility theory deals with subjective utility/personal value, which captures the distinction between financial and non-financial values.
- Correct: The student accurately states that expected value theory ignores biases while expected utility theory accounts for risk aversion, directly matching the second key point about heuristics/biases and risk aversion.

Score: 1.0

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

The Expected Value Theory model applies only to monetary values, calculating EV by multiplying each monetary outcome by its probability and then summing these products. It is limited because it only addresses monetary values and ignores biases. Expected Utility Theory improves on this by focusing on utility, which represents the subjective desirability of outcomes, and it incorporates risk aversion. Here, EV is found by multiplying utilities by their probabilities and adding them up. Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT) accounts for multiple attributes by assigning weights to them instead of probabilities, using utility values; however, it can become complex, leading some to prefer approaches like robust satisficing. Prospect Theory builds on Expected Utility Theory but includes more biases such as risk aversion, loss aversion, overweighting of small gains and losses, and treating extreme probabilities as certainties or impossibilities. It calculates subjective value using weighting (w) and value (v) functions and interprets all outcomes as gains or losses. Unlike the other three, which are normative models, Prospect Theory is descriptive.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies Expected Value Theory as dealing with monetary outcomes, probabilities, and multiplication/summation. They also note its limitation of only addressing monetary values.
- Correct: The student accurately describes Expected Utility Theory as an improvement over Expected Value Theory that focuses on utility (subjective desirability) rather than just monetary values, and mentions risk aversion as a key component.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies Multi-Attribute Utility Theory as dealing with multiple attributes that have weights and utilities, accurately capturing the core concept of this normative model.
- Correct: The student excellently describes Prospect Theory as a descriptive model that builds on Expected Utility Theory but incorporates biases and heuristics. They correctly distinguish it as descriptive rather than normative, which is a key differentiator.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Loss aversion means we fear losses more than we enjoy gains. As a result, when faced with a potential loss, we tend to take more risks in an attempt to prevent it.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion leads people to take more risks when trying to avoid losses, which demonstrates understanding that loss aversion can decrease risk aversion and make people risk-seeking in loss domains.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves learning that one stimulus can signal the arrival of another. In classical conditioning, two stimuli are linked, such as when a dog hears a bell and begins to salivate because it anticipates food, even if no food is presented. Operant conditioning, on the other hand, focuses on punishment and reinforcement, which can be either positive or negative. Positive means receiving something, while negative involves having something removed.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as a form of learning involving associations, though they frame it as 'signaling' rather than 'covariation'. The core concept of learning associations is present.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning with a proper example of associating two stimuli (bell and food), demonstrating understanding that things happening together lead to learned associations.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies operant conditioning as involving punishment and reinforcement, which aligns with the key concept that actions cause rewards or punishments. The explanation of positive/negative reinforcement shows good understanding.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation occurs when we mistakenly believe that A causes B, even though there is no actual causal connection, as a way to make sense of events. Illusory correlations happen when we assume that A and B are related or vary together, despite this not being the case.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that illusory causation involves mistakenly believing in a causal relationship where none exists (A causes B without actual causal connection) and that illusory correlation involves perceiving a relationship between variables that don't actually correlate (A and B appearing related when they're not). This demonstrates understanding of the key distinction between incorrectly inferring causation versus incorrectly perceiving correlation.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

The script describes appropriate behavior at a Dutch birthday party, focusing on a sequence of actions that tend to be consistent and therefore frequently repeated. In contrast, the Dutch healthcare system operates more like a schema, which is background knowledge you possess. It serves as a framework for what to expect and how to understand related aspects.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the Dutch healthcare system as a schema and provides an accurate explanation that it represents background knowledge and a framework for understanding, which aligns with the concept of schemas as knowledge structures about relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies birthday party behavior as a script and provides a good explanation focusing on sequences of actions that are consistent and repeated, which captures the essence of scripts as behavioral templates for specific situations.

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

They took a mechanical or physical approach, concentrating on biology and more tangible symptoms to explain behavior.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that behaviorists adopted the physical stance (referring to it as 'mechanical or physical approach') and provides appropriate reasoning by noting they focused on 'biology and more tangible symptoms' which aligns with the answer key's emphasis on focusing on processes that cause stimuli to result in behavior.

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

This refers to the design stance, which focuses on the function and the intended purpose of something, such as an object or, in this case, ingroup favoritism.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the design stance and demonstrates understanding that it focuses on function and purpose, appropriately applying this to the psychological process example given.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

We assume causality based on how plausible it is that A causes B. We consider whether A happens before B, establishing a temporal sequence. We also look for differences in the background, asking if A is something unusual in the causal context, rather than a common factor like breathing or life. Contiguity is important too—whether A occurs close to B in time and space. Lastly, we evaluate similarity, checking if A resembles B enough to suggest a meaningful connection.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions 'differences in the background' and 'unusual in the causal context' but does not clearly identify this as distinctness/specificity - the concept that B follows A but not other events.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention consistency - that B always follows A. They mention temporal sequence but not the consistent relationship between A and B.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies plausibility as assuming causality based on how plausible it is that A causes B.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies contiguity in time and space, noting that A should occur close to B in both dimensions.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies similarity, checking if A resembles B enough to suggest a meaningful connection.

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Confirmation bias leads you to seek out information that supports your opinion, resulting in more examples that confirm your view. This increased availability of supporting examples then triggers the availability heuristic, causing you to become more confident and to overestimate the likelihood of your opinion being correct.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies confirmation bias instead of negativity bias. While confirmation bias involves seeking supporting information, the key point is that negativity bias specifically drives attention to negative/outraged content, not just confirming information.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the availability heuristic and explains that increased examples lead to overestimation of frequency/probability, which aligns with the answer key's definition.
- Incorrect: While the student describes a valid psychological mechanism, they miss the specific connection between negativity bias and moral outrage. Their explanation focuses on opinion confirmation rather than how negativity bias increases exposure to morally outraged content.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

We possess framework theories that help us understand and interpret events. These frameworks are divided into three areas: Biology, Psychology, and Physics. Magical contagion involves a cross-domain error, where we mistakenly apply knowledge from one domain to another. In this case, biological concepts are incorrectly used to explain a social (psychological) situation.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that magical contagion involves applying biological concepts of contagion to the social/psychological domain, which matches the answer key's requirement about incorrectly applying the biological domain concept to the social domain.

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

Delusional refers to an irrational belief that is not accepted by the broader culture. Conspiracy theorists believe that those in power secretly orchestrate events. A delusional conspiracy theory is one that is not commonly believed and can be shaped by cultural context, such as the idea that Americans were responsible for 9/11. In contrast, a non-delusional belief is one that has gained widespread acceptance; for instance, in some Eastern societies, the 9/11 theory has become relatively common.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a delusional conspiracy theory requires both irrationality and lack of common acceptance, while non-delusional theories have widespread acceptance. The student demonstrates understanding by providing relevant examples and noting how cultural context affects what is considered commonly accepted.

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

Desire to feel empowered, but end up feeling isolated, disconnected from reality, and less intelligent.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions 'desire to feel empowered' which could relate to narcissistic tendencies, but this connection is not clearly established and doesn't directly match any of the specific factors from the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student describes outcomes ('feeling isolated, disconnected from reality') rather than cognitive/personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking as requested in the question.
- Incorrect: The student mentions 'less intelligent' as an outcome, but the answer key requires identifying low intelligence as a contributing factor, not as a result of conspiratorial thinking.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

When we hear or remember something, it can keep affecting us because, for instance, we might forget where it came from—known as source amnesia—and then become uncertain about the correct information.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies source amnesia as the key mechanism and explains how forgetting the source of information (that the initial answer was incorrect) can lead to confusion about what is correct, which directly addresses how incorrect quiz answers can interfere with learning.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

The more acquainted we are with something, the easier it is to retain in our memory. Additionally, even if we later forget where it came from, it can still affect us regardless of our opinion of the source.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the core mechanism of mere exposure - that familiarity increases preference/retention. While they don't use the exact term 'mere exposure effect,' they demonstrate understanding of the psychological principle that repeated exposure to information makes it more influential, which is the key concept being tested.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Yes, individuals experiencing a major depressive episode tend to have a negativity bias, causing them to overestimate the probability of negative events occurring because they concentrate more on unfavorable aspects.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that people with major depressive disorder are less accurate due to overestimating negative events. The answer key indicates they are actually more accurate because they show reduced optimism bias, not that they overestimate negative probabilities.

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

When the reliability of sensory information or evidence diminishes, the prior beliefs have a greater impact, causing the posterior to lean more toward the prior.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when sensory reliability decreases, prior beliefs have greater impact on perception. The use of Bayesian terminology ('posterior lean toward the prior') demonstrates understanding of the underlying mechanism.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

The preconventional level involves making moral choices driven by avoiding punishment, seeking rewards, and acting according to personal interest and influences. The conventional level focuses on understanding social norms and making decisions that uphold laws and maintain order. The postconventional level represents a higher moral reasoning stage, where decisions are guided by principles of justice, fairness, and ethical standards.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the pre-conventional level as being driven by avoiding punishment and seeking rewards, which matches the answer key's focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as focusing on understanding social norms and maintaining order, which aligns with the answer key's emphasis on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the post-conventional level as involving higher moral reasoning guided by principles of justice, fairness, and ethical standards, which matches the answer key's focus on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

The causal model affects hindsight bias by leading us to try to understand events by identifying reasons behind them. This tendency makes hindsight bias more probable because when we find explanations, we become more certain that we knew the outcome all along since it appears logical.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes what a causal model does but doesn't clearly define what it is - a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student correctly explains that finding explanations makes events seem more logical and inevitable, which contributes to hindsight bias by making us feel we 'knew it all along'.

Score: 0.5

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Learning contributes to hindsight bias in several ways. For instance, in the SARA model, the most recent information (the actual outcome) reinforces related units, increasing cognitive fluency and confidence in the decision. In the RAFT model, learning involves updating knowledge after receiving new information, so the actual outcome becomes readily accessible in memory. Since we have discovered and stored the outcome, we tend to believe we knew it all along, which creates hindsight bias.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that learning contributes to hindsight bias by explaining that newly learned information (the actual outcome) becomes integrated into memory and affects our ability to accurately recall our previous judgments. While they use specific model terminology (SARA, RAFT), their core explanation aligns with the answer key's point that we cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account when estimating past likelihood judgments.

- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing involves striving for the best possible result, while satisficing focuses on finding an outcome that is simply good enough. Neuroticism is linked to maximizing likely because the pursuit of perfection can lead to greater dissatisfaction.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as striving for the best possible result, which aligns with the answer key's definition of trying to make the best choice.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as finding an outcome that is simply good enough, which matches the answer key's definition of making a good-enough choice.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that neuroticism is linked to maximizing and provides reasonable reasoning about the pursuit of perfection leading to dissatisfaction, demonstrating understanding of the connection.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

We found that having too many options can cause people to lose interest. Therefore, it might be better to provide fewer materials so they engage more deeply, which would also reduce grading effort. Alternatively, one could opt for a fully open exam focusing on higher-level knowledge that requires system 2 thinking, demonstrating a deeper understanding; grading could then be more lenient, mainly ensuring students engaged with the content. This approach could apply to either exams or assignments. In contrast, multiple-choice exams are easier for teachers to grade but may allow students to rely on shortcuts and recognition.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement by drawing on course concepts (choice overload, system 1/2 thinking) and proposing multiple practical solutions including reducing materials for deeper engagement, using open-ended assessments focusing on higher-level thinking, and comparing different assessment formats with their trade-offs between grading efficiency and learning depth.

Score: 1.0
