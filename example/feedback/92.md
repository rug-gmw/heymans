## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

System 1 represents moral intuition, while System 2 involves morals influenced by additional factors. System 1 tends to be the most dominant.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 represents moral intuition, which aligns with the answer key's requirement for System 1 to refer to intuitions or emotion.
- Incorrect: The student's description of System 2 as 'morals influenced by additional factors' is vague and doesn't clearly identify it as reasoning, rational thought, or deliberation as required by the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly states that System 1 tends to be the most dominant, which matches the answer key's requirement that System 1 thinking is more dominant than System 2.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

Representative heuristic: we assume that someone or something belongs to a certain group based on how closely they resemble other members of that group.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive bias in this scenario.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that the representativeness heuristic involves judging category membership based on similarity to typical group members, which matches the answer key's explanation about estimating likelihood based on resemblance to stereotypes.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Primacy effect: information given at the beginning is more readily recalled than information provided afterwards. Anchoring effect: the initial information acts as a reference point (or anchor), influencing how subsequent information is interpreted. In both effects, the information presented first has a greater influence compared to information presented later.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as using initial information as a reference point that influences interpretation of subsequent information, which aligns with the answer key's definition of taking first information as a starting point.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as better recall of information given at the beginning compared to later information, which matches the answer key's definition.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both effects share the common feature of first information having greater influence than later information, which captures the essence of overreliance on first information from the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

risk aversion: individuals generally prefer to steer clear of risks

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student did not address loss aversion at all, which is a key component of the question asking for the difference between the two concepts.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that risk aversion involves preferring to avoid risks, which aligns with the preference for certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 0.5

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate how much a situation will affect your future emotions, which might stop someone from ending a relationship due to worries about feeling very sad or lonely.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as overestimating how much a situation will affect future emotions, which captures the essence of overestimating the impact of future events on feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly explains that impact bias prevents breakups because people worry about feeling very sad or lonely, which demonstrates understanding that they overestimate how bad the breakup will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves predicting how we will feel in the future. It is often inaccurate because people frequently believe they won’t want to continue living when facing (mental) illness, but when the situation actually occurs, their feelings often change. This is why it’s important to consider carefully when making decisions about end-of-life care.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines affective forecasting as predicting how we will feel in the future, which matches the answer key's definition of predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that healthy people may predict they won't want to continue living when facing illness, but their feelings often change when actually in that situation, which aligns with the answer key's point about preferences changing from prediction to reality.

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

People tend to undervalue very small probabilities, and this applies specifically to extremely low odds.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student states people 'undervalue very small probabilities' but according to prospect theory, merely low probabilities (like 10%) are actually overestimated, not undervalued.
- Incorrect: While the student mentions extremely low odds are undervalued, they don't capture the key insight that extremely low probabilities are often treated as impossibilities rather than just being undervalued.

Score: 0.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Utility refers to the value or benefit of a result. A loss carries a negative utility, which is why people tend to avoid losses.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly identifies that losses carry negative utility, but fails to capture the key concept of loss aversion - that losses are weighted more heavily than equivalent gains. The answer doesn't explain that the utility function is steeper for losses than gains, which is the core principle of loss aversion in prospect theory.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected utility theory includes an additional factor compared to expected value theory, and this factor is subjective.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions that expected utility theory includes an additional subjective factor, but does not specifically identify that expected value theory deals only with financial values while expected utility theory deals with both financial and non-financial values.
- Incorrect: While the student correctly identifies that expected utility theory includes an additional subjective factor, they do not specifically mention risk aversion or the distinction between theories regarding heuristics and biases.

Score: 0.0

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected value theory involves several options, each with various possible outcomes and their associated probabilities. Expected utility theory builds on this by assigning a subjective utility to each outcome. Multi-utility theory expands further by considering that each option has multiple attributes, each with its own weight. Prospect theory also stems from expected utility theory but incorporates heuristics and biases into the evaluation process.

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies expected value theory as involving options with outcomes and probabilities, though doesn't explicitly mention the normrative/financial aspects.
- Correct: Student accurately describes expected utility theory as building on expected value theory with subjective utility assigned to outcomes.
- Incorrect: Student refers to 'Multi-utility theory' instead of 'Multi-attribute utility theory' and doesn't clearly explain that each attribute has both utility and weight.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies prospect theory as stemming from expected utility theory and incorporating heuristics and biases, though doesn't mention it's a descriptive/behavioral model.

Score: 0.75

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Loss aversion means we feel the impact of losing something more strongly than gaining the same amount. Regarding risk aversion, when there's a chance to prevent a loss, we are more likely to take risks.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion can reduce risk aversion by making people more willing to take risks when trying to prevent or avoid losses, which aligns with the key concept that loss aversion can decrease people's tendency to be risk averse.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves understanding that certain events or scenarios are connected, allowing us to anticipate what might occur. Classical conditioning occurs when repeated experiences teach us that specific things are linked or cause one another. Operant conditioning happens when we learn about potential consequences through rewards and punishments.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as learning connections/associations between events, which aligns with the answer key's definition of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as learning through repeated experiences that specific things are linked, which matches the answer key's explanation of learning associations when things happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning about consequences through rewards and punishments, which directly corresponds to the answer key's definition of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation occurs when we mistakenly perceive a cause-and-effect relationship that doesn't actually exist, often confusing it with a mere correlation. Illusory correlation happens when we believe there is a correlation between two things, but in reality, no such connection exists.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly distinguishes between illusory causation (mistakenly perceiving cause-and-effect when only correlation exists) and illusory correlation (perceiving correlation where none actually exists). The answer demonstrates understanding that illusory causation involves misinterpreting existing correlations as causal, while illusory correlation involves perceiving non-existent correlations.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

schema: an understanding of how the Dutch healthcare system operates script: guidelines for appropriate behavior at a birthday party schema: integrating knowledge from various frameworks and perspectives to link ideas script: a specific collection of social norms applied in a given context

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the Dutch healthcare system as a schema and provides an accurate explanation that it involves integrating knowledge and linking ideas, which aligns with schemas being knowledge structures about relationships between concepts.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies birthday party behavior as a script and accurately describes it as social norms applied in a specific context, which matches the definition of scripts as social schemas for situation-specific behavior.

Score: 1.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

Descriptive: explaining why specific stimuli cause particular behaviors.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student identifies behaviorism as 'descriptive' rather than adopting the 'physical stance' as specified in the answer key. While the explanation about stimuli causing behaviors is relevant, it doesn't correctly identify Dennett's physical stance as the level of analysis behaviorists used.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

Intention refers to the purpose behind specific behaviors or psychological processes. Psychologists adopt the intentional stance in this context to understand the reasons why individuals display particular behaviors.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the intentional stance rather than the design stance. While they correctly recognize that evolutionary psychology focuses on purpose/function, they confuse Dennett's intentional stance (which attributes beliefs and desires to explain behavior) with the design stance (which explains phenomena in terms of their functional design for achieving purposes).

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

1. direct/specific: the same variables are involved each time; for example, a cat starts purring when you pet it. 2. consistent: the same result occurs every time; petting a cat always causes it to purr. 3. plausible: the result is reasonable; a cat purring in response to being petted is believable. 4. continuous in time and space: the reaction happens with the same cat being petted, not a different cat elsewhere. 5. effect resembles cause: kicking a ball causes it to move due to your leg's motion.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the distinctness/specificity heuristic with a clear example showing that petting specifically causes purring, demonstrating understanding that the effect follows the specific cause but not other events.
- Correct: The student accurately describes consistency as the same result occurring every time, with an appropriate example showing that petting always causes purring.
- Correct: The student correctly explains plausibility as the result being reasonable/believable, with a fitting example that demonstrates common sense understanding of cause and effect.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of contiguity in time and space, correctly noting that the reaction happens with the same cat being petted rather than a different cat elsewhere.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies similarity between cause and effect, providing a good example of kicking a ball where the motion of the leg resembles the resulting motion of the ball.

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Negativity bias means that negative events affect us more strongly. The availability heuristic is when we judge how likely something is based on how easily we can recall examples. Since negative information sticks with us more, we remember it more clearly. This leads to having more examples in mind, and because of the availability heuristic, we often overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias and explains it as negative events affecting us more strongly, which aligns with the answer key's description of seeking out or placing more weight on negative information like morally outraged content.
- Correct: The student accurately defines the availability heuristic as judging likelihood based on ease of recalling examples, which matches the answer key's definition of estimating frequency based on how easily examples come to mind.
- Correct: The student successfully explains the connection between the two biases: negativity bias makes negative information more memorable, creating more available examples, which through the availability heuristic leads to overestimating moral outrage frequency.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

Contagion is a theoretical framework in biology that explains how diseases spread through contaminated objects. Applying this idea to psychology, one might begin to think that personality traits can also be transferred, such as when someone with negative traits uses an item, leading you to avoid using it yourself.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that biological contagion (disease transmission through contaminated objects) is being inappropriately applied to the psychological/social domain (personality traits being transferred through objects), which matches the answer key's requirement to explain how concepts from the biological domain are incorrectly applied to social/psychological domains.

Score: 1.0

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

Delusions are false beliefs that are not accepted within a culture, while a conspiracy theory is considered delusional if it lacks widespread acceptance.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student only addresses the 'not commonly accepted' criterion but fails to mention that a delusional conspiracy theory must also be an 'irrational belief.' The answer is incomplete as it misses the key requirement of irrationality.

Score: 0.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

1. A propensity to identify patterns within randomness 2. distinction between insiders and outsiders 3. feeling of having control or power

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'propensity to identify patterns within randomness' which matches 'seeing patterns in randomness' from the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student mentions 'distinction between insiders and outsiders' which is not listed among the cognitive and personality factors in the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student mentions 'feeling of having control or power' which is not listed among the cognitive and personality factors in the answer key, though it may relate to narcissism indirectly.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Due to the primacy effect, the initial answer can remain in your mind even after you realize it's incorrect, as it created a stronger impact on you.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the primacy effect as the mechanism. The primacy effect refers to better recall of items at the beginning of a list, not the persistence of incorrect information. The correct mechanisms are source amnesia (forgetting the incorrect source), proactive interference (old incorrect info interfering with new correct info), or the continued-influence effect.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

Challenging the anchor effect: by continuously repeating a statement, our initial beliefs are repeatedly confronted (reflecting the conflict between intuitive and analytical thinking). After enough repetition, this can lead to a change in mindset.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the anchor effect as the mechanism, when the correct answer is mere exposure effect or illusory-truth effect. The anchor effect relates to initial reference points influencing subsequent judgments, not to increased preference or belief through repetition.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

People frequently underestimate the chances of something negative occurring to them. However, individuals with major depressive disorder tend to believe that this likelihood is greater, which may indicate that their assessments are statistically more accurate.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people with major depressive disorder are more accurate at predicting negative events, recognizing that non-depressed people underestimate risks while depressed individuals have more realistic (statistically accurate) assessments of negative outcomes.

Score: 1.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

When sensory information becomes less reliable, it plays a smaller role in shaping perception. As a result, prior beliefs have a greater impact, causing the perception to align more closely with those prior beliefs.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when sensory information becomes less reliable, prior beliefs have a greater impact on perception, and that perception aligns more closely with expectations. This directly matches the answer key's requirement that perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs when sensory reliability decreases.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

Pre-conventional: moral decisions are made based on personal benefit; self-focused. Conventional: considers both oneself and others. Post-conventional: centered on universal principles.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that pre-conventional level focuses on personal benefit and is self-focused, which aligns with the answer key's description of avoiding punishment or gaining rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes conventional level as considering both oneself and others, which matches the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies post-conventional level as centered on universal principles, which aligns with the answer key's description of focus on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model groups causes based on their resulting outcomes. When these causes are clustered together as leading to certain results, we often perceive the outcome as unavoidable, which can lead to hindsight bias.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes a causal model as grouping causes by outcomes rather than as a coherent narrative of how past events are related. This misses the key concept of narrative structure connecting events.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that causal models make outcomes seem unavoidable/inevitable, which contributes to hindsight bias. This captures the essential mechanism.

Score: 0.5

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

When you discover the result of a decision and later reflect on it, you tend to believe it was more probable since the outcome is easier to recall (availability heuristic).

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly attributes hindsight bias to the availability heuristic and ease of recall. The correct explanation is that when estimating past likelihood judgments, people cannot avoid incorporating newly learned information (the actual outcome), which distorts their memory of what they originally thought was likely to happen.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing involves striving to find the absolute best choice, while satisficing means settling for an option that is good enough. Maximizing is frequently linked to neurotic tendencies.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as striving to find the absolute best choice, which aligns with the answer key's definition of 'trying to make the best choice'.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as settling for an option that is good enough, which matches the answer key's definition of 'making a good-enough choice'.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that maximizing is linked to neurotic tendencies, which corresponds to the answer key's point that high neuroticism is associated with the maximizing decision style.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

Assigning homework requires students to interact with the material. When they apply their knowledge to test questions, the availability heuristic helps them recall how to do so. Creating online flashcards is also effective (and it's recommended not to guess if unsure): when students see a definition, they immediately see the correct answer, leveraging the primacy effect.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement by proposing specific, practical solutions (homework assignments, online flashcards) and connecting them to relevant psychological concepts (availability heuristic, primacy effect). The answer shows thoughtful consideration of how to promote active learning within resource constraints, which directly addresses the question's core challenge.
