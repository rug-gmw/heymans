## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

- System 1 forms moral judgments primarily through intuitions. - System 2 can subsequently modify these initial judgments using reasoning, but this occurs only after the fact. - According to Haidt's social-intuitionist model, System 1 plays the leading role.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 forms moral judgments through intuitions, which aligns with the answer key's requirement that System 1 refers to intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student accurately describes System 2's role in reasoning and modifying judgments, which corresponds to the answer key's specification that System 2 refers to reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student correctly states that System 1 plays the leading role in Haidt's model, which matches the answer key's requirement that System 1 thinking is more dominant than System 2 thinking.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

Representativeness heuristic: we judge the probability that A belongs to category B by how closely A resembles a typical example of B.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying mechanism for this assumption.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that the representativeness heuristic involves judging probability of category membership based on resemblance to typical examples, which matches the answer key's explanation about estimating likelihood based on resemblance to stereotypes.

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

- Anchoring describes how initial impressions act as a reference point that can be modified afterward. - The primacy effect highlights how first impressions disproportionately influence our memory and perception. - Both ideas relate to how information is first introduced.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as using initial information as a reference point, which aligns with the answer key's description of taking the first piece of information as a starting point.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as first impressions disproportionately influencing memory and perception, which matches the answer key's emphasis on better remembering first information.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both concepts relate to how information is first introduced, demonstrating understanding of their common overreliance on initial information.

Score: 1.0

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

- Loss aversion refers to the tendency to weigh losses more heavily than equivalent gains. - Conversely, risk aversion describes our overall inclination to choose certainty rather than face uncertainty.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves weighing losses more heavily than equivalent gains, which matches the answer key's definition.
- Correct: The student accurately describes risk aversion as the inclination to choose certainty over uncertainty, which aligns with the answer key's definition of preferring certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 1.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias refers to the tendency to overpredict how much our future emotions will be affected by our choices. As a result, individuals might hesitate to end relationships because they believe the outcomes will be more severe than they actually are.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as overpredicting how much future emotions will be affected by choices, which captures the essence of overestimating the impact of future events on future feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly explains that impact bias prevents breakups because people believe the outcomes will be more severe than they actually are, which aligns with overestimating how bad a breakup will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting is the process of anticipating our future emotions. We tend to exaggerate the impact our choices will have on how we feel later. This concept is especially relevant in end-of-life decisions, as our viewpoint on certain issues may shift dramatically when that time comes.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies affective forecasting as predicting future emotions, which aligns with the answer key's definition of 'predictions about our own future emotional state.'
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding that perspectives change over time, specifically mentioning that 'our viewpoint on certain issues may shift dramatically when that time comes,' which captures the essence of healthy people's preferences potentially changing when they actually become sick.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

- Prospect theory suggests that individuals tend to overvalue small probabilities. - This contrasts with extremely low probabilities, which are generally perceived as impossible.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that prospect theory suggests individuals overvalue (overestimate) small/low probabilities, which aligns with the answer key point about merely low probabilities being overestimated.
- Correct: The student accurately states that extremely low probabilities are perceived as impossible, which directly matches the answer key point about extremely low probabilities being interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion means we tend to perceive losses as more significant than gains. For example, we are likely to steer clear of scenarios involving equal amounts of gains and losses because losses have a greater impact on our sense of value.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that losses are perceived as more significant than gains and have a greater impact on our sense of value, which captures the core concept that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities in prospect theory.

Score: 1.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected utility theory incorporates utilities that are not necessarily financial and can also be subjective. While neither theory perfectly captures human behavior, expected utility theory applies to a wider variety of situations compared to expected value theory.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected utility theory incorporates non-financial utilities and can be subjective, which aligns with the answer key point that expected value theory deals only with financial values while expected utility deals with non-financial values.
- Incorrect: The student mentions that neither theory perfectly captures human behavior and that expected utility applies to wider situations, but fails to address the key distinction about risk aversion or heuristics and biases that differentiates the theories.

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

- Expected value theory describes decision-making by assigning monetary values to different options. - Expected utility theory is similar but allows for utilities that may be subjective and not strictly financial. - Multiple attribute utility theory considers decisions based on various attributes, each given a specific weight and utility. - Behavioral Life-Cycle hypothesis explains spending decisions by how individuals categorize their money, such as current income, assets, or savings.

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies expected value theory as involving monetary values and decision-making between options, which aligns with the answer key's description of financial outcomes and probabilities.
- Correct: Student accurately describes expected utility theory as similar to expected value theory but allowing for subjective, non-financial utilities, which matches the answer key exactly.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies multi-attribute utility theory as considering various attributes with specific weights and utilities, which corresponds to the answer key's description.
- Incorrect: Student describes 'Behavioral Life-Cycle hypothesis' instead of prospect theory. This is a completely different model that deals with mental accounting and spending categorization, not the descriptive model of choice that incorporates heuristics and biases as specified in the answer key.

Score: 0.75

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

- Loss aversion means we place greater importance on avoiding losses than on achieving gains. - When presented with a chance to win, we tend to avoid taking risks. - When we perceive a threat, we are more inclined to take risks.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion leads people to take risks when facing potential losses (when they 'perceive a threat'), which aligns with the key point that loss aversion can decrease risk aversion and make people risk seeking to avoid losses.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

- Conditioning involves acquiring associations by noticing how events occur together. - Classical conditioning means learning that event A is linked to event B by observing their simultaneous occurrence. - Operant conditioning involves acquiring a behavior by means of rewards and consequences.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as learning associations through observing events that occur together, which aligns with the answer key's concept of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as learning links between events through their simultaneous occurrence, which matches the answer key's explanation of associating things that happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as acquiring behavior through rewards and consequences, which corresponds to the answer key's description of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

- Illusory causation involves incorrectly interpreting a relationship between events (which might actually be genuine) as a cause-and-effect connection. - Illusory correlation refers to the erroneous perception that two unrelated events are linked.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that illusory causation involves incorrectly interpreting a relationship as causal (matching the key's point about correlation being incorrectly interpreted as causal) and that illusory correlation involves perceiving a link between unrelated/uncorrelated events. The core distinction between misinterpreting causation vs. perceiving non-existent correlation is captured accurately.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

The Dutch healthcare system illustrates a schema because it represents a body of knowledge that provides context for a particular situation. In contrast, the appropriate behavior at a birthday party exemplifies a script, as it is a social form of schema that differs between cultures.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the Dutch healthcare system as a schema and provides an accurate explanation that it represents organized knowledge that provides context, which aligns with the answer key's definition of schemas as knowledge and relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies birthday party behavior as a script and accurately explains it as a social form of schema that varies culturally, which matches the answer key's description of scripts as social schemas for specific situational behavior.

Score: 1.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

Behaviorists took a physical perspective because they concentrated on the direct outcomes of particular behaviors.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly identifies that behaviorists adopted the physical stance, but their explanation is incomplete and somewhat confused. They mention 'direct outcomes of particular behaviors' rather than focusing on the stimulus-response processes that cause stimuli to result in behaviors, which is the key aspect of the physical stance in this context.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

Evolutionary psychologists take a functional approach because they concentrate on the goals and reasons behind things.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly identifies that evolutionary psychologists take a functional approach, but fails to specifically identify this as the 'design stance' from Dennett's framework, which was explicitly required by the question.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

- Specificity: B occurs only if A occurs  
- Consistency: whenever A occurs, B follows  
- Plausibility: it is physically feasible for B to occur when A does  
- Contiguity in space and time: A and B take place at the same location and time  
- Similarity between cause and effect: A is similar to B

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies specificity (equivalent to distinctness) and explains that B occurs only if A occurs, which captures the essence that B follows A but not other events.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies consistency and explains that B always follows A, which matches the answer key exactly.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies plausibility and explains it as physical feasibility, which aligns with the answer key's concept of common sense plausibility.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies contiguity in space and time and accurately explains that A and B occur at the same location and time.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies similarity between cause and effect and explains that A is similar to B, which matches the answer key's concept of superficial resemblance.

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

- Negativity bias: we are more likely to focus on and prioritize negative information. - Availability heuristic: we judge the probability of an event based on how easily examples of it come to mind. - When we see people expressing moral outrage on social media (even if they are few), the combination of negativity bias and the availability heuristic leads us to overestimate how often this negative behavior actually occurs.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias and provides an accurate definition that captures the tendency to focus on and prioritize negative information.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the availability heuristic and provides an accurate definition explaining how we judge probability based on ease of recall.
- Correct: The student successfully explains how these two biases work together - negativity bias makes us focus on moral outrage content, which then makes examples more available in memory, leading to overestimation through the availability heuristic.

Score: 1.0

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

Prospect theory suggests that our choices are driven by two primary needs: relatedness and coherence. Interacting with someone we dislike disrupts the relatedness need, leading to cognitive dissonance, which is why we tend to avoid such interactions whenever possible.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's answer discusses prospect theory, relatedness, and cognitive dissonance, but completely misses the key concept from the answer key. The correct explanation should focus on how biological contagion concepts (like disease transmission) are incorrectly applied to social/psychological domains when avoiding objects previously owned by disliked people. The student's response doesn't address framework theories or domain-inappropriate application of biological concepts.

Score: 0.0

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

- A non-delusional conspiracy theory may contain elements of truth. - A delusional conspiracy theory is considered false and is not accepted by society.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions that delusional theories are 'not accepted by society' which partially captures the 'not commonly accepted' criterion, but fails to identify the key distinction of 'irrational belief' that separates delusional from non-delusional conspiracy theories. The focus on 'elements of truth' vs 'considered false' misses the core definitional criteria.

Score: 0.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

- limited understanding of how the world operates - identifying as a man - feeling of isolation

Feedback:

- Incorrect: While 'limited understanding of how the world operates' relates to intelligence/analytical thinking, it's too vague and doesn't match the specific factors from the answer key like 'low level of intelligence' or 'low level of analytical thinking'.
- Correct: This directly matches 'being a man' from the answer key as a demographic factor contributing to conspiratorial thinking.
- Incorrect: 'Feeling of isolation' is not mentioned in the answer key. The key factors focus on cognitive biases, personality traits, and demographic characteristics rather than social isolation.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Processes such as belief perseverance or the ongoing impact of misinformation can hinder learning by making it difficult to revise our beliefs to align with accurate information.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies psychological mechanisms that explain how incorrect answers can interfere with learning. 'Belief perseverance' and 'ongoing impact of misinformation' are valid psychological concepts that describe how initial incorrect information can persist and interfere with accepting correct information later, which aligns with the answer key's emphasis on source amnesia, proactive interference, and the continued-influence effect.

Score: 1.0

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

By taking advantage of source amnesia, repeatedly presenting the same message may lead to a mistaken feeling of familiarity and acceptance of that message.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that repetition leads to familiarity and acceptance of messages. While they use the term 'source amnesia' instead of 'mere exposure effect' or 'illusory-truth effect,' they demonstrate understanding of the core psychological mechanism - that repeated exposure increases familiarity and perceived credibility/attractiveness of information.

Score: 1.0

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

No, major depressive disorder can actually lead individuals to be more precise in their predictions, as they tend to avoid being excessively optimistic or pessimistic.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people with major depressive disorder are more accurate (precise) at predictions and correctly explains this is due to reduced excessive optimism, which aligns with the answer key's core points about increased accuracy and reduced overly optimistic tendencies.

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

As sensory information becomes less reliable, prior beliefs have a greater impact on perception.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when sensory information becomes less reliable, prior beliefs have a greater impact on perception, which directly matches the key concept from the answer key.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

- Pre-conventional: driven by personal gain, aiming to evade punishment and obtain rewards. - Conventional: strive to behave properly according to laws and social expectations. - Post-conventional: emphasize broader principles, recognizing that morality can be complex and sometimes contradictory, and prioritize the overall welfare.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the pre-conventional level as being driven by personal gain, avoiding punishment, and obtaining rewards, which matches the answer key's focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as striving to behave according to laws and social expectations, which aligns with the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the post-conventional level as emphasizing broader principles and prioritizing overall welfare, which matches the answer key's focus on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model is a framework we create to understand the factors that cause a particular result. These models contribute to hindsight bias because, after forming them, it becomes difficult to entertain the idea that any outcome besides the one that occurred could have taken place.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies a causal model as a framework for understanding how factors lead to results, which aligns with the answer key's definition of a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that causal models make it difficult to imagine alternative outcomes, which effectively captures how events seem more inevitable than they were, contributing to hindsight bias.

Score: 1.0

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Learning gives us new information that becomes difficult to ignore once we have it (known as the curse of knowledge). This leads to hindsight bias because after knowing the result of an event, we struggle to accurately recall how probable we previously believed it to be.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly explains that learning provides new information that cannot be ignored when estimating past likelihood judgments, and explicitly mentions the curse of knowledge. The answer demonstrates understanding of how this mechanism leads to hindsight bias.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

- The maximizing decision style involves striving to make the optimal choice. - The satisficing decision style involves settling for a decision that is satisfactory or adequate. - Neuroticism is associated with the maximizing decision style.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as striving to make the optimal choice, which aligns with 'trying to make the best choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as settling for a decision that is satisfactory or adequate, which matches 'making a good-enough choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that neuroticism is associated with the maximizing decision style, matching the answer key's requirement.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

One way to handle this is by using multi-attribute utility theory (MAUT), where each attribute represents a different resource that helps you accomplish your teaching objectives, and you would assign a weight and utility value to each of these attributes.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement by proposing a structured approach using multi-attribute utility theory (MAUT) to address the resource allocation problem in teaching. While the answer is brief and could benefit from more specific examples of how MAUT would be applied to student engagement strategies, it shows thoughtful consideration of the constraint optimization problem presented in the question.
