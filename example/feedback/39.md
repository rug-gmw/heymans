## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

System 1 operates quickly and with little effort, relying on heuristics and is highlighted by intuition-based models, making it the predominant system. System 2, in contrast, is slow, deliberate, requires effort, and is emphasized in rationalist models.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 relies on intuition, describing it as 'intuition-based models' which aligns with the answer key's requirement that System 1 refers to intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies System 2 as 'slow, deliberate, requires effort' and associates it with 'rationalist models,' which corresponds to the answer key's requirement that System 2 refers to reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student clearly states that System 1 is 'the predominant system,' which directly satisfies the answer key's requirement that System 1 thinking is more dominant than System 2 thinking.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

The representativeness heuristic means that your colleague's appearance matches your typical mental picture of a fashion model, so you classify them in that same group.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process in this scenario.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that the representativeness heuristic involves matching appearance to a mental stereotype/picture and using that similarity to make category judgments, which captures the essence of estimating likelihood based on resemblance to category stereotypes.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring occurs when you select an initial reference point or belief (anchor) that influences how you interpret new information and potentially adjust your belief accordingly. The primacy effect refers to the tendency to recall the first pieces of information more clearly than those presented afterward, with this initial information acting as the anchor.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as selecting an initial reference point that influences interpretation of new information, which aligns with the answer key's description of taking the first piece of information as a starting point.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as the tendency to recall first pieces of information more clearly than later ones, which matches the answer key's definition of better remembering the first piece of information.
- Correct: The student explicitly states that initial information acts as the anchor in both cases, demonstrating understanding that both phenomena involve overreliance on first information, though they don't use the exact phrase 'overreliance on the first piece of information.'

Score: 1.0

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency for individuals to value losses more significantly than gains, while risk aversion is the preference for certainty rather than facing uncertain outcomes.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves valuing losses more significantly than gains, which matches the answer key's definition of weighing losses more heavily than gains.
- Correct: The student accurately describes risk aversion as the preference for certainty rather than facing uncertain outcomes, which aligns with the answer key's definition of preferring certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 1.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

We tend to exaggerate how much future events will affect our emotions. This often stops people from ending relationships because they fear the anticipated pain they expect to feel.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies impact bias as the tendency to exaggerate how much future events will affect our emotions, which matches the answer key's definition of overestimating the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly explains that impact bias prevents breakups because people fear the anticipated pain, which aligns with the answer key's point about overestimating how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Anticipating how future events will affect your emotions is challenging. People often struggle to accurately predict their future feelings, as illustrated by phenomena like the disability paradox.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that affective forecasting involves predicting future emotional states, though they phrase it as 'anticipating how future events will affect your emotions' rather than using the exact term.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of the key concept by mentioning the disability paradox, which is directly related to how healthy people may inaccurately predict their preferences when facing illness or disability, aligning with the answer key's point about preference changes.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

They tend to undervalue small probabilities and do not distinguish between just low and very low probabilities.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student states that people 'undervalue small probabilities' which contradicts the answer key that merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Incorrect: The student claims people 'do not distinguish between just low and very low probabilities' which contradicts the answer key that shows different treatment - merely low probabilities are overestimated while extremely low ones are treated as impossibilities.

Score: 0.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

We tend to perceive losses as more significant than gains of the same amount, leading us to prefer options that minimize our loss of utility.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that losses are perceived as more significant than equivalent gains, which captures the core concept that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities in prospect theory's value function.

Score: 1.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected utility is subjective and serves a descriptive purpose, while expected value focuses solely on financial aspects and is normative.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value focuses solely on financial aspects, which aligns with the answer key point that expected value theory deals only with financial values while expected utility deals with broader non-financial values.
- Incorrect: The student mentions expected utility being subjective and descriptive versus expected value being normative, but fails to address the key distinction about risk aversion and heuristics/biases that the answer key requires.

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Prospect theory is similar to expected utility theory but is descriptive and includes heuristics and biases. Expected utility theory resembles expected value theory but is not limited to financial decisions and can involve subjective preferences. Expected value theory is a normative model of rational decision-making where each option has various possible financial outcomes with associated probabilities. Multi-attribute theory states that each choice has multiple attributes, each with its own utility and weight.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as a normative model involving financial outcomes with probabilities, matching the key elements from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes expected utility theory as similar to expected value theory but extending beyond financial decisions to include subjective preferences/utility.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies multi-attribute utility theory as involving multiple attributes with their own utilities and weights, though they omit that it's a normative model.
- Correct: The student accurately describes prospect theory as descriptive, similar to expected utility theory, and incorporating heuristics and biases.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Individuals tend to select the option that involves the smallest losses, as they perceive it to be the safest choice. They are more willing to take on risk when the likelihood of losing decreases.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly describes loss aversion as making people choose safer options to minimize losses, which suggests increased risk aversion. The answer key requires understanding that loss aversion actually decreases risk aversion and can make people risk-seeking when trying to avoid losses.

Score: 0.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Learning associations through covariation: Classical conditioning involves using an unconditioned stimulus to elicit a conditioned response, as demonstrated by Pavlov. Operant conditioning involves learning associations through rewards and punishments, as explained by Skinner.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as learning associations through covariation, which matches the answer key definition exactly.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of classical conditioning by referencing Pavlov and the unconditioned stimulus/conditioned response mechanism, which aligns with the concept of learning associations when things happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies operant conditioning as learning associations through rewards and punishments, which matches the answer key's definition of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

People often perceive causation when they observe a correlation, but a correlation alone does not imply a cause-and-effect relationship.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student only addresses the concept of illusory causation (incorrectly interpreting correlation as causation) but fails to define or distinguish illusory correlation (perceiving correlation where none exists). The answer is incomplete as it doesn't explain the difference between the two concepts.

Score: 0.0

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

Knowing how to act at a birthday party is an example of a script, which is a social schema for a familiar scenario. On the other hand, understanding the Dutch healthcare system is a schema that encompasses knowledge, rules of thumb, explanations, and organizational structures.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that understanding the Dutch healthcare system is a schema and provides an accurate explanation that it encompasses knowledge, rules, explanations, and organizational structures, which aligns with the answer key's description of schemas as knowledge and relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that knowing how to act at a birthday party is a script and accurately explains it as a social schema for a familiar scenario, which matches the answer key's description of scripts as social schemas describing behavior in specific situations.

Score: 1.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

The physical stance or level of analysis involves understanding the world based on physical laws, without taking into account mental states or intentions.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: While the student correctly identifies the physical stance and provides an accurate definition, they fail to connect this to behaviorism or explain why behaviorists adopted this stance. The answer key requires explaining that behaviorists focused on stimulus-behavior processes, which the student does not address.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

The intentional stance or level involves understanding the world through moral and social intuitions, encouraging individuals to engage socially and support one another.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the intentional stance instead of the design stance. Additionally, their description of the intentional stance is inaccurate - the intentional stance involves predicting behavior by attributing beliefs and desires, not moral/social intuitions. The student fails to recognize that evolutionary psychology adopts the design stance by analyzing psychological processes in terms of their adaptive functions.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

distinct: Does event B occur solely after event A, or can it also follow a different event? consistent: Does event B reliably occur after event A every time? plausible: Is it reasonable that event B could follow event A? contiguous in time and space: Does event B consistently occur the same way after event A, even when conditions vary? similar in cause and effect: Does event B always result similarly after event A?

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies distinctness and explains it as B occurring solely after A rather than following other events, which matches the answer key's concept of specificity.
- Correct: The student accurately describes consistency as B reliably occurring after A every time, which aligns with the answer key's definition.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies plausibility and explains it as being reasonable that B could follow A, matching the answer key's emphasis on common sense plausibility.
- Incorrect: The student misunderstands contiguity in time and space, describing it as consistency across varying conditions rather than A and B occurring at the same time and location.
- Incorrect: The student misinterprets similarity in cause and effect, describing it as consistent results rather than A and B superficially resembling each other.

Score: 0.6

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Availability heuristic: something seems more common because it is frequently encountered on the internet or social media, but that doesn’t necessarily mean it actually occurs more often. Confirmation bias: if you already feel morally outraged, you tend to seek out information that supports your emotions while ignoring evidence that contradicts them.

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies availability heuristic and provides an accurate explanation of how frequent encounters on social media can lead to overestimating actual frequency of events.
- Incorrect: Student identifies confirmation bias instead of negativity bias. While confirmation bias is related, the answer key specifically requires negativity bias - the tendency to seek out or weight negative information more heavily.
- Incorrect: Student does not explain the connection between the two biases or how they work together to cause overestimation of moral outrage frequency.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

Superstitions are irrational beliefs that do not adhere to the natural laws and are not considered a form of religion.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's answer defines superstitions generally but does not address the specific question about magical contagion or explain it in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge. The answer completely misses the key concept that biological contagion frameworks are being misapplied to social/psychological domains.

Score: 0.0

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A delusional conspiracy is an unreasonable belief that is not recognized by society and, in severe cases, can indicate a mental health condition.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a delusional conspiracy theory involves an unreasonable/irrational belief that is not recognized/accepted by society, which matches the key criteria from the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

Identify order in chaos, ascribe intention where there is none, accept supernatural occurrences, act with confidence, display self-centeredness.

Feedback:

- Correct: The phrase 'identify order in chaos' clearly corresponds to 'seeing patterns in randomness' from the answer key.
- Correct: The phrase 'ascribe intention where there is none' directly matches 'attributing agency where it does not exist' from the answer key.
- Correct: The phrase 'accept supernatural occurrences' aligns with 'believing paranormal phenomena' from the answer key.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Starting with an initial value and then making changes based on additional information.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's answer describes anchoring bias or adjustment heuristics, which are not the psychological mechanisms asked for in the question. The answer key requires discussion of source amnesia (forgetting that an initially provided answer was incorrect), proactive interference, or the continued-influence effect - none of which are addressed in the student's response.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

The availability heuristic involves repeating information so that it becomes the first thing people recall when they hear anything related to him or the topic.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly describes the availability heuristic as involving repetition to make information easily recalled, but does not identify the correct psychological mechanism (mere exposure effect or illusory-truth effect) that politicians use when repeating statements to make them more attractive through familiarity.

Score: 0.0

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

One aspect of the positivity bias involves downplaying the chances of negative events occurring. Individuals with major depressive disorder do not make these predictions less accurately due to having a reduced positivity bias.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people with major depressive disorder are more accurate at predicting negative events because they have a reduced positivity bias (equivalent to reduced optimism bias). This aligns with the answer key's point about reduced tendency to be overly optimistic leading to greater accuracy.

Score: 1.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

You will place too much importance on prior beliefs, which will affect your decision-making and result in skewed predictions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that prior beliefs become more influential when sensory information is unreliable, though they frame it as 'too much importance' and focus on decision-making consequences rather than the basic perceptual mechanism described in the answer key.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

Pre-conventional: centered on personal gain; conventional: centered on the feelings of others; postconventional: centered on universal ethical principles.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that pre-conventional level focuses on personal gain, which aligns with the answer key's description of avoiding punishment or gaining rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes conventional level as centered on feelings of others, which matches the answer key's emphasis on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly describes post-conventional level as centered on universal ethical principles, which aligns with the answer key's focus on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

Events that usually occur simultaneously and are linked by cause and effect. When we evaluate the probability of past occurrences, we consider this and often wonder, "How did I miss this causal relationship?"

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's definition focuses on simultaneous events linked by cause and effect, but misses the key concept that a causal model is a coherent narrative explaining how past events are related.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that causal models contribute to hindsight bias by making us question how we missed obvious relationships, which aligns with the concept that events seem more inevitable in retrospect.

Score: 0.5

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

We believe we can predict outcomes based on past experiences and, as a result, tend to overlook or dismiss crucial types of information.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes overconfidence in prediction based on past experience, but does not address the key mechanism of hindsight bias - that newly learned information (knowledge of outcomes) contaminates our ability to accurately recall or estimate what we knew or believed before learning that information.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing involves selecting the optimal option and is a type of perfectionism linked to regret and neuroticism, while satisficing means choosing an option that is sufficiently good.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies maximizing as selecting the optimal option, which aligns with 'trying to make the best choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly describes satisficing as choosing an option that is sufficiently good, which matches 'making a good-enough choice' from the answer key.
- Incorrect: While the student mentions that maximizing is linked to neuroticism, they do not explicitly state that someone high in neuroticism would adopt the maximizing decision style.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

Moral reasoning occurs when individuals lack clear or conflicting moral intuitions, when they are driven to think rationally, or when they encounter another person's differing moral perspective. To encourage all students to participate actively, presenting a controversial topic that sparks diverse opinions can be effective. This approach may lead to cognitive dissonance, prompting students to engage in the discussion to resolve the discomfort or to persuade others to adopt their own moral viewpoint.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement by connecting course concepts (moral reasoning, cognitive dissonance) to a practical teaching strategy. They provide a thoughtful approach using controversial topics to stimulate discussion and explain the psychological mechanism behind why this would encourage student participation. The answer shows understanding of how moral disagreement can motivate engagement.
