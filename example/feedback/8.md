Grade: 2.0

## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidtâ€™s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

The emotional side corresponds to System 1, while the reasoning side aligns with System 2. In this model, System 1, or the emotional aspect, tends to take precedence.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 corresponds to the emotional side/intuitions in Haidt's model.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 2 corresponds to the reasoning side in Haidt's model.
- Correct: The student correctly states that System 1 (emotional aspect) takes precedence over System 2, indicating understanding of the dominance relationship.

Score: 1.0

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

Availability heuristic. When you see an attractive person, you quickly assume they are a fashion model because that idea is readily available in your mind. In reality, the likelihood of them being a fashion model is much lower than many people might believe.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the availability heuristic instead of the representativeness heuristic. The availability heuristic involves judging probability based on how easily examples come to mind, not on similarity to stereotypes.
- Incorrect: While the student mentions assumptions about attractive people and fashion models, they explain it through availability (ease of recall) rather than representativeness (similarity to stereotypes). The explanation focuses on ideas being 'readily available' rather than resemblance to a typical fashion model.

Score: 0.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring involves planting an idea or opinion in someone's mind, while the primacy effect refers to the tendency to give greater importance to the information received first. Both share the characteristic of becoming firmly fixed in your memory.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes anchoring as 'planting an idea or opinion in someone's mind' which is incorrect. Anchoring is about using the first piece of information as a starting point for judgments, not about planting ideas.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that the primacy effect involves giving greater importance to information received first, which aligns with the tendency to better remember the first piece of information.
- Incorrect: The student states both become 'firmly fixed in memory' but misses the key commonality that both involve overreliance on the first piece of information. The focus on memory fixation is not the primary shared characteristic.

Score: 0.3333333333333333

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the fear of losing something one already possesses, while risk aversion is the fear of failing to obtain what one desires.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes loss aversion as 'fear of losing something one already possesses' which misses the key concept that losses are weighted more heavily than equivalent gains. The definition lacks the comparative aspect that distinguishes loss aversion.
- Incorrect: The student defines risk aversion as 'fear of failing to obtain what one desires' which is incorrect. Risk aversion is about preferring certainty over uncertainty, not about fear of not obtaining desired outcomes.

Score: 0.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

You believe that the outcome of a decision will affect you more than it actually will. For example, a person in an unhappy relationship might avoid ending it because they overestimate the true impact it will have on their life.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as overestimating how much a future outcome will affect you, which matches the key concept of overestimating the impact of future events on future feelings.
- Correct: The student provides a clear example showing how impact bias prevents breakups by explaining that people overestimate the negative impact ending the relationship will have, which aligns with the answer key's point about overestimating how bad a breakup will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves evaluating the advantages and disadvantages of a choice while attempting to predict its results. It plays a crucial role in end-of-life decisions, especially when the individual wishing to end their life is unable to communicate clearly, such as when they are in a coma or severely ill.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student defines affective forecasting as evaluating advantages/disadvantages and predicting results of choices, but this misses the key concept that it specifically refers to predictions about one's own future emotional states.
- Incorrect: The student discusses communication difficulties in end-of-life situations but fails to address the core issue that healthy people may predict preferring death when sick, yet actually prefer to live when they become ill.

Score: 0.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

They tend to overvalue very small probabilities. The distinction lies in the fact that when dealing with extremely low probabilities, their overestimation is even more pronounced.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that low probabilities are overestimated, which aligns with the answer key's point about merely low probabilities being overestimated.
- Incorrect: The student claims extremely low probabilities are overestimated even more, but the answer key states they are often interpreted as impossibilities (underestimated or ignored), not overestimated more.

Score: 0.5

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

It illustrates a more negative outlook, so it isn't very helpful.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's answer does not address the key concept that loss aversion means negative utilities are weighted more heavily than positive utilities, or that the value function is steeper for losses than gains. Instead, it provides a vague statement about 'negative outlook' that doesn't demonstrate understanding of the utility-based definition of loss aversion in prospect theory.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory focuses primarily on the monetary worth and pays less attention to the likelihood of use. In contrast, expected utility theory exhibits significantly lower loss aversion than expected value theory.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions monetary worth vs likelihood of use, which doesn't accurately capture the distinction between financial vs non-financial values. The answer key specifies that expected value theory deals only with financial values while expected utility theory also considers non-financial values.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that expected utility theory exhibits lower loss aversion than expected value theory. This misses the key point that expected value theory doesn't consider heuristics and biases at all, while expected utility theory incorporates risk aversion.

Score: 0.0

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesnâ€™t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Moral judgment framework, ideal observer framework, prospect theory framework, schema theory framework

Feedback:

- Incorrect: Student listed 'Moral judgment framework' instead of Expected Value Theory. This is completely incorrect as moral judgment is not one of the four models of choice, value, and utility discussed.
- Incorrect: Student listed 'ideal observer framework' instead of Expected Utility Theory. This is incorrect as ideal observer theory relates to ethics/moral philosophy, not utility theory for decision making.
- Correct: Student correctly identified Prospect Theory as one of the four models, though they didn't provide the required brief explanation of it being a descriptive/behavioral model.
- Incorrect: Student listed 'schema theory framework' instead of Multi-attribute Utility Theory. Schema theory relates to cognitive psychology and memory, not utility-based decision making models.

Score: 0.25

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease peopleâ€™s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Loss aversion causes individuals to be more cautious because they prefer to avoid losses, leading them to take fewer risks.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that loss aversion makes people more risk averse and cautious. The answer key indicates that loss aversion actually decreases risk aversion and can make people risk-seeking when trying to avoid potential losses.

Score: 0.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Implanting an idea or thought firmly in someone's mind. The distinction between classical and operant conditioning is that operant conditioning involves additional factors that influence learning, such as reinforcing behaviors through repetition of tasks.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student defines conditioning as 'implanting an idea or thought firmly in someone's mind' which is incorrect. Conditioning is about learning associations through covariation, not about implanting ideas.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention classical conditioning as learning associations when two things happen together in time and space. They fail to address classical conditioning at all.
- Incorrect: While the student mentions operant conditioning involves reinforcing behaviors, they miss the key concept that it's about learning that actions cause rewards or punishments. Their explanation is incomplete and vague.

Score: 0.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation is more powerful because it leads you to believe that events occurred as a result of your actions. In contrast, illusory correlation involves mistakenly perceiving a relationship between unrelated messages or minor details.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student does not correctly distinguish between illusory causation and illusory correlation. They describe illusory causation as believing events occurred due to one's actions (which is more like illusion of control) rather than incorrectly interpreting correlation as causation. For illusory correlation, they mention 'unrelated messages or minor details' which doesn't capture the core concept of perceiving correlations that don't actually exist between variables.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to â€˜properlyâ€™ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

The Dutch healthcare system is like a script because it follows specific rules that can be learned and found online. In contrast, the appropriate behavior at a birthday party is a schema since it is based on shared social understanding.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the healthcare system as a script and provides faulty reasoning. The healthcare system is a schema because it represents organized knowledge and relationships between concepts, not a sequence of behaviors.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies birthday party behavior as a schema. While they mention 'shared social understanding,' birthday party behavior is actually a script because it describes specific behavioral sequences for a particular social situation.

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

Please provide the text you want me to rephrase.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student did not provide an answer to the question. They only asked for text to rephrase, which is completely unrelated to the exam question about behaviorism and Dennett's stances.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

They adopt a defensive position. In a hundred years, this position will likely be viewed as aggressive, since it excludes people from groups and encourages isolation.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies evolutionary psychologists as adopting a 'defensive position' rather than the design stance from Dennett's framework. The student also misunderstands the question by discussing social implications rather than explaining which of Dennett's three stances (physical, design, or intentional) evolutionary psychologists use when analyzing psychological processes in terms of their adaptive functions.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

predicting one's future emotional states

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student answer 'predicting one's future emotional states' does not mention distinctness/specificity as a heuristic for judging causation versus correlation.
- Incorrect: The student answer does not mention consistency as a heuristic for determining whether A causes B.
- Incorrect: The student answer does not mention plausibility as a heuristic for causal judgment.
- Incorrect: The student answer does not mention contiguity in time and space as a heuristic for establishing causation.
- Incorrect: The student answer does not mention similarity in cause and effect as a heuristic for causal reasoning.

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Negativity bias and confirmation bias lead you to focus more on negative information rather than positive, reinforcing your existing negative beliefs.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias and explains it as focusing more on negative information, which aligns with the answer key's definition of seeking out or placing more weight on negative information like morally outraged content.
- Incorrect: The student identifies confirmation bias instead of the availability heuristic. While confirmation bias involves reinforcing existing beliefs, the answer key specifically requires the availability heuristic, which relates to estimating frequency based on ease of recall.
- Incorrect: The student does not explain the mechanism by which these biases cause overestimation of moral outrage. The answer key requires explaining how negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through availability heuristic leads to overestimation.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

When a person you strongly dislike shares their opinion or provides information, you are likely to distrust what they say, reject their viewpoint, and support the opposing perspective.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes a general social bias or motivated reasoning but does not address the specific concept of magical contagion or explain it in terms of framework theories. The answer does not mention biological contagion concepts being misapplied to social domains, which is the key theoretical explanation requested.

Score: 0.0

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

Regardless of scientific validation, delusional conspiracy theories have been definitively debunked.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's answer focuses only on whether conspiracy theories have been debunked, but completely misses the key distinction from the answer key: that delusional conspiracy theories are characterized by being both irrational beliefs AND not commonly accepted. The answer does not address the rationality or acceptance criteria that define the distinction.

Score: 0.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

Narcissistic traits, lower economic status, and susceptibility to deception.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identified narcissistic traits as a factor contributing to conspiratorial thinking, which matches 'being narcissistic' from the answer key.
- Incorrect: Lower economic status is not mentioned in the answer key as one of the cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking.
- Incorrect: Susceptibility to deception is not specifically listed in the answer key, though it could be related to some factors, it doesn't directly match any of the specified cognitive and personality factors.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you donâ€™t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

The process known as distortion

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's answer 'distortion' is too vague and does not specifically identify the psychological mechanism. The answer key requires identification of source amnesia (forgetting that an incorrect answer was wrong), proactive interference (initial incorrect answers interfering with correct ones), or the continued-influence effect. 'Distortion' is a general term that doesn't capture the specific mechanism by which incorrect quiz answers interfere with learning.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

Anchoring effect

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student answered 'anchoring effect' which refers to the tendency to rely heavily on the first piece of information encountered. This is incorrect - the question asks about making messages more attractive through repetition, which is explained by mere exposure effect or illusory-truth effect, not anchoring.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Yes, major depressive disorder reduces the accuracy with which individuals make these types of predictions.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that major depressive disorder reduces accuracy, when the answer key indicates that people with major depressive disorder are actually more accurate at making predictions about negative events due to reduced optimistic bias.

Score: 0.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

your previous beliefs will have an increasing impact.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that prior beliefs have an increasing impact when sensory information reliability decreases, which directly matches the key concept from the answer key.

According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You donâ€™t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other peopleâ€™s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

Ideal-observer model. Given the information provided, the problem appeared much simpler to solve.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions 'ideal-observer model' which is not the same as a causal model. A causal model is specifically a coherent narrative of how past events are related, not an ideal-observer model.
- Incorrect: While the student mentions that problems appear simpler in hindsight, they don't explain how this relates to causal models making events seem more inevitable, which is the key mechanism of hindsight bias.

Score: 0.0

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Acquiring new knowledge or personal growth helps you better understand your previous actions, making them easier to explain as your understanding increases.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes general retrospective understanding but misses the key mechanism of hindsight bias: that newly learned information cannot be avoided when estimating past likelihood judgments, making outcomes seem more predictable than they actually were at the time.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing decision styles involve greater risks but can lead to larger rewards, while satisficing decision styles are safer and tend to result in more modest outcomes. Individuals with high levels of neuroticism are more likely to use the satisficing approach.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly describes maximizing as involving greater risks for larger rewards rather than trying to make the best choice among available options.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly describes satisficing as safer with modest outcomes rather than making a good-enough choice that meets acceptable criteria.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that high neuroticism individuals use satisficing, when research shows they are more likely to adopt maximizing due to their tendency toward anxiety and perfectionism.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

I would apply affective forecasting to determine the most effective method for increasing student engagement with the material. Additionally, in the initial lecture, I would emphasize the significance of maintaining active involvement with the content.

Feedback:

- Correct: The answer demonstrates serious engagement with the question by proposing a specific psychological concept (affective forecasting) as a solution and recognizing the importance of setting expectations early in the course. While brief, it shows thoughtful consideration of how to approach student engagement within resource constraints.
