Grade: 8.5

## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

According to this model, System 1 influences your viewpoint on an issue through instinctive moral feelings and emotions, while System 2 merely provides retrospective rationalizations by generating moral arguments. Therefore, System 1 is considered the more dominant system.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 involves 'instinctive moral feelings and emotions,' which aligns with the answer key's requirement to identify System 1 as intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student correctly describes System 2 as providing 'retrospective rationalizations by generating moral arguments,' which corresponds to the answer key's description of System 2 as reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student explicitly states 'System 1 is considered the more dominant system,' directly matching the answer key's requirement that System 1 is more dominant than System 2.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

The representative heuristic explains this assumption by suggesting that you classify individuals into the group they most closely resemble.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process, though with a minor spelling variation ('representative' instead of 'representativeness').
- Correct: The student accurately explains that the heuristic involves classifying individuals based on resemblance to a group, which captures the core concept of estimating likelihood based on stereotypical similarity.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring suggests that the initial piece of information about a subject acts as a reference point, which can be modified by later information. However, this original anchor tends to have a greater impact on your viewpoint because it holds more weight than the changes made afterward. This concept is akin to primacy, which holds that the first impression creates the most lasting memory and therefore has the greatest effect on your opinion.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as using initial information as a reference point and acknowledges its disproportionate influence, which aligns with the concept of taking the first piece of information as the starting point.
- Correct: The student accurately describes primacy as creating the most lasting memory from first impressions, which corresponds to the tendency to better remember the first piece of information.
- Correct: The student clearly establishes the connection between anchoring and primacy by explaining that both involve the first piece of information having greater impact or weight, demonstrating understanding of their common overreliance on initial information.

Score: 1.0

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Risk aversion means that individuals prefer to steer clear of risk whenever they can. Loss aversion means that people dislike taking risks that might result in a loss; for instance, when potential gains and losses are equal, people tend to opt for a sure outcome to avoid any loss.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student conflates loss aversion with risk aversion. Loss aversion specifically refers to weighing losses more heavily than equivalent gains, not about avoiding risks that might result in losses.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that risk aversion involves preferring to avoid risk and uncertainty, which aligns with the preference for certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 0.5

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias refers to the tendency of individuals to exaggerate the intensity of their emotional reactions to future events. As a result, people may hesitate to end an unhappy relationship, fearing that the sadness they will feel afterward will be more intense than it actually is.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as the tendency to exaggerate emotional reactions to future events, which captures the essence of overestimating the impact of future events on feelings.
- Correct: The student accurately explains how impact bias prevents breakups by describing how people fear the sadness will be more intense than it actually would be, which aligns with overestimating how bad a breakup will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves anticipating how you will feel in the future, but it is often influenced by various biases, causing individuals to inaccurately predict their future emotional states. This is especially important in end-of-life choices, as people may express a desire to end their life based on their current physical or mental condition, yet when they actually experience that state, they might no longer wish to do so.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines affective forecasting as anticipating/predicting future emotional states, which matches the answer key's definition of 'predictions about our own future emotional state.'
- Correct: The student accurately explains the key concept that people may express a desire to end their life based on current conditions, but when actually experiencing that state, they might not wish to do so, which aligns with the answer key's point about healthy people predicting they'd prefer to die when sick, but not actually preferring to die when they become sick.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

Prospect theory suggests that individuals often undervalue small probabilities (such as 10%), and they tend to ignore extremely small probabilities (like 0.01%) altogether.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student states that people 'undervalue' low probabilities like 10%, but the answer key indicates that merely low probabilities are often overestimated, not underestimated.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that extremely low probabilities (0.01%) are 'ignored altogether,' which aligns with the answer key's point that they are interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 0.5

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Prospect theory suggests that individuals experience negative value from losses. Yet, because of loss aversion, they perceive losses as more detrimental than a purely rational evaluation would indicate.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion means losses are perceived as more detrimental than gains of equivalent magnitude, which reflects that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities in prospect theory.

Score: 1.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

1: Expected value theory focuses on choosing an option based on its monetary value, whereas expected utility theory focuses on choosing based on the overall satisfaction or usefulness of each option. 2: Expected value theory is applicable solely to financial choices, while expected utility theory applies to a wider range of decision-making situations.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory deals with monetary/financial values while expected utility theory considers broader aspects like satisfaction and usefulness, which aligns with the answer key's distinction between financial and non-financial values.
- Incorrect: The student discusses the scope of application (financial vs. broader decisions) but misses the key point about risk aversion and heuristics/biases, which is the second main theoretical difference according to the answer key.

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

The four models are as follows: Expected value theory seeks to assign a monetary value to each option to identify the most financially advantageous choice. Expected utility theory assigns a utility value to each option to determine the best choice based on overall utility. Multi-attribute utility theory (MAUT) also assigns utility values like expected utility theory, but it considers multiple weighted attributes for each option. Prospect theory resembles expected utility theory but incorporates heuristics and cognitive biases in the evaluation process.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as assigning monetary values to options for financial decision-making, which aligns with the answer key's description of financial outcomes with probabilities.
- Correct: The student accurately describes expected utility theory as assigning utility values (beyond just financial) to determine the best choice, matching the answer key's explanation of subjective utility outcomes.
- Correct: The student correctly explains MAUT as considering multiple weighted attributes with utility values, which matches the answer key's description of multiple attributes each having utility and weight.
- Correct: The student accurately describes prospect theory as similar to expected utility theory but incorporating heuristics and cognitive biases, which aligns with the answer key's description of it being a descriptive behavioral model with heuristics and biases.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

When individuals experience loss aversion, they tend to take greater risks (become less risk-averse) to prevent losses. This behavior is frequently observed in political contexts, especially among populist groups.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion leads people to take greater risks (become less risk-averse) to prevent losses, which directly aligns with the answer key's point that people are willing to accept risk to avoid potential losses and that loss aversion decreases risk aversion.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves acquiring a connection by recognizing a correlation. In classical conditioning, you form a link between two related events, whereas in operant conditioning, you learn the relationship between a behavior and its following reward or penalty.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as learning associations/connections through correlation, which aligns with the answer key's definition of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as forming links between two related events, which matches the answer key's explanation of learning to associate things that happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning the relationship between behavior and its consequences (reward or penalty), which aligns with the answer key's definition of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory correlation refers to the tendency of individuals to perceive a relationship between variables when no such relationship actually exists. Illusory causation, on the other hand, occurs when people interpret a correlation as a cause-and-effect connection, even though no true causation is present. Therefore, illusory causation involves a real correlation without causation, while illusory correlation involves no genuine correlation at all.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly distinguishes that illusory correlation is perceiving a relationship between variables when none exists, and illusory causation is interpreting correlation as causation when no true causal relationship is present. The explanation accurately captures the key difference outlined in the answer key.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

Knowing how the Dutch healthcare system operates is an example of a schema, while knowing the appropriate behavior at a birthday party is an example of a script. This is because a script outlines typical social interactions with specific guidelines, making a birthday party a clearer example of a script than the healthcare system.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that understanding the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, though they don't explicitly mention it relates to knowledge and relationships between things as specified in the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that knowing appropriate behavior at a birthday party is a script and provides adequate reasoning about social interactions and specific guidelines, which aligns with the answer key's explanation about social schemas for specific situations.

Score: 1.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

Behaviorists took a mechanical approach, focusing on figuring out how a specific system functions, similar to their attempt to comprehend how stimuli provoke certain behaviors.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes a 'mechanical approach' which sounds more like the design stance (understanding how a system functions for its purpose) rather than the physical stance. The physical stance focuses on the underlying physical processes and causal mechanisms, not on functional understanding of how systems work.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

Evolutionary psychologists take a design perspective, aiming to understand why something exists in its current form, much like examining the reasons behind the nature of psychological processes.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance and provides an appropriate explanation that they aim to understand 'why something exists in its current form' and examine 'the reasons behind the nature of psychological processes,' which aligns with the functional perspective described in the answer key.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

The five heuristics are: Distinct, meaning only A is linked to B and not, for instance, C; Consistent, where A reliably correlates with B; Plausible, indicating it’s reasonable that A could cause B; Contagious in space and time, meaning A and B occur together in the same location and at the same time; and Similar in cause and effect, where A and B exhibit comparable patterns or behaviors.

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies distinctness/specificity and explains that only A is linked to B, not other events like C.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies consistency and explains that A reliably correlates with B, capturing the essence of the heuristic.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies plausibility and explains it as being reasonable that A could cause B, matching the answer key.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies contiguity in time and space (using 'contagious' as a synonym) and accurately explains co-occurrence in location and time.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies similarity in cause and effect and explains it as A and B exhibiting comparable patterns/behaviors, which aligns with superficial resemblance.

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

This is mainly due to the availability heuristic and negativity bias. Negativity bias drives individuals to focus on negative content on social media, and then the availability heuristic leads us to assume that many people are morally outraged.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias and explains that it causes people to focus on negative content, which aligns with the answer key's description of seeking out or placing more weight on negative information like morally outraged content.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the availability heuristic and explains that it leads us to assume many people are morally outraged, which matches the answer key's description of estimating frequency based on ease of recall.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of how these biases work together - negativity bias causes focus on negative content, which then feeds into availability heuristic leading to overestimation, matching the causal relationship described in the answer key.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

From biological understanding, viruses are known to be infectious. Similarly, viruses evoke negative feelings, much like an individual you dislike. This can create the impression that the person's negative energy is contagious, causing you to avoid using their belongings.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that biological contagion concepts (viruses being infectious) are being applied to the social/psychological domain (avoiding belongings of disliked people due to perceived 'negative energy' transmission), demonstrating understanding of cross-domain framework theory application.

Score: 1.0

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A delusional conspiracy theory is one that is generally rejected by a society, whereas a non-delusional conspiracy theory is widely accepted as true within that society.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student only addresses the social acceptance criterion but misses the crucial element that a delusional conspiracy theory must also be an irrational belief. The answer key requires both conditions: being irrational AND not commonly accepted.

Score: 0.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

Conspiratorial thinking is influenced by narcissism, a belief in paranormal phenomena, and a sense of alienation.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identified narcissism as a personality factor contributing to conspiratorial thinking, which matches the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identified belief in paranormal phenomena as a cognitive factor contributing to conspiratorial thinking, which is listed in the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student mentioned 'sense of alienation' which is not included in the provided answer key factors for conspiratorial thinking.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Anchoring and adjustment refers to the way an initial impression on a subject serves as a reference point. In this scenario, your initial incorrect response acts as that reference, which is then modified afterward. However, the original anchor tends to be remembered more strongly, which can hinder the learning process.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes anchoring and adjustment, which is a judgment and decision-making heuristic, not the correct psychological mechanism. The answer key requires source amnesia (forgetting the source of information and mistaking incorrect answers for correct ones), proactive interference (old incorrect information interfering with new correct information), or the continued-influence effect. Anchoring and adjustment does not explain how incorrect answers interfere with learning in this context.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

Politicians rely on the mere exposure effect, which suggests that individuals tend to develop a favorable attitude toward a politician's message when they encounter it frequently.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the mere exposure effect as the psychological mechanism and accurately explains that repeated exposure leads to more favorable attitudes toward the message, which matches the answer key's explanation of mere exposure as the tendency to prefer familiar things.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Individuals with major depressive disorder lack a positivity bias. In contrast, healthy individuals with this bias tend to be unrealistically optimistic, believing they are less likely to experience negative events. Therefore, those with major depressive disorder tend to make more realistic predictions in such situations.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people with major depressive disorder are more accurate at predictions due to lacking the positivity bias that makes healthy individuals unrealistically optimistic about negative events, which aligns with the answer key's point about reduced overly optimistic tendencies leading to greater accuracy.

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

As sensory information becomes less reliable, prior beliefs have a stronger impact.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when sensory information becomes less reliable, prior beliefs have a stronger/increased impact on perception, which directly matches the key concept from the answer key.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

The initial level is the pre-conditional stage, where children reason based on rewards and punishments, resulting in self-centered behavior. The second level, called the conditional stage, involves individuals whose actions are influenced by others' opinions and rules, reflecting a social orientation. The final level is the post-conditional stage, where individuals recognize that values can sometimes be in conflict and prioritize moral principles.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the pre-conventional level as reasoning based on rewards and punishments, though they use 'pre-conditional' instead of 'pre-conventional' - the description matches the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as being influenced by others' opinions and rules with social orientation, despite calling it 'conditional' rather than 'conventional'.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the post-conventional level as prioritizing moral principles and recognizing conflicting values, though they use 'post-conditional' instead of 'post-conventional'.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

Following an event, you develop a causal explanation for how and why it took place. When reflecting on the event's predictability, it appears highly foreseeable in retrospect because you instinctively refer to the causal model, making each step leading to the event seem logical and inevitable.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a causal model is a causal explanation developed after an event that explains how and why it occurred, which aligns with the answer key's definition of a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student accurately explains how causal models contribute to hindsight bias by making events appear highly foreseeable and inevitable in retrospect, which matches the answer key's point about events seeming more inevitable than they actually were.

Score: 1.0

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

After an event has occurred, you have had the chance to learn from it. This makes the event seem understandable in retrospect. Therefore, learning leads to hindsight bias because the outcome appears obvious after the fact.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes how learning makes events seem obvious in retrospect, but fails to address the key mechanism: that when estimating past likelihood judgments, newly learned information cannot be avoided and contamines those estimates. The answer misses the core point about how learning interferes with accurately recalling or estimating what we previously thought.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

A person with a maximizing decision style aims to select the option that offers the greatest benefit in each situation. In contrast, someone with a satisficing decision style seeks choices that are adequate rather than optimal. Individuals who score highly in neuroticism are more inclined to use the maximizing approach when making decisions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as aiming to select the option that offers the greatest benefit, which aligns with 'trying to make the best choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as seeking choices that are adequate rather than optimal, which matches 'making a good-enough choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that individuals high in neuroticism are more inclined to use the maximizing approach, which matches the answer key's statement about adopting the maximizing decision style.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

In other departments, professors often receive assistance from master’s students or senior bachelor’s students. Typically, these individuals help grade tutorial exercises and assignments, but they might also be able to assist with exam grading. That said, I’m not sure if this is allowed, and the system might be vulnerable to fraud. Another possibility is to make the exam multiple-choice. Since the questions and answers are fairly straightforward, I don’t think much is lost by using a multiple-choice format. To maintain engagement with the content, the assignment could be expanded—for example, by organizing a meeting after the peer review where both groups can share their feedback under the guidance of Mr. Mathot.

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement with the question by proposing multiple practical solutions: using teaching assistants for grading support, implementing multiple-choice exams to reduce grading burden, and expanding assignments with structured peer feedback sessions. The answer shows thoughtful consideration of resource constraints while addressing student engagement, and even acknowledges potential limitations (fraud vulnerability). This reflects genuine effort to balance practical constraints with pedagogical goals.

Score: 1.0
