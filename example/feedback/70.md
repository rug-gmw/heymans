Grade: 9.0

## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

In this model, System 1, which operates quickly and with little effort using biases and heuristics, is the primary influence. Moral judgments are mainly shaped by System 1 processes, such as emotions and intuition, with only a small role played by reasoning in the formation of moral judgments.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 involves intuitions and emotions, mentioning that moral judgments are 'mainly shaped by System 1 processes, such as emotions and intuition.'
- Correct: The student correctly identifies System 2 as reasoning, stating that 'only a small role played by reasoning in the formation of moral judgments,' which implies System 2 is the reasoning component.
- Correct: The student clearly states that System 1 is dominant, saying it 'is the primary influence' and that moral judgments are 'mainly shaped by System 1 processes' with reasoning playing only 'a small role.'

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

Representativeness heuristic refers to estimating the probability that something belongs to a specific category based on how closely it resembles the typical characteristics of that category.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process in this scenario.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that the representativeness heuristic involves estimating probability of category membership based on resemblance to typical characteristics, which captures the essence of comparing someone to a stereotype.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring occurs when the first piece of information disproportionately impacts our judgments and decisions. Even when new evidence is introduced, our subsequent evaluations are heavily shaped by this initial anchor, as adjustments made are usually inadequate, making the anchor fairly persistent. The primacy effect refers to the strong influence of initial information, especially important in shaping impressions and memories. Both concepts involve a significant impact from early information.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as the tendency to rely heavily on the first piece of information, describing how it disproportionately impacts judgments and decisions, which aligns with the answer key's definition of taking the first piece of information as the starting point.
- Incorrect: While the student mentions that the primacy effect involves the strong influence of initial information on impressions and memories, they don't specifically identify it as the tendency to better remember the first piece of information, which is the key distinction in the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both concepts involve a significant impact from early/initial information, which captures the essence of overreliance on the first piece of information as stated in the answer key.

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency to be more affected by losses than by equivalent gains, with losses evoking stronger emotional responses. On the other hand, risk aversion describes a preference for certainty rather than uncertain outcomes.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves being more affected by losses than equivalent gains, which matches the answer key's definition of weighing losses more heavily than gains.
- Correct: The student accurately describes risk aversion as a preference for certainty rather than uncertain outcomes, which aligns with the answer key's definition of preferring certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 1.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias involves overestimating how strongly we will feel emotions in the future. This can lead individuals to avoid ending relationships, as they might mistakenly believe that a breakup will be extremely painful, despite being unhappy in the relationship.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as overestimating how strongly we will feel emotions in the future, which aligns with the answer key's definition of overestimating the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Correct: The student accurately explains how impact bias prevents breakups by describing that people avoid ending relationships because they mistakenly believe breakups will be extremely painful, which matches the answer key's point about overestimating how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves anticipating our future emotions based on choices we face and make now. It is especially relevant for end-of-life decisions, as individuals might experience emotions differently when seriously ill compared to when they are healthy.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies affective forecasting as predicting future emotions, which aligns with the answer key's definition of 'predictions about our own future emotional state.'
- Correct: The student recognizes that emotions may differ between healthy and ill states in end-of-life contexts, which captures the essence of the answer key's point about healthy people's predictions potentially changing when actually sick.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

Prospect theory suggests that individuals tend to overvalue low probabilities. Yet, probabilities that are extremely low are perceived as impossible. Therefore, there is indeed a distinction in how low and extremely low probabilities are evaluated.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly states that individuals tend to overvalue low probabilities, which aligns with the answer key point that merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Correct: The student accurately identifies that extremely low probabilities are perceived as impossible, which matches the answer key point about extremely low probabilities being interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

The theory suggests that we are emotionally more affected by losses than by gains of the same amount.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion means losses have greater impact than equivalent gains, which directly corresponds to the concept that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities in prospect theory.

Score: 1.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

1) Expected value theory focuses solely on financial and monetary results, whereas expected utility theory goes beyond that by incorporating personal preferences (utility). 2) Furthermore, expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory focuses on financial/monetary results while expected utility theory incorporates personal preferences (utility), which aligns with the answer key's distinction between financial vs non-financial values.
- Correct: The student correctly mentions that expected utility theory considers risk aversion, which matches the second point in the answer key about expected utility theory accounting for risk aversion while expected value theory does not consider heuristics and biases.

Score: 1.0

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected value theorem (normative): This theory applies strictly to financial outcomes when calculating probabilities and monetary values. Expected utility theory (normative): Unlike the previous theory, this one incorporates individuals’ desires and preferences. It uses probabilities and subjective utilities in its calculations and accounts for risk aversion. Multi-attribute utility theory: Similar in concept to expected utility theory, it follows the same calculation method but considers multiple attributes for each option, assigning weights instead of probabilities to these attributes. Prospect Theory (descriptive): This is a modified form of the expected utility theorem that includes heuristics and biases affecting how people assess probabilities and utilities, reflecting actual human judgment.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as normative and mentions it deals with financial outcomes and probabilities, which aligns with the key concept of choosing between options with financial outcomes and probabilities.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected utility theory as normative, mentions it uses probabilities and subjective utilities (not just financial), and notes it accounts for individual preferences and risk aversion, which captures the essence of utility being subjective rather than purely financial.
- Correct: The student correctly describes multi-attribute utility theory as having multiple attributes with weights, though they don't explicitly mention it's normative. The core concept of multiple attributes each having utility and weight is correctly captured.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies prospect theory as descriptive and mentions it includes heuristics and biases that affect probability and utility assessment, which aligns with it being a behavioral model that considers cognitive biases.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

This relates to the way situations are presented. When individuals perceive that they stand to lose something, they tend to take greater risks to try to minimize or prevent that loss. Conversely, if they believe nothing is at risk, they are more likely to avoid risks in order to protect what they currently possess.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion can make people more risk-seeking when they perceive potential losses, which directly addresses how loss aversion decreases risk aversion. The answer also demonstrates understanding of the framing effect by contrasting behavior when losses are perceived versus when they are not.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning is a learning method based on the relationship between events. Classical (associative) conditioning involves forming a connection between two events that happen simultaneously, allowing us to associate them. Operant conditioning involves learning from the consequences of our behavior, whether they are rewards or punishments.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as a learning method based on relationships between events, which aligns with the answer key's definition of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as forming connections between two events that happen simultaneously and learning to associate them, which matches the answer key's explanation of learning associations when things happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning from behavioral consequences (rewards or punishments), which directly corresponds to the answer key's definition of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory correlation refers to perceiving a relationship between two variables when none actually exists. In contrast, illusory causality involves assuming a cause-and-effect connection based on a real correlation, but mistakenly interpreting it as causation.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly distinguishes that illusory correlation involves perceiving a relationship between variables when none exists, while illusory causation involves incorrectly interpreting an existing correlation as a causal relationship. The explanation accurately captures the key difference between these two concepts.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

The Dutch healthcare system operates like a schema. A script refers to a scenario where individuals are questioned about the appropriate behavior at a birthday party. This script represents a culturally and socially specific schema for typical situations.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, though the explanation is minimal compared to the answer key which specifies it involves knowledge and relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script and provides a reasonable explanation that it represents a culturally and socially specific schema for typical situations, which aligns with the answer key's description of social schemas for specific situations.

Score: 1.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

Behaviorists took a physical (mechanical) approach, concentrating on how a specific stimulus leads to a particular behavior, which can be directly observed. They did not consider the underlying reasons or intentions, focusing solely on the physical connection between stimulus and behavior.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that behaviorists adopted the physical stance and provides accurate reasoning - they focused on observable stimulus-response connections without considering internal mental processes or intentions, which aligns with the physical stance's emphasis on mechanical causation.

Score: 1.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

The intentional stance should be used as it offers the greatest understanding of the fundamental causes and motivations behind behavior from an evolutionary perspective.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the intentional stance instead of the design stance. While they correctly recognize that evolutionary psychology focuses on understanding behavior from an evolutionary perspective, they misunderstand Dennett's levels of analysis. The design stance is appropriate because evolutionary psychologists examine psychological processes in terms of their adaptive function and evolutionary purpose, not in terms of beliefs and desires (which would be the intentional stance).

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Distinctiveness (specificity): B happens because of A, and no other factor causes B. Consistency: Whenever A occurs, B always follows; B never happens without A being present. Plausibility: It makes logical sense that A leads to B. Contiguity in time or space: After A causes B, they occur close together in time or location. Similarity in cause and effect: A and B occur within the same context, making it easy to understand their connection. For example, kicking a football: the movement of your leg directly causes the ball to move in a specific way.

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies distinctiveness/specificity and explains that B follows A but not other events, matching the answer key concept.
- Incorrect: Student states 'B never happens without A being present' which is too strong - the answer key only requires that B always follows A, not that A is necessary for B.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies plausibility and explains it makes logical sense that A leads to B, which aligns with the answer key's 'common sense' explanation.
- Incorrect: Student incorrectly describes temporal sequence ('After A causes B') rather than simultaneity - the answer key specifies A and B occur 'at the same time' and location.
- Incorrect: Student describes contextual connection rather than superficial resemblance - the answer key specifies that A and B should 'superficially resemble each other'.

Score: 0.4

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Negativity bias refers to our tendency to be heavily influenced by and attracted to negative information and emotions. Availability bias means we assess the probability of an event based on how easily it can be recalled, with accessibility playing a crucial role. Since we focus on negative content and its related emotions, these become more noticeable and easier to remember, leading us to perceive society as more morally upset.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias and explains it as the tendency to be influenced by and attracted to negative information, which aligns with the answer key's description of seeking out or placing more weight on negative information like morally outraged content.
- Correct: The student accurately describes availability bias (heuristic) as assessing probability based on how easily something can be recalled, with accessibility being crucial. This matches the answer key's definition of estimating frequency based on ease of recall.
- Correct: The student successfully explains the connection between the two biases: negativity bias makes negative content more noticeable and memorable, which through availability bias leads to overestimating moral outrage in society. This demonstrates understanding of how the biases work together as described in the answer key.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

We might have a strong aversion to using secondhand items, fearing that they could carry negative energy or germs from the former owner. This reaction can be understood as applying our biological understanding too broadly to different areas. (Our biological knowledge serves as a general guiding framework that helps us make sense of the world effectively.)

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that biological concepts of contagion (mentioning germs and contamination) are being inappropriately applied to social/psychological domains (negative energy, aversion to items from disliked people). They explicitly state this is 'applying our biological understanding too broadly to different areas,' which directly matches the answer key's requirement about incorrectly applying biological domain concepts to other domains.

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

Few people believe in delusional conspiracies, and they are generally not very convincing.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions that few people believe in delusional conspiracies (touching on the 'not commonly accepted' aspect) but fails to address the key distinction that delusional conspiracy theories must be both irrational beliefs AND not commonly accepted. The student does not mention irrationality at all, which is a crucial component of the definition.

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

A tendency to look for simple explanations within complicated matters, hold superstitious beliefs, and distrust science, often influenced by popular narratives.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student mentions 'look for simple explanations within complicated matters' which directly corresponds to 'believing in simple explanations for complex events' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student mentions 'hold superstitious beliefs' which aligns with 'believing paranormal phenomena' from the answer key, as superstitious beliefs are closely related to paranormal beliefs.
- Incorrect: While the student mentions 'distrust science' and 'influenced by popular narratives,' these do not clearly match any of the specific cognitive and personality factors listed in the answer key.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

By way of confirmation bias.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student answered 'confirmation bias' which is incorrect. The answer key specifies source amnesia as the main mechanism - where you forget that your initial answer was wrong and mistake it for the correct answer. Confirmation bias refers to seeking information that confirms existing beliefs, which doesn't explain how incorrect quiz answers interfere with learning the correct information.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

The phenomenon where people tend to develop a preference for things simply because they are familiar with them.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the core concept of mere exposure effect - that familiarity breeds preference. While they don't use the specific term 'mere exposure' or mention the alternative 'illusory-truth effect,' they accurately describe the psychological mechanism by which repeated exposure leads to increased preference.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

People with depression often lack a positivity bias, meaning they do not have overly favorable views of themselves or underestimate the likelihood of negative events occurring. As a result, they tend to make more accurate predictions about the chances of bad things happening to them.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people with depression lack positivity bias and do not underestimate negative events, leading to more accurate predictions. This aligns with the answer key's point about reduced overly optimistic tendencies making depressed individuals more accurate at such predictions.

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

As sensory information becomes less reliable, beliefs play a larger and more influential role in perception, causing what is perceived to closely reflect those beliefs.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when sensory information becomes less reliable, prior beliefs have a larger and more influential role in perception, which directly matches the key concept that perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs when sensory reliability decreases.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

Pre-conventional: Actions are driven by a desire to gain rewards and avoid consequences, without considering social rules or norms. It focuses on self-interest with minimal regard for mutual exchange. Conventional: Social rules and norms are recognized, and the feelings of others, as well as their opinions of us, hold significance. Post-conventional: While recognizing that moral judgments can sometimes conflict, the focus is placed on universal ethical principles.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the pre-conventional level as focusing on gaining rewards and avoiding consequences (punishment), which matches the answer key's emphasis on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as recognizing social rules and norms and considering others' feelings and opinions, which aligns with the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the post-conventional level as focusing on universal ethical principles, which corresponds to the answer key's description of focusing on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model of past events involves understanding a previous event by constructing explanations that link causes to what happened, incorporating reasoning. This process leads to hindsight bias because after an event takes place and its outcome is known, we tend to believe that the outcome was more predictable and obvious from the beginning. In other words, knowing the result and its causes prompts us to create causal narratives in our minds, fostering the feeling that we "knew it all along."

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a causal model involves constructing explanations that link causes to what happened, which aligns with the answer key's definition of a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student accurately explains how causal models contribute to hindsight bias by describing how knowing outcomes leads us to believe they were more predictable than they actually were, which matches the answer key's point about events seeming more inevitable than they were.

Score: 1.0

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Learning is unavoidable. As we acquire new knowledge, past events seem more inevitable than they originally appeared (meaning we naturally tend to create causal explanations for what occurred).

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that learning makes past events seem more inevitable and that we naturally create causal explanations after acquiring new knowledge. This captures the core concept that newly learned information cannot be avoided when estimating past likelihood judgments, which is the essence of hindsight bias.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing involves seeking the optimal option, whereas satisficing means settling for an option that is good enough. This individual likely exhibits a maximizing decision style.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as seeking the optimal option, which aligns with the answer key's description of trying to make the best choice.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as settling for an option that is good enough, which matches the answer key's definition of making a good-enough choice.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that someone high in neuroticism would likely exhibit a maximizing decision style, matching the answer key's requirement.

Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

I would incorporate statistical data and AI models into my teaching instead of relying solely on clinical intuition. These tools could assist me in developing course material templates, identifying patterns more clearly (such as tracking student performance on quizzes), and offering more effective general feedback than I could provide on my own due to my limited computational skills. Although not flawless, this approach would be acceptable. Additionally, I would ensure there is space for open-ended questions, encouraging students to explore and solve problems independently rather than explaining everything to them. Assigning roles for group work could also be beneficial for reinforcing their theoretical knowledge in practical contexts. Lastly, I would aim to create positive associations with the course, which might act as a subtle form of influence, similar to nudges, to shift their mindset toward prioritizing understanding concepts over rote memorization. Using a digital logbook for students to record their daily course-related activities could also be helpful, as the awareness that others are participating might motivate them to engage as well, and feeling left out could create a mild personal discomfort.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement with the question by providing multiple concrete strategies for encouraging student engagement within resource constraints. They address the core challenge of limited time/resources by suggesting AI-assisted tools for feedback and pattern recognition, propose active learning methods like open-ended questions and group work with assigned roles, discuss psychological approaches like creating positive associations and social influence through digital logbooks, and show understanding of pedagogical principles by emphasizing conceptual understanding over memorization. The response is thoughtful, practical, and directly addresses the question's parameters.
