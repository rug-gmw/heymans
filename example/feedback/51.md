Grade: 5.5

## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

The Social-Intuitionist model emphasizes the importance of emotions and bodily signals in moral decision-making, aligning with System 1 thinking. This intuitive process is the main mode of thought in the model, while System 2 thinking occurs later, involving reflection on the initial emotional responses, like considering one's anger.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 thinking involves emotions and intuitive processes in the social-intuitionist model.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies System 2 thinking as involving reflection and consideration of responses, which aligns with reasoning/deliberation.
- Correct: The student clearly states that the intuitive process (System 1) is the 'main mode of thought' in the model, correctly identifying its dominance over System 2.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

This relates to the representativeness heuristic, where individuals are categorized into a particular group based on how closely they match the typical or stereotypical characteristics of that group.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process in this scenario.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that the representativeness heuristic involves categorizing individuals based on how closely they match stereotypical characteristics of a group, which captures the essence of estimating likelihood based on resemblance to stereotypes.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring involves relying on an initial piece of information as a reference point to evaluate any subsequent information. Because it focuses on the first information received, it resembles the primacy effect, where early information has a stronger impact on memory.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as relying on initial information as a reference point, which captures the essence of taking the first piece of information as the starting point.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of the primacy effect by explaining that early information has stronger impact on memory, which aligns with better remembering the first piece of information.
- Correct: The student explicitly connects both concepts by noting that anchoring 'focuses on the first information received' and 'resembles the primacy effect,' showing they understand both involve overreliance on first information.

Score: 1.0

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency to avoid losses whenever possible. In contrast, risk aversion is centered on a preference for certainty, where individuals favor a smaller, guaranteed gain over a larger, uncertain one that carries a higher risk of loss.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes loss aversion as 'tendency to avoid losses whenever possible' which misses the key concept that losses are weighted more heavily than equivalent gains. The answer doesn't capture the asymmetric valuation between losses and gains.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies risk aversion as a preference for certainty over uncertainty, accurately describing it as favoring smaller guaranteed gains over larger uncertain ones with risk of loss.

Score: 0.5

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias is the tendency to overpredict how much we will enjoy future experiences and underpredict how much we will dislike them. As a result, we anticipate that future circumstances will improve and behave based on that expectation, which often leads us to remain in unhappy relationships, hoping for a better outcome down the line.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly defines impact bias as overpredicting enjoyment and underpredicting dislike of future experiences. The correct definition is the tendency to overestimate the impact (intensity and duration) of future events on our feelings, not specifically about enjoyment/dislike predictions.
- Incorrect: The student explains that impact bias causes people to stay in relationships by hoping for better outcomes, but this misses the key point. Impact bias prevents breakups because people overestimate how bad the breakup itself will make them feel, not because they expect the relationship to improve.

Score: 0.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves anticipating whether you will experience positive or negative emotions about a future event. People often misjudge the intensity of their feelings, which can influence choices about treatments in the future.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies affective forecasting as predicting future emotional states, though they phrase it as anticipating positive/negative emotions rather than explicitly stating 'predictions about our own future emotional state.'
- Incorrect: The student mentions that people misjudge emotional intensity and this influences treatment choices, but fails to address the specific contrast between healthy people's predictions about preferring death when sick versus their actual preferences when they become sick.

Score: 0.5

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

Events with extremely low probabilities are considered impossible and ignored. However, low probabilities are not viewed in the same way. As a result, people often underestimate the likelihood of low-probability events.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that people underestimate low probabilities, when according to prospect theory, merely low probabilities are actually overestimated.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that extremely low probabilities are considered impossible and ignored, which aligns with the answer key point about extremely low probabilities being interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 0.5

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion involves steering clear of scenarios with low value, which are unfavorable, thereby reducing the chances of encountering low-value outcomes.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's answer describes general risk-averse behavior but does not address the key concept of loss aversion in prospect theory - that negative utilities (losses) are weighted more heavily than equivalent positive utilities (gains). The answer lacks any mention of the asymmetric weighting of losses versus gains or the steeper value function for losses.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory considers only monetary amounts, whereas expected utility theory emphasizes utility, which reflects how desirable an option or situation is. Unlike expected value theory, expected utility theory accounts for reference dependence, meaning that the current wealth level influences the utility derived from a decision.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory deals with monetary amounts while expected utility theory deals with utility (desirability), which aligns with the answer key's distinction between financial and non-financial values.
- Incorrect: The student mentions reference dependence and wealth level effects, but fails to identify risk aversion as the key heuristic/bias consideration that distinguishes expected utility theory from expected value theory.

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected value theory involves making decisions based on the anticipated value of an option. Expected Utility theory centers on selecting options according to the expected personal utility they provide. MAUT considers that decisions are made by evaluating multiple attributes simultaneously. Take the Best emphasizes choosing the option that is sufficiently satisfactory for the specific situation.

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies expected value theory as making decisions based on anticipated value, which aligns with the normative model involving financial outcomes and probabilities.
- Correct: Student correctly describes expected utility theory as selecting options based on expected personal utility, which matches the concept of subjective utility rather than just financial outcomes.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies MAUT as considering multiple attributes simultaneously in decision-making, which aligns with the multi-attribute utility theory concept.
- Incorrect: Student describes 'Take the Best' rather than Prospect Theory. The answer key requires Prospect Theory as a descriptive behavioral model with heuristics and biases, not a satisficing heuristic.

Score: 0.75

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

People tend to steer clear of risks to minimize losses, since risks are uncertain and carry the possibility that the outcome may be unfavorable, resulting in a loss.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that people avoid risks to minimize losses, which suggests loss aversion increases risk aversion. The correct answer is that loss aversion can actually decrease risk aversion and make people risk-seeking when trying to avoid potential losses.

Score: 0.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning is basically the process of forming associations. In classical conditioning, a neutral stimulus is paired with a stimulus that will become conditioned, so that eventually the conditioned stimulus triggers the same response as the original neutral stimulus. Operant conditioning, on the other hand, is about learning behaviors through consequences, where actions are influenced by rewards or punishments.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as 'forming associations,' which aligns with the answer key's definition of 'learning associations through covariation.'
- Incorrect: The student's explanation of classical conditioning focuses on stimulus-response pairing but misses the key concept that it's about learning associations when two things happen together in time and space. The terminology used is also somewhat confused (neutral stimulus paired with stimulus that becomes conditioned).
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning behaviors through consequences where actions are influenced by rewards or punishments, which matches the answer key's definition.

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation involves mistakenly perceiving a cause-and-effect relationship when none exists. Illusory correlation, on the other hand, involves identifying connections between unrelated things without implying a causal link.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly defines illusory causation as perceiving causation when none exists, rather than misinterpreting an existing correlation as causation. They also incorrectly define illusory correlation as identifying connections between unrelated things, rather than perceiving correlation where none actually exists.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

Conducting oneself at a birthday party follows a script, as it represents a culturally specific pattern of appropriate behavior for that context. In contrast, grasping the healthcare system involves a schema, where you connect various related ideas—like insurance, calling emergency number 112, and visiting a doctor—within an overarching framework.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that understanding the Dutch healthcare system is a schema and provides a good explanation that it involves connecting various related ideas (insurance, emergency numbers, visiting doctors) within an overarching framework, which aligns with the concept of schemas as knowledge structures and relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that behaving at a birthday party is a script and provides an accurate explanation that it represents a culturally specific pattern of appropriate behavior for that context, which matches the answer key's description of scripts as social schemas describing situational behavior.

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

Behaviorists concentrated their analysis exclusively on behavior as a response to stimuli, ignoring neural mechanisms and cognitive processes in favor of observable actions.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly describes behaviorist methodology but fails to identify which of Dennett's stances this represents. The answer does not mention the physical stance or explain why behaviorists adopted this particular level of analysis.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

Evolutionary psychologists examine a sequence of layers, starting with the influence of evolutionary mechanisms on behavior and how this subsequently impacts social phenomena. Essentially, it combines various levels into a comprehensive explanation.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes evolutionary psychology as examining multiple layers and combining levels of analysis, but fails to identify the specific stance (design stance) that evolutionary psychologists adopt according to Dennett's framework. The answer does not address the key concept that evolutionary psychologists focus on function/purpose, which characterizes the design stance.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Temporal consistency --> If B happens shortly after A, then A is likely the cause. Spatial consistency --> If B occurs near A, it is probable that A caused it. Illusory causation --> We believe one event causes another even when it does not. Illusory correlation --> We assume a connection between two or more factors where none exists. False similarity --> We think events are caused by factors that look alike or correspond in magnitude to the outcome.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions spatial and temporal aspects but does not identify distinctness/specificity as a separate heuristic. They don't explain that B should follow A but not other events.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention consistency as described in the answer key (that B always follows A). Their 'temporal consistency' refers to timing rather than reliability of the A-B relationship.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention plausibility. Instead they discuss 'illusory causation' which is about false beliefs rather than using common sense to judge causation.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies both temporal and spatial contiguity, explaining that events occurring close in time and space are more likely to be causally related.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies similarity in cause and effect with 'false similarity,' explaining that we think events are caused by factors that look alike or correspond in magnitude.

Score: 0.4

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

We often believe that others hold fewer mistaken beliefs, which can lead us to think that moral outrage is more widespread than it actually is. The fundamental attribution error—attributing actions and thoughts to a person's internal traits—suggests that moral outrage could genuinely reflect one's character, meaning that the more people display it, the more prevalent moral outrage truly is.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student does not mention the negativity bias at all. Instead, they discuss believing others hold fewer mistaken beliefs, which is not related to the negativity bias concept from the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention the availability heuristic. They discuss the fundamental attribution error instead, which is a different cognitive bias not mentioned in the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student does not explain the interaction between negativity bias and availability heuristic. Their explanation focuses on fundamental attribution error and actually suggests moral outrage IS more prevalent, contradicting the premise that we overestimate it.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

This refers to applying knowledge from one area too broadly to another, such as taking biological germ theory and associating it with an object owned by someone you dislike, believing that the item has been contaminated.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that this is about applying knowledge from one domain (biological/germ theory) inappropriately to another domain (social/psychological), which matches the answer key's explanation of biological contagion concepts being incorrectly applied to the social domain.

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

I would argue that the level of evidence and reasoning supporting a conspiracy theory is what separates those that are delusional from those that are not.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student focuses only on evidence and reasoning quality, missing the key distinction that a delusional conspiracy theory requires both irrational belief AND lack of common acceptance. The answer key specifies that social acceptance is a crucial component alongside irrationality.

Score: 0.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

Neuroticism stems from the desire for clear and straightforward information, favoring simple explanations. The presence of a dominant group controlling everything provides a convenient explanation for all facts. Narcissism involves the wish to possess exclusive knowledge that others do not have.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that conspiratorial thinking involves 'favoring simple explanations' which matches the answer key point about 'believing in simple explanations for complex events.'
- Correct: The student correctly mentions narcissism as a factor, describing it as 'the wish to possess exclusive knowledge that others do not have,' which aligns with the narcissistic trait listed in the answer key.
- Incorrect: While the student mentions neuroticism, this is not listed as one of the cognitive and personality factors in the answer key. The student needed to identify a third factor from the provided list such as seeing patterns in randomness, believing paranormal phenomena, or attributing agency where it doesn't exist.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Corrective feedback is important because without it, you may continue to believe and rely on an incorrect answer, preventing you from learning the right one and leading to misplaced confidence.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The answer describes the importance of corrective feedback but does not identify the specific psychological mechanism through which incorrect answers interfere with learning. The answer key requires naming source amnesia, proactive interference, or the continued-influence effect as the mechanism.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

The anchor heuristic works because frequently repeating a statement makes it more prominent in people's minds, causing it to serve as a framework for interpreting new information. This benefits the politician by allowing them to set the initial reference point.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the anchoring heuristic as the mechanism. The correct answer is mere exposure effect (tendency to prefer familiar things) or illusory-truth effect. While the student mentions repetition making statements more prominent, they focus on anchoring and reference points rather than familiarity breeding preference or repeated exposure creating perceived truthfulness.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

That might indeed be true if they are more prone to projection bias, where they extend their present emotions onto future events and circumstances, leading them to exaggerate their anticipated dislike or negative feelings.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly suggests that depression leads to less accuracy due to projection bias and exaggerated negative predictions. The answer key indicates that people with major depressive disorder are actually MORE accurate because they have reduced optimism bias, not because they over-predict negative outcomes.

Score: 0.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

As sensory information becomes less reliable, our existing beliefs have a stronger impact. Our perception is shaped more by our expectations, leading us to mentally complete gaps with what we anticipate to be present.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when sensory information becomes less reliable, prior beliefs have a stronger impact on perception, and that perception becomes more influenced by expectations. This directly matches the answer key's requirement that perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs when sensory reliability decreases.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

The pre-conventional stage involves children making moral choices to avoid punishment and gain approval from authority figures. The conventional stage is characterized by decisions guided by societal rules, norms, and traditions. The post-conventional stage is when moral judgments are founded on universal ethical principles and a consideration for the rights of others.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the pre-conventional level as focusing on avoiding punishment and gaining approval from authority figures, which aligns with the answer key's emphasis on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as being guided by societal rules, norms, and traditions, which matches the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the post-conventional level as being based on universal ethical principles and consideration for others' rights, which aligns with the answer key's description of focusing on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

Causal models typically suggest particular causes for particular outcomes. When we observe an effect, we often assume that a specific cause was responsible for it. Looking back, it appears logical that the cause must have occurred before the effect and was somewhat predetermined.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that causal models connect causes to outcomes and create logical explanations for events, which aligns with the concept of a coherent narrative relating past events.
- Correct: The student accurately describes how causal models make events appear 'predetermined' when looking back, which directly captures how they contribute to hindsight bias by making outcomes seem more inevitable than they actually were.

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Once you discover the correct answer, you tend to reshape or misremember your original response to better match the accurate one you've just acquired. Consequently, acquiring new information increases the chances of hindsight bias occurring.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that learning new information leads to hindsight bias by explaining that people reshape or misremember their original judgments to align with newly acquired knowledge, which captures the core concept that newly learned information cannot be avoided when estimating past likelihood judgments.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing involves striving for the optimal result, while satisficing focuses on achieving an acceptable or adequate outcome based on the circumstances. A person with a high level of Neuroticism is more likely to be a maximizer, often exhibiting traits like perfectionism.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as 'striving for the optimal result' which aligns with 'trying to make the best choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as 'achieving an acceptable or adequate outcome' which matches the concept of 'making a good-enough choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that someone high in neuroticism is 'more likely to be a maximizer' and provides relevant reasoning about perfectionism traits.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

I would develop a curriculum by combining methods similar to clinical intuition (drawing on my experience to determine what is valuable to teach), statistical prediction (using data from large groups to identify what benefits students most), and decision support systems. This approach ensures all students receive the most effective learning material, prioritizing essentials over extras. Subsequently, employing software or AI to assess whether the learning objectives have been achieved, as Sebastiaan currently does, would be the most efficient use of limited time and resources.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement by proposing a structured approach that combines clinical intuition, statistical prediction, and decision support systems. They address the core challenge of limited resources by suggesting AI/software for assessment and show understanding of course concepts by referencing methods discussed in class. The answer is thoughtful and practically oriented.
