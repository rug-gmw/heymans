## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidtâ€™s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

The social-intuitionist model describes system 1 thinking as intuitive decision making, while system 2 thinking involves moral reasoning. This model suggests that intuitive decision making, or system 1 thinking, is the most influential.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies System 1 thinking as intuitive decision making, which aligns with the answer key's requirement for System 1 to refer to intuitions.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies System 2 thinking as involving moral reasoning, which matches the answer key's requirement for System 2 to refer to reasoning.
- Correct: The student correctly states that intuitive decision making (System 1 thinking) is the most influential, which satisfies the answer key's requirement that System 1 is more dominant than System 2.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

The representativeness heuristic is when we assume that if something resembles the typical example of category B, then it is likely to be B, without considering the actual likelihood of A being B.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive bias in this scenario.
- Correct: The student accurately explains the representativeness heuristic as making judgments based on resemblance to typical examples/stereotypes of a category, which matches the key concept of estimating likelihood based on similarity to stereotypes.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring refers to the initial information people notice about a person or object, which they use as a reference point for making further judgments or adjustments. The primacy effect highlights the significance of first impressions, emphasizing that while recent experiences may slightly influence how someone is perceived, the initial impression remains difficult to alter.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as using initial information as a reference point for further judgments, which aligns with the answer key's definition of taking the first piece of information as the starting point.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as emphasizing the significance of first impressions that are difficult to alter, which corresponds to the answer key's point about better remembering the first piece of information.
- Incorrect: The student does not explicitly identify what anchoring and the primacy effect have in common - their shared overreliance on first information. While their descriptions implicitly suggest this connection, they fail to directly state the commonality.

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency to feel the pain of losing something more strongly than the pleasure of gaining the same amount. Simply put, losing 100 dollars causes more distress than the happiness gained from winning 100 dollars. Risk aversion, on the other hand, is the preference to steer clear of risky situations.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly explains that loss aversion involves weighing losses more heavily than equivalent gains, using a clear example of $100 loss vs $100 gain to illustrate the concept.
- Correct: The student accurately describes risk aversion as preferring to avoid risky situations, which aligns with the preference for certainty over uncertainty from the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

The impact bias, a component of affective forecasting, refers to our tendency to overpredict the emotional effects of a choice. For example, when considering ending a relationship, people often believe they will feel sad for a prolonged period. This bias can discourage them from breaking up, even if they are unhappy, because the actual emotional impact is usually less severe than anticipated.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as the tendency to overpredict emotional effects of future events/choices, which aligns with the answer key's definition of overestimating the impact of future events on future feelings.
- Correct: The student accurately explains how impact bias prevents breakups by describing that people overestimate how bad they will feel after breaking up, which matches the answer key's explanation that people overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves making choices based on how we anticipate feeling about them later on. Many young individuals claim they would prefer death over being ill or disabled. However, when faced with such circumstances, people frequently choose to continue living. This is crucial to keep in mind in end-of-life scenarios because when someone is suffering severely and had earlier expressed a wish to die under those conditions but now wants to live, it creates a very difficult decision to navigate.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that affective forecasting involves predicting future emotional states, though they phrase it as 'making choices based on how we anticipate feeling about them later on' which captures the essence of predicting future emotional responses.
- Correct: The student accurately explains the key phenomenon where healthy people predict they would prefer death when sick/disabled, but when actually in those circumstances, they often choose to continue living, demonstrating understanding of the discrepancy between predicted and actual preferences.

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

People often overrate small probabilities, such as 10%. However, when probabilities are extremely low, like 0.01%, people generally perceive them as impossible.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people overrate (overestimate) small probabilities like 10%, which aligns with the answer key's point about merely low probabilities being overestimated.
- Correct: The student accurately states that extremely low probabilities like 0.01% are perceived as impossible, which matches the answer key's point about extremely low probabilities being interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

In prospect theory, loss aversion is represented as a positive utility gained when a loss is successfully avoided.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly describes loss aversion as utility gained from avoiding losses, rather than the correct concept that negative utilities (losses) are weighted more heavily than positive utilities (gains) of the same magnitude in the value function.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory focuses solely on economic scenarios, whereas expected utility theory can address subjective matters beyond economics. Additionally, expected utility theory incorporates the likelihood of each event occurring in its predictions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory focuses on economic/financial scenarios while expected utility theory addresses broader subjective matters, which aligns with the answer key's distinction between financial and non-financial values.
- Incorrect: The student mentions that expected utility theory incorporates likelihood of events, but this is incorrect - both theories use probabilities. The key difference is that expected utility theory considers risk aversion, which the student did not mention.

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesnâ€™t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

The expected value theory serves as the foundation for economic decision making. The expected utility theory builds upon this, extending beyond purely economic factors to incorporate subjective elements and predicting the likelihood of each possible event. The multi-attribute utility theory resembles the expected utility theory but assigns a weight to each potential event instead of using probabilities. Prospect theory is a descriptive model that incorporates biases and heuristics, providing a more realistic depiction of the choices people tend to make.

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies expected value theory as foundational for economic decision making and implies it deals with financial outcomes, which aligns with the normative model concept from the answer key.
- Incorrect: Student mentions subjective elements correctly but incorrectly states that expected utility theory predicts likelihood of events - the theory uses given probabilities rather than predicting them.
- Incorrect: Student confuses multi-attribute utility theory with expected utility theory by mentioning 'events' and 'weights instead of probabilities' - MAUT actually deals with multiple attributes of options, not events with weights.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies prospect theory as a descriptive model that incorporates biases and heuristics, accurately capturing its behavioral nature.

Score: 0.5

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease peopleâ€™s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Loss aversion influences how risk averse individuals are by highlighting that people feel the pain of losing $100 more strongly than the pleasure of gaining $100. This impacts their risk tolerance depending on their outlook on the future. When people are optimistic, they tend to avoid risks because their loss aversion makes potential losses feel more significant. Conversely, those who are less optimistic about the future exhibit lower risk aversion, as loss aversion has less influence on them, making them more open to taking risks.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly describes loss aversion's effect on risk aversion. They suggest optimistic people become more risk averse due to loss aversion, but the key point is that loss aversion actually makes people risk-seeking when facing potential losses (to avoid those losses). The student misses the core concept that people will accept risk to avoid losses, making them less risk averse or even risk-seeking in loss domains.

Score: 0.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves learning the relationship between two variables. Classical conditioning demonstrates two events occurring one after the other; when one event happens, the other follows. Operant conditioning, on the other hand, involves learning based on the consequences of actions, such as rewards or punishments.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that conditioning involves learning relationships/associations between variables, which aligns with the key concept of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as two events occurring in sequence where one event predicts another, which captures the essence of learning associations through temporal covariation.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning based on consequences of actions, specifically mentioning rewards and punishments, which matches the answer key definition.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation occurs when individuals believe there is a cause-and-effect link between two variables, even though no such relationship exists. They assume A causes B, but this is incorrect; for instance, A might just be associated with B, or B might actually cause A. Illusory correlation refers to the mistaken belief that two variables are relatedâ€”increasing or decreasing togetherâ€”when, in fact, no true correlation exists between them.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly defines illusory causation as believing a causal relationship exists when none exists at all. The correct definition is that illusory causation occurs when a correlation is misinterpreted as causation - meaning there IS a correlation, but it's wrongly assumed to be causal. The student got illusory correlation correct but missed the key distinction that illusory causation involves misinterpreting an existing correlation.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to â€˜properlyâ€™ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

The Dutch healthcare system is considered a schema because it involves guidelines and the way things are organized. A script, on the other hand, refers to expected behavior in a typical scenario, such as how one should act at a birthday party.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the Dutch healthcare system as a schema and provides a reasonable explanation that it involves 'guidelines and the way things are organized,' which aligns with the concept of schemas as knowledge structures about relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies birthday party behavior as a script and accurately explains that scripts refer to 'expected behavior in a typical scenario,' which matches the answer key's description of scripts as social schemas for specific situational behavior.

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

The physical stance focuses on the causes of behavior, examining what triggers it rather than just the behavior itself (mechanical stance) or the intentions behind it (intentional stance).

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that behaviorists adopted the physical stance and provides accurate reasoning - they focused on examining what triggers behavior (stimuli-response relationships) rather than internal mental states or intentions, which aligns with the behaviorist emphasis on observable cause-and-effect processes.

Score: 1.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

Evolutionary psychologists take an intentional perspective, considering that behaviors like ingroup favoritism involve people reflecting on others and reasoning about why they should act in specific ways, rather than merely observing the behaviors themselves or how they are performed.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the intentional stance rather than the design stance. While the student shows some understanding of Dennett's levels of analysis, they misapply it - evolutionary psychology focuses on the functional purpose/design of psychological processes (design stance), not on the beliefs and desires that guide behavior (intentional stance).

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

A is linked to B with the following conditions: A leads to B, and no other factor causes B. The relationship is directional, with A causing B rather than the reverse. This connection is consistent, meaning A always results in B, and B cannot be more accurately attributed to a different cause.

Feedback:

- Correct: Student mentions 'no other factor causes B' which captures the essence of distinctness/specificity - that B follows A but not other events.
- Correct: Student explicitly states 'A always results in B' which directly corresponds to the consistency heuristic.
- Incorrect: Student does not mention plausibility or common sense as a factor in determining causation.
- Incorrect: Student does not mention temporal or spatial contiguity as a heuristic for causation.
- Incorrect: Student does not mention similarity between cause and effect as a heuristic for causation.

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

The availability bias and negativity bias are involved here. The availability bias means people tend to focus on information that is easily accessible or immediately visible. On social media, posts or images from morally outraged individuals attract a lot of attention, making them more prominent and easy to find. This leads us to overestimate the number of people who are morally outraged based on what we observe online. The negativity bias plays a role by causing people to perceive situations as worse than they really are and actively look for negative content. When we concentrate only on negative posts, including those from morally outraged users on social media, we end up exaggerating how many such individuals exist.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias and explains it as the tendency to focus on and seek out negative content, which aligns with the answer key's definition of placing more weight on negative information like morally outraged content.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies availability bias (heuristic) and explains it as focusing on easily accessible information, which matches the answer key's concept of estimating frequency based on ease of recall, though they don't explicitly mention the estimation aspect.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of how these biases work together - negativity bias makes morally outraged content more prominent and accessible, which through availability bias leads to overestimation of moral outrage frequency, matching the causal relationship described in the answer key.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

Framework theories suggest that there is a shared understanding of values and social interactions among people. This concept of magical contagion is included in these collective agreements that everyone acknowledges and believes in.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes framework theories as shared social understandings but fails to identify the key concept: that magical contagion involves incorrectly applying biological domain knowledge (where contagion is real) to the social/psychological domain (where it's not actually applicable). The answer doesn't mention domain-specific knowledge or cross-domain misapplication.

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A delusional conspiracy theory differs from a non-delusional one in that the latter is typically supported by a community of believers, whereas a delusional conspiracy theory is usually recognized as false by most people and originates from an individual who may have a psychological condition such as schizophrenia.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student focuses on community support and psychological conditions but misses the key distinction from the answer key. The answer key defines delusional conspiracy theories as those that are both irrational beliefs AND not commonly accepted, while non-delusional ones fail to meet both criteria. The student doesn't address the irrationality component and incorrectly suggests that community support alone determines the distinction.

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

Three factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking include being male, seeking simple answers to complicated problems, and having faith in improbable events.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'being male' which corresponds to 'being a man' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student mentions 'seeking simple answers to complicated problems' which accurately reflects 'believing in simple explanations for complex events' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student states 'having faith in improbable events' which corresponds to 'believing paranormal phenomena' from the answer key, as both involve belief in unlikely or unexplained occurrences.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you donâ€™t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

If you are unsure about what is right or wrong, it will become harder to recall over time.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's answer describes general difficulty with recall over time but does not identify any specific psychological mechanism. The answer key requires identifying source amnesia, proactive interference, or the continued-influence effect as mechanisms by which incorrect answers interfere with learning.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

The mental process known as mere exposure.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'mere exposure' as the psychological mechanism, which matches the answer key exactly. The response demonstrates understanding of the concept that repeated exposure to stimuli increases preference for them.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

No, major depressive disorder does not impair people's ability to make accurate predictions; rather, it causes them to be less optimistic. Those without the disorder tend to have an overly positive and unrealistic view of the likelihood of negative events occurring. This unrealistic optimism is actually an indication of good mental health. In contrast, individuals with major depressive disorder have a more pessimistic but also more realistic perspective.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people with major depressive disorder are more accurate at predictions due to reduced optimism bias, and properly explains that non-depressed individuals tend to be overly optimistic. The answer captures the key concept that depression leads to more realistic (though pessimistic) assessments.

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

As sensory information becomes less reliable, prior beliefs have a stronger impact.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that prior beliefs have stronger influence when sensory information becomes less reliable, which directly matches the key concept from the answer key.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You donâ€™t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other peopleâ€™s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

The preconventional stage focuses solely on what benefits yourself. The conventional stage involves considering what is beneficial for others and what is legally right. Finally, the postconventional stage includes reflecting on the ethical dimensions of a situation.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that the preconventional level focuses on self-interest, which aligns with avoiding punishment and gaining rewards as described in the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as considering what benefits others and legal requirements, which corresponds to focusing on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly characterizes the postconventional level as reflecting on ethical dimensions, which matches the focus on abstract principles and values from the answer key.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

One factor that leads to hindsight bias is illusory causation, a concept where people perceive a cause-and-effect relationship between factors even when none exists. This fuels hindsight bias by making individuals believe that certain outcomes were predictable and that they anticipated them from the start.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student discusses 'illusory causation' rather than defining a causal model as a coherent narrative of how past events are related. While related concepts, the student doesn't address what a causal model actually is.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that perceived cause-and-effect relationships make outcomes seem predictable and inevitable, which aligns with how causal models contribute to hindsight bias by making events seem more inevitable than they were.

Score: 0.5

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Learning plays a role in hindsight bias because once you know the factors that caused an event, it's very difficult to view the situation without that knowledge. As a result, after the event occurs, you tend to believe that you predicted it all along.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that learning makes it difficult to view past situations without newly acquired knowledge, which aligns with the key concept that newly learned information cannot be avoided when estimating past likelihood judgments. The explanation captures the essence of how learning contributes to hindsight bias.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

The maximizing decision style suggests that individuals strive to choose the optimal option every time. In contrast, the satisficing decision style implies that people settle for a choice that meets their minimum criteria and aligns with the amount of time and effort they are ready to invest. Those who have a high level of neuroticism are more likely to use the maximizing decision style.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as striving to choose the optimal option, which aligns with 'trying to make the best choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as settling for a choice that meets minimum criteria, which captures the essence of 'making a good-enough choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that those high in neuroticism are more likely to use the maximizing decision style, matching the answer key exactly.

Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point.

Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

I believe it would be beneficial to offer various ways to interact with the content, as different students have unique learning preferences. For instance, some students attend every class because they find it valuable and appreciate the opportunity to ask the teacher questions. Others may struggle to concentrate during long lectures, making attendance difficult. For these students, having a summary of the lessons or links to short YouTube videos that explain key concepts can be very helpful. Additionally, some students learn best through practice; for them, access to a practice exam before the real one is useful. Assignments that require thorough study of the material also support active engagement and help ensure a deeper understanding.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement with the question by providing multiple concrete strategies for promoting active learning within resource constraints. They show understanding of diverse learning preferences and offer practical solutions like video summaries, practice exams, and assignments that don't require personalized grading. The answer reflects thoughtful consideration of the pedagogical challenge presented.
