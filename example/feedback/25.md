## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidtâ€™s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

The social-intuitionist model suggests that moral reasoning primarily relies on intuitive system 1 thinking, which operates quickly but is influenced by emotions. System 2 comes into play afterward to provide reasons supporting our moral decisions. While both systems contribute to moral reasoning, system 1 thinking plays the more prominent role.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 thinking involves intuitive processes and mentions it is influenced by emotions, which aligns with the answer key's requirement about System 1 being intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student accurately describes System 2 as providing reasons and supporting moral decisions, which corresponds to the answer key's definition of System 2 as reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student clearly states that 'system 1 thinking plays the more prominent role' and that moral reasoning 'primarily relies on intuitive system 1 thinking,' which directly addresses the dominance of System 1 over System 2.

Score: 1.0

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

This assumption arises from the representativeness heuristic, which leads us to estimate the likelihood that a person is part of a group based on how closely they resemble typical members of that group. Essentially, it relies on the straightforward rule that if A looks like B, then A is likely B.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process in this scenario.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that the representativeness heuristic involves estimating likelihood of category membership based on resemblance to typical group members, which matches the answer key's explanation about estimating likelihood based on resemblance to stereotypes.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

An anchor is the initial impression we form about a situation, such as during a job interview. This initial judgment acts as a baseline, with subsequent impressions being used to modify this original reference point. The primacy effect refers to the lasting impact that the first impression has on how we perceive the situation. Both concepts highlight the significant role that the initial impression plays in shaping our overall evaluation.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as taking an initial impression/judgment as a baseline or reference point, which aligns with the answer key's definition of taking the first piece of information as a starting point.
- Incorrect: The student describes the primacy effect as the lasting impact of first impressions rather than the tendency to better remember the first piece of information, which is the key distinction in memory retention.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both concepts involve the significant role of initial impressions in shaping evaluation, which corresponds to overreliance on the first piece of information.

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the instinctive preference to perceive losses as more severe than the equivalent gains are rewarding, leading us to steer clear of losses when facing risky choices. Risk aversion, on the other hand, describes our general inclination to avoid taking risks, favoring guaranteed results instead of uncertain possibilities.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves weighing losses more heavily than equivalent gains and describes the tendency to avoid losses, which aligns with the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes risk aversion as the inclination to avoid risks and favor guaranteed results over uncertain possibilities, which matches the answer key's definition of preferring certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 1.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias refers to the common tendency to exaggerate how much our present choices will influence our future emotions. This bias might cause individuals to avoid ending a relationship, as they anticipate experiencing intense regret and sadness afterward, leading them to remain in an unhappy partnership.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as the tendency to exaggerate how much present choices will influence future emotions, which captures the essence of overestimating the impact of future events on future feelings.
- Correct: The student accurately explains how impact bias prevents breakups by describing how people anticipate intense negative emotions (regret and sadness) after breaking up, causing them to stay in unhappy relationships.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting refers to how we anticipate our future emotions when making choices. Often, we are inaccurate at this and tend to overestimate how much our present decisions will affect our future feelings, a tendency known as impact bias. This is particularly relevant for decisions made at the end of life, such as creating a living will, where we must decide about our future with incomplete knowledge. There's no way to be sure if we'll still hold the same views years down the line.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines affective forecasting as anticipating or predicting future emotions, which aligns with the answer key's definition of 'predictions about our own future emotional state.'
- Correct: The student addresses the core concept from the answer key about discrepancies between predicted and actual preferences, explaining that we may be inaccurate at predicting future emotions and that our views may change over time, which captures the essence of healthy people potentially changing their preferences when actually facing illness.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

Prospect theory suggests that individuals tend to overvalue small probabilities, perceiving a 10% chance as significantly higher than it truly is. However, it also indicates that very tiny probabilities, such as 0.01%, are typically underestimated and considered nearly impossible, despite their actual possibility.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that merely low probabilities (like 10%) are overestimated, stating they are 'perceived as significantly higher than it truly is.'
- Correct: The student accurately describes that extremely low probabilities (like 0.01%) are treated as near impossibilities, saying they are 'considered nearly impossible' which aligns with the answer key point about being interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion describes our inclination to steer clear of negative experiences. According to prospect theory, these situations are viewed as losses, which we aim to prevent because they carry negative value.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes loss aversion as avoiding negative experiences and losses having negative value, but fails to capture the key concept that losses are weighted more heavily than equivalent gains. The answer doesn't explain that the utility function is steeper for losses than gains, which is the core insight of loss aversion in prospect theory.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory and expected utility theory differ in the types of outcomes they emphasize. Expected value theory concentrates solely on monetary results, while expected utility theory includes both financial and non-financial factors. Consequently, expected utility theory is more subjective, as it evaluates the desirability of outcomes based on money, effort, and the likelihood of those outcomes happening. In contrast, expected value theory remains objective by focusing only on the monetary worth of an outcome and its probability.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory deals only with monetary/financial values while expected utility theory includes both financial and non-financial factors, which matches the first point in the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student discusses subjectivity vs objectivity and mentions factors like effort and likelihood, but does not address the key distinction about heuristics/biases vs risk aversion that is specified in the answer key.

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesnâ€™t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

1. Expected value theory is a normative approach to financial decision-making that relies solely on the monetary outcomes of a choice. It calculates the expected value by multiplying each outcomeâ€™s value by its likelihood, representing the average result if the decision were repeated many times. 2. Expected utility theory is a normative decision-making model that incorporates both financial and non-financial consequences. It assigns a subjective usefulness, or utility, to each outcome, which is then multiplied by its probability to find the expected utility. 3. Multi-attribute utility theory is mainly a normative framework used for complex decisions, where each attribute receives a utility score and a weight reflecting its importance, allowing a calculation to determine the best option. 4. Prospect theory is a descriptive model that builds on expected utility theory by including human heuristics and biases, such as the tendency to evaluate decisions in terms of gains and losses rather than absolute values.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as a normative model focusing on financial outcomes with probabilities, accurately describing the calculation method.
- Correct: The student correctly explains expected utility theory as similar to expected value theory but incorporating subjective utility beyond just financial outcomes.
- Correct: The student accurately describes multi-attribute utility theory as a normative model with multiple attributes, each having utility and weight for decision-making.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies prospect theory as a descriptive model that builds on expected utility theory while incorporating human heuristics and biases.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease peopleâ€™s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency to perceive losses as more impactful than equivalent gains. When outcomes are presented as losses, individuals are more inclined to take risks to prevent them. Conversely, when outcomes are shown as gains, loss aversion has less effect, and people tend to be more cautious.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly explains that loss aversion leads people to take risks when trying to avoid losses, which demonstrates understanding that loss aversion can decrease risk aversion and make people risk-seeking in loss domains.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning refers to acquiring a connection between two elements through simultaneous experience. Classical conditioning involves learning the link between a stimulus and a reward or punishment, while operant conditioning involves learning the relationship between behavior and its social consequences.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as learning connections/associations between elements through experience, which aligns with the answer key's definition of learning associations through covariation.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly describes classical conditioning as learning links between stimulus and reward/punishment, when it should be about temporal/spatial associations between two stimuli or events, not necessarily involving rewards or punishments.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies operant conditioning as learning relationships between behavior and consequences, which matches the answer key's description of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation refers to the tendency to perceive a cause-and-effect relationship when only a correlation is present. Illusory correlation, on the other hand, is the tendency to identify a correlation between two variables even when there is no evident connection.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly distinguishes between illusory causation (incorrectly interpreting correlation as causation) and illusory correlation (perceiving correlation where none exists). The explanation accurately captures the key difference outlined in the answer key.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to â€˜properlyâ€™ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

Understanding the Dutch healthcare system serves as background knowledge that helps us make sense of life and organize new information within our mental framework of a situation, known as a schema. In contrast, a script refers to a culturally specific sequence of social actions we follow to navigate typical social events, such as knowing how to act at a birthday party.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the Dutch healthcare system as a schema and provides an accurate explanation that it serves as background knowledge that helps organize information within a mental framework.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies birthday party behavior as a script and accurately explains it as a culturally specific sequence of social actions for navigating typical social events.

Score: 1.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

Examining Daniel Dennett's perspectives, the behaviorist approach aligns most closely with the physical stance since it centers solely on the connection between stimuli and automatic responses. In contrast, the design stance involves considering the purpose behind a behavior, which is not consistent with behaviorist concepts.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that behaviorists adopted the physical stance and provides accurate reasoning - they focused on the direct causal connection between stimuli and responses without considering mental states or purposes. The contrast with the design stance further demonstrates understanding of Dennett's framework.

Score: 1.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

This connects to the intentional stance, which involves assessing behavior by considering underlying intentions and goals. Viewing ingroup favoritism as a beneficial evolutionary characteristic means that evolutionary psychologists focus on the purpose driving a behavior, aligning with the intentional stance.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the intentional stance instead of the design stance. While they correctly understand that evolutionary psychology focuses on purpose/function, the intentional stance is about attributing beliefs and desires to agents, whereas the design stance is about understanding things in terms of their functional design - which is what evolutionary psychologists do when they analyze psychological processes for their adaptive functions.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

1. Specificity: A probably causes B if B occurs only after A and not after C. 3. Plausibility: A is likely responsible for B when existing knowledge supports that A can lead to B. 4. Contiguity in space and time: A is likely the cause of B if B happens right after A in the same location. 5. Similarity in cause and effect: A is likely to cause B when A and B share strong similarities.

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies specificity/distinctness and explains that B should occur only after A and not after other events (C), which matches the answer key concept.
- Incorrect: Student completely omits the consistency heuristic, which requires that B always follows A.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies plausibility and explains it as existing knowledge supporting that A can lead to B, which aligns with the common sense aspect from the answer key.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies contiguity in space and time, explaining that B should happen right after A in the same location, matching the answer key.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies similarity in cause and effect, explaining that A and B should share strong similarities, which matches the superficial resemblance concept from the answer key.

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

We tend to overestimate moral outrage because of two psychological tendencies: negativity bias and the availability heuristic. Negativity bias refers to our inclination to focus on negative emotions, such as moral outrage seen on social media. The availability heuristic is our tendency to assess how likely something is based on how easily we can recall examples. Since we actively seek out moral outrage content due to negativity bias, and encounter it frequently, the availability heuristic leads us to believe it happens more often than it actually does.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias as our inclination to focus on negative emotions and specifically mentions moral outrage on social media, which aligns with the answer key's definition of seeking out or placing more weight on negative information.
- Correct: The student accurately defines the availability heuristic as our tendency to assess likelihood based on how easily we can recall examples, which matches the answer key's description of estimating frequency based on ease of bringing examples to mind.
- Correct: The student effectively explains the connection between the two biases, stating that negativity bias causes us to seek out moral outrage content, which then makes it more available to recall, leading the availability heuristic to cause overestimation of moral outrage frequency.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

Magical contagion is a mistaken way of thinking where we mistakenly use concepts about how diseases spread in the biological world to interpret situations in the psychological realm. As a result, we believe that a person's negative traits can be passed on to us through an object, which is an error caused by mixing ideas from different domains.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that magical contagion involves the incorrect application of biological domain concepts (disease transmission/contagion) to the psychological/social domain, demonstrating understanding of how framework theories from different knowledge domains can be inappropriately mixed.

Score: 1.0

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A baseless conspiracy theory cannot be true because it contradicts the principles of nature and society. Consequently, it is not commonly accepted, unlike certain conspiracy theories that are more plausible.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions that baseless theories are not commonly accepted, which partially addresses one criterion, but fails to identify the key distinction that delusional conspiracy theories must be both irrational beliefs AND not commonly accepted. The student also doesn't clearly explain what makes a theory 'delusional' versus 'non-delusional' and introduces irrelevant concepts about contradicting principles of nature.

Score: 0.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

Inclination to perceive links Narcissism Belief in the paranormal

Feedback:

- Correct: The student's answer 'Inclination to perceive links' directly corresponds to 'seeing patterns in randomness' from the answer key, which refers to the tendency to find connections where none exist.
- Correct: The student correctly identified 'Narcissism' which matches exactly with 'being narcissistic' listed in the answer key as a personality factor contributing to conspiratorial thinking.
- Correct: The student's answer 'Belief in the paranormal' matches precisely with 'believing paranormal phenomena' from the answer key, which is one of the cognitive factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you donâ€™t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

This phenomenon is known as the backfire effect. When incorrect beliefs are challenged by providing the accurate information, it can actually strengthen the conviction in the false belief. Over time, the difference between the true and false information becomes less clear, causing the incorrect belief to appear more credible. As a result, this hampers learning since individuals hold on to inaccurate knowledge.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes the backfire effect, which is about strengthening false beliefs when challenged with corrections. However, the answer key specifically asks about source amnesia (forgetting that your own incorrect answer was wrong) or proactive interference (initial incorrect answers interfering with correct ones). The backfire effect is a different phenomenon that doesn't directly address the specific mechanism of how one's own incorrect quiz answers interfere with learning.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

Politicians try to strengthen our beliefs by repeatedly stating something, as repeated exposure makes us more likely to accept it as true.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that repeated exposure leads to increased acceptance of statements as true, which directly corresponds to the illusory-truth effect mentioned in the answer key as an alternative correct answer.

Score: 1.0

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Research has shown that individuals with major depressive disorder are less likely to exhibit optimism bias, which is the tendency to view our own actions positively and disregard potential negative risks when forecasting outcomes. While optimism bias is generally linked to good mental health, it can result in less precise predictions. Thus, it is suggested that depression may lead to more accurate forecasting.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people with major depressive disorder are more accurate at predictions due to reduced optimism bias, which aligns with the answer key's point about reduced overly optimistic tendencies leading to greater accuracy.

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

When sensory information becomes less reliable, prior beliefs play a larger role in shaping perception. As a result, our perception relies more on what we expect rather than on the actual sensory input.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when sensory information becomes less reliable, prior beliefs have increased influence on perception, and that perception relies more on expectations rather than actual sensory input. This directly matches the key concept from the answer key.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You donâ€™t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other peopleâ€™s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

Kohlberg outlined three stages of moral development: 1. Pre-conventional, which is centered on avoiding punishment and seeking rewards, with a self-focused perspective; 2. Conventional, which emphasizes conforming to social norms and gaining approval from others, focusing on social relationships; 3. Post-conventional, which involves deeper reflection and recognizing that personal values may sometimes clash, with an emphasis on principles such as justice.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the pre-conventional level as focused on avoiding punishment and seeking rewards, which matches the answer key's description of obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as emphasizing conforming to social norms and gaining approval from others, which aligns with the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the post-conventional level as involving principles such as justice and deeper reflection on values, which matches the answer key's description of focus on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model of past events is created after an event has happened to clarify why it turned out the way it did. Through this process, we aim to rationalize the choices we made before and during the event. This leads to hindsight bias because we include information gained during the event that was not available when the decision was originally made. Building this narrative creates the feeling that we "knew it all along," which is a central aspect of hindsight bias.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a causal model is a narrative constructed to explain past events and their relationships, though they focus more on rationalization than the general coherent narrative aspect.
- Correct: The student accurately explains how causal models contribute to hindsight bias by making events seem more predictable in retrospect ('knew it all along') and mentions how post-event information creates a sense of inevitability.

Score: 1.0

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Learning leads to hindsight bias because once we acquire information about an event, we cannot erase it from our memory. This new knowledge influences how we perceive the event afterward, and even if we try to avoid considering it, we unintentionally do so, causing us to believe we "knew it all along," which is a key aspect of hindsight bias.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that newly learned information cannot be avoided when making retrospective judgments and that this unavoidable influence of new knowledge leads to hindsight bias. This aligns with the answer key's point about being unable to avoid taking newly learned information into account when estimating past likelihood judgments.

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing decision-making involves aiming to choose the very best option, while satisficing means selecting an option that meets acceptable criteria without seeking the absolute best. Neuroticism is more associated with a maximizing style, since the pursuit of the best choice can result in regret, which is a common emotion connected to neurotic characteristics.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as aiming to choose the very best option, which aligns with the answer key's definition of 'trying to make the best choice.'
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as selecting an option that meets acceptable criteria without seeking the absolute best, which matches the answer key's definition of 'making a good-enough choice.'
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that neuroticism is associated with a maximizing style and provides reasonable justification by connecting the pursuit of the best choice to regret, which aligns with neurotic characteristics.

Score: 1.0

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

I believe the best way to handle this situation is by using a multi-attribute decision-making model. Since it is a complex issue, each factor involved should be carefully analyzed and given individual consideration. For instance, employing AI could significantly reduce the time needed for grading, which is highly beneficial and carries considerable importance. However, AI may not make decisions as nuanced as a teacher would, potentially causing students to feel undervalued because less time and resources are dedicated to them. This downside has a negative impact with moderate significance. These examples illustrate just a few of the many factors and their respective importance that must be evaluated in this complex decision. Taking such a detailed and thoughtful approach aligns with psychological principles covered in this course and is likely to produce the best result in this scenario.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement by proposing a multi-attribute decision-making framework, identifying specific trade-offs (AI efficiency vs. human nuance), considering student psychological needs, and connecting their approach to course principles. The answer shows thoughtful analysis of the complex balance between resource constraints and student engagement.
