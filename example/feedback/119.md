## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidtâ€™s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

System 1 tends to be more influential because it processes intuition and emotions rapidly, often relying on biases and heuristics as described by the social intuitionist model. In contrast, System 2 is engaged only in certain situations, such as when there is no immediate emotional reaction or when responses conflict. At that point, conscious reasoning or deliberate thought takes place for moral judgment, indicating that System 2 is active.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 processes intuition and emotions, which aligns with the answer key's requirement that System 1 refers to intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student correctly describes System 2 as involving 'conscious reasoning or deliberate thought,' which matches the answer key's definition of System 2 as reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student clearly states that 'System 1 tends to be more influential,' which directly addresses the answer key requirement that System 1 is more dominant than System 2.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

The representativeness heuristic involves assuming that a colleague belongs to a particular category because they resemble the typical example of that category.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process in this scenario.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that the representativeness heuristic involves judging category membership based on resemblance to typical examples or stereotypes of that category, which matches the key concept in the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring involves establishing an initial price and then negotiating based on that reference point. This initial figure strongly influences the subsequent conversation. The primacy effect explains how we tend to prioritize information encountered first, so anchoring takes advantage of this tendency, significantly shaping the direction of the price discussion.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as using an initial reference point that influences subsequent decisions, though they focus specifically on pricing rather than the broader cognitive concept.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as prioritizing or giving more weight to information encountered first.
- Correct: The student clearly identifies the connection between anchoring and primacy effect, explaining that anchoring takes advantage of the primacy effect's tendency to overweight first information.

Score: 1.0

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the preference for avoiding losses, while risk aversion is the inclination to steer clear of risks that might result in losses.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves the preference for avoiding losses, which captures the core concept that losses are weighted more heavily than equivalent gains.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly defines risk aversion as avoiding risks that might result in losses, rather than the preference for certainty over uncertainty. This conflates risk aversion with loss aversion.

Score: 0.5

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias refers to the tendency to exaggerate the emotional effect an event will have. In this case, a person chooses to stay in an unhappy relationship because they overestimate how devastated they would feel if they ended it.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies impact bias as the tendency to exaggerate/overestimate emotional effects of events, which matches the answer key's definition.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that impact bias prevents breakups because people overestimate how devastated/bad they would feel after ending the relationship.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting refers to a person's prediction of how they will feel in a future situation. Frequently, individuals assume they would prefer death over living with a disability. However, those who actually experience such circumstances often feel differently, a phenomenon known as the disability paradox. As a result, it is important to be cautious when making end-of-life decisions too early.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines affective forecasting as predictions about future emotional states, specifically how one will feel in future situations.
- Correct: The student accurately captures the core concept that healthy people predict they would prefer death when sick/disabled, but those who actually experience these conditions often feel differently, demonstrating understanding of the discrepancy between predicted and actual preferences.

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

People tend to overvalue small probabilities such as 10 percent, while perceiving extremely low probabilities like 0.01 percent as impossible and consequently underestimate them.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people overvalue/overestimate small probabilities like 10%, which aligns with the answer key point about merely low probabilities being overestimated.
- Correct: The student accurately describes that extremely low probabilities like 0.01% are perceived as impossible and consequently underestimated, which matches the answer key point about extremely low probabilities being interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

The prevention of unfavorable outcomes.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's answer describes risk aversion or general loss prevention, but does not address the key concept that loss aversion reflects the asymmetric weighting of negative vs positive utilities, or that the value function is steeper for losses than gains.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value deals only with numerical and monetary outcomes, while expected utility encompasses more than just money, incorporating other subjective forms of value. It also considers the impact of loss aversion.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory deals with numerical/monetary outcomes while expected utility theory encompasses broader, subjective forms of value beyond just money.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected utility theory considers psychological factors (loss aversion) while expected value theory does not, which aligns with the answer key's point about risk aversion and heuristics/biases.

Score: 1.0

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesnâ€™t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected value theory involves assessing potential monetary outcomes, such as a 0.3 probability of winning 30 euros and a 0.7 probability of winning 70 euros, resulting in an expected value of 20 euros. Expected utility theory builds on this idea by incorporating non-financial factors and risk aversion. Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT) extends expected utility theory by including multiple attributes to represent various utilities. Prospect theory also stems from expected utility theory but incorporates biases and heuristics, making it a descriptive model, whereas the others are normative models.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as dealing with monetary outcomes and probabilities, providing a clear numerical example that demonstrates understanding of the concept.
- Correct: The student accurately describes expected utility theory as building on expected value theory but incorporating non-financial factors and risk aversion, showing understanding of the key difference from purely monetary outcomes.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies MAUT as involving multiple attributes with various utilities, demonstrating understanding of the multi-attribute nature of this model.
- Correct: The student accurately describes prospect theory as incorporating biases and heuristics and correctly identifies it as a descriptive model in contrast to the normative nature of the other models.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease peopleâ€™s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

People tend to feel losses more intensely than gains and try to avoid them whenever possible. For example, if there's a scenario where someone could lose 50 euros half the time and win 70 euros the other half, the expected value is 20 euros. However, if given a choice between this and simply receiving 10 euros for sure, most people would opt for the guaranteed 10 euros, preferring to avoid risk despite the higher expected value in the first option, demonstrating risk aversion. Conversely, when a loss is guaranteedâ€”such as either losing a small amount for certain or facing the possibility of a larger loss or no loss at allâ€”people are more likely to take the riskier option, showing risk-seeking behavior.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly explains that loss aversion can make people risk-seeking when faced with potential losses. They provide a clear example showing that when a loss is guaranteed, people prefer the risky option that might avoid the loss entirely, even if it could result in a larger loss. This demonstrates understanding that loss aversion decreases risk aversion and can lead to risk-seeking behavior in the loss domain.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves learning through the association of events. Classical conditioning occurs when one event closely follows another, while operant conditioning involves learning through consequences such as rewards and punishments.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as learning through association of events, which aligns with the answer key's definition of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as occurring when one event closely follows another, which captures the essence of learning associations when things happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning through consequences such as rewards and punishments, which matches the answer key's description of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation is the mistaken belief that one event causes another, while illusory correlation is the incorrect assumption that two things are connected.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that illusory causation involves mistakenly believing one event causes another (causal relationship error) and that illusory correlation involves incorrectly assuming two things are connected when they aren't actually correlated. This captures the essential distinction between incorrectly inferring causation versus incorrectly perceiving correlation.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to â€˜properlyâ€™ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

Acting appropriately at a birthday party is considered a script because it is a familiar cultural event that follows a specific sequence of actions. The healthcare system, on the other hand, is a schema; it is less commonly experienced culturally and does not function as a script unless one has a chronic illness.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that understanding the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, though their reasoning focuses on frequency of experience rather than the key distinction that schemas represent knowledge structures and relationships between concepts.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that behaving at a birthday party is a script and provides appropriate reasoning that it involves a sequence of actions in a familiar cultural event, which aligns with the concept of scripts as behavioral sequences for specific situations.

Score: 1.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

This represents a functional perspective since behaviorists do not consider behavior to be driven by intention. Additionally, the physical characteristics of the behavior, such as biomechanics, are not taken into account. Instead, they concentrate solely on the functional aspect that connects the trigger to the response.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the functional stance instead of the physical stance. While they correctly note that behaviorists don't consider intentions, they misunderstand that behaviorists focus on the causal physical processes (stimulus-response mechanisms) rather than functional relationships, which would involve purposes or goals.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

This is a functional perspective because it addresses a specific purpose without focusing on intention, nor does it relate to mechanical or physical elements in that way.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly identifies that evolutionary psychology takes a functional perspective, but fails to specifically identify this as the 'design stance' from Dennett's framework. While they mention it addresses purpose without intention, they don't clearly connect this to Dennett's design stance terminology or provide the key insight that evolutionary psychologists consider psychological processes in terms of their adaptive function.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Are A and B occurring close together in time or location? Could A potentially lead to B? Is A responsible for influencing B? Are A and B connected in some way?

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions location and time proximity but doesn't identify this as 'distinctness' or 'specificity' - the concept that B follows A but not other events.
- Incorrect: The student doesn't mention consistency - that B always follows A when A occurs.
- Correct: The question 'Could A potentially lead to B?' captures the essence of plausibility - whether it makes common sense that A could cause B.
- Correct: The question about A and B occurring close together in time or location directly addresses contiguity in time and space.
- Incorrect: The student doesn't mention similarity between cause and effect - whether A and B superficially resemble each other.

Score: 0.4

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Firstly, the negativity bias causes us to focus on emotionally upsetting content, such as moral outrage. Moreover, the availability heuristic, which means we judge things based on how easily they come to mind, amplifies this effect because negative emotions stand out more. This results in an exaggerated perception of how many people are expressing moral outrage on social media.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias and explains it as focusing on emotionally upsetting content like moral outrage, which aligns with the answer key's definition of seeking out or placing more weight on negative information.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies availability heuristic and provides an accurate definition as judging things based on how easily they come to mind, which matches the answer key's explanation of estimating frequency based on ease of recall.
- Correct: The student successfully explains the interaction between the two biases, showing how negativity bias makes negative content stand out more, which then feeds into availability heuristic to create overestimation of moral outrage frequency, demonstrating the causal relationship described in the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

Framework theories are simple, intuitive understandings of how the world works. If you have a strong aversion to a person, that dislike can transfer to something that belongs to them. As a result, the object is seen as tainted or negatively influenced because of its association with the disliked individual.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly describes the phenomenon but fails to explain it in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge. The answer does not mention that this involves the incorrect application of biological contagion concepts to the social/psychological domain, which is the key theoretical explanation requested.

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A conspiracy theory asserts that those in authority are involved in a secret plan against ordinary individuals. Delusional conspiracy theories stem from premises that are not accepted by society. In contrast, non-delusional conspiracy theories, while they may be incorrect, are founded on ideas that are generally accepted socially.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that delusional conspiracy theories are based on premises not accepted by society, while non-delusional ones are founded on socially accepted ideas. This captures the key distinction about social acceptance, though the student doesn't explicitly mention the irrationality component.

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

Being male, having a lower socioeconomic background, and exhibiting narcissistic traits.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identified 'being a man' as one of the cognitive/personality factors contributing to conspiratorial thinking, which matches the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identified 'being narcissistic' as one of the factors, which directly corresponds to the answer key requirement.
- Incorrect: The student mentioned 'having a lower socioeconomic background' which is not listed among the cognitive and personality factors in the answer key. The answer key focuses on cognitive patterns and personality traits rather than socioeconomic factors.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you donâ€™t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Incorrect responses exert a lasting impact, which complicates the acceptance and assimilation of the new answers.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student provides a vague description of interference but fails to identify the specific psychological mechanism. The answer key requires naming source amnesia, proactive interference, or the continued-influence effect, none of which are mentioned in the student's response.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

Another example is the mere exposure effect, where we are more likely to favor and agree with things that we frequently encounter.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the mere exposure effect as the psychological mechanism by which repeated exposure to statements makes them more attractive or favorable, which directly answers the question.

Score: 1.0

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

MDD represents one extreme on the spectrum when assessing predictions for positive or negative outcomes, with a strong emphasis on the negative aspect. As a result, it is less accurate since it pays less attention to the positive side.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that MDD makes people less accurate at predictions due to overemphasis on negative outcomes. The answer key indicates that people with MDD are actually MORE accurate because they show reduced optimism bias, not less accurate due to negativity bias.

Score: 0.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

We depend more on the impact of our prior beliefs, making heuristics or biases more likely to have a stronger effect.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that prior beliefs have increased influence when sensory information is unreliable, and appropriately connects this to heuristics and biases having stronger effects, which aligns with the core concept in the answer key.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You donâ€™t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other peopleâ€™s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

The initial stage is known as pre-conventional, where moral choices are made based on personal outcomes of good or bad, with minimal consideration for others. The second stage, conventional, involves making moral decisions based on how others, including society, will judge you, aiming to maintain a positive image. The final stage, post-conventional, is characterized by an understanding that moral principles can sometimes be in conflict.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the pre-conventional level as focusing on personal outcomes (good or bad), which aligns with the answer key's description of avoiding punishment or gaining rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as making decisions based on how others and society will judge you, which corresponds to focusing on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Incorrect: The student's description of post-conventional level as 'understanding that moral principles can sometimes be in conflict' is incomplete and doesn't capture the key aspect of focusing on abstract principles and values as the basis for moral reasoning.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

It explains that we instinctively attempt to build a causal explanation for events that occurred. This leads to hindsight bias by creating the false impression that we originally knew or could have predicted the outcome, as we develop a causal model to make sense of the situation.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a causal model involves building explanations for how events are connected, though they describe it as 'instinctive attempts to build causal explanations' rather than explicitly calling it a 'coherent narrative of related events.'
- Correct: The student accurately explains how causal models contribute to hindsight bias by creating a false impression that outcomes were predictable or known beforehand, which aligns with the concept that events seem more inevitable than they actually were.

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

It is challenging to ignore information we have about an outcome once it has occurred, which supports the notion that we could have predicted it from the start.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that newly learned information (about outcomes) cannot be ignored when making retrospective judgments, which is the core mechanism of how learning contributes to hindsight bias. The answer captures the essence that once we know an outcome, this knowledge influences our assessment of how predictable it was.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Satisficing involves choosing an option that is sufficiently good, while maximizing involves seeking the absolute best choice. Maximizing is linked to neuroticism because individuals with this trait often have perfectionistic tendencies and feel anxious since they are unsure if they have made the optimal decision.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as seeking the absolute best choice, which aligns with the answer key's definition of 'trying to make the best choice.'
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as choosing an option that is sufficiently good, which matches the answer key's definition of 'making a good-enough choice.'
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that maximizing is linked to neuroticism and provides sound reasoning about perfectionistic tendencies and anxiety, demonstrating understanding of why neurotic individuals adopt the maximizing decision style.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

You can encourage students by having them specify who was responsible for each part in a group assignment that received a pass or fail grade.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The answer is too brief and superficial. While it mentions a specific technique (specifying responsibility in group work), it doesn't demonstrate serious engagement with the broader question of how to encourage active engagement with limited resources. The response lacks depth, doesn't connect to course knowledge, and doesn't address the core challenge of balancing student engagement with resource constraints.
