## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidtâ€™s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

System 1 refers to the moral judgments linked to intuition and gut feelings, driven by our emotions. In contrast, System 2 involves moral reasoning, where deliberate and thoughtful consideration determines what is moral. The social-intuitionist model primarily emphasizes the role of System 1.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies System 1 thinking as involving intuition and emotions ('gut feelings, driven by our emotions'), which matches the answer key requirement for System 1 being about intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student accurately describes System 2 as involving 'moral reasoning' and 'deliberate and thoughtful consideration,' which aligns with the answer key's requirement for System 2 being about reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student states that 'The social-intuitionist model primarily emphasizes the role of System 1,' which correctly indicates that System 1 (intuition/emotion) is more dominant than System 2, satisfying the answer key requirement.

Score: 1.0

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

Representativeness heuristic refers to the tendency to evaluate the likelihood of an event by how closely it resembles a typical example. In this case, since the colleague fits the image of a model, we are more inclined to believe they are a model.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process in this scenario.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that the representativeness heuristic involves estimating likelihood based on similarity to a typical example/stereotype, which matches the answer key's explanation about resembling the stereotype of a fashion model.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring involves forming an initial judgment or estimate, which is then modified as new information becomes available. The primacy effect refers to the tendency for the first information received to strongly influence the way subsequent information is perceived and understood. Both concepts share the idea that the initial information plays a crucial role, acting as the foundation for the first judgment or evaluation.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as forming an initial judgment that serves as a starting point, which aligns with the answer key's definition of taking the first piece of information as the starting point.
- Incorrect: The student describes the primacy effect as influencing how subsequent information is perceived, but misses the key aspect from the answer key that it specifically relates to better remembering the first piece of information.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both concepts share the common element of initial information playing a crucial foundational role, which matches the answer key's point about overreliance on first information.

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion means giving greater importance to losses than to gains, causing us to feel losses more intensely than gains. Risk aversion, on the other hand, refers to the tendency to steer clear of risky situations. In summary, loss aversion focuses on avoiding losses, while risk aversion centers on avoiding risk.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly explains that loss aversion means giving greater importance to losses than to gains and feeling losses more intensely, which aligns with the answer key's definition of weighing losses more heavily than gains.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies risk aversion as the tendency to steer clear of risky situations, which matches the answer key's definition of preferring certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 1.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias refers to our tendency to exaggerate the intensity of our future emotions. When going through a breakup, individuals may anticipate feeling worse than they actually will because they overestimate the negative impact of losing a partner. This exaggerated expectation can discourage them from ending the relationship.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as the tendency to exaggerate the intensity of future emotions, which aligns with overestimating the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that people may avoid breaking up because they overestimate how bad they will feel, anticipating worse emotions than they would actually experience.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves anticipating our future emotional responses. We often overestimate the intensity and duration of these feelings (impact bias) and tend to assume our future emotions will resemble our current mindset (projection bias). Consequently, when making end-of-life decisions, we base our judgments on our present state rather than accurately predicting our future feelings. This highlights the importance of taking affective forecasting into account during such decisions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines affective forecasting as predicting future emotional responses/states, which matches the answer key's definition of 'predictions about our own future emotional state.'
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of the key concept by explaining that we make end-of-life decisions based on current state rather than accurate future predictions, which aligns with the answer key's point about healthy people predicting they'd prefer to die when sick but potentially feeling differently when actually sick.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

People tend to overestimate small probabilities, although extremely small probabilities are overestimated to a lesser extent than moderately low probabilities.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people overestimate small/low probabilities, which aligns with the answer key's first point about merely low probabilities being overestimated.
- Incorrect: The student states that extremely small probabilities are 'overestimated to a lesser extent' rather than being treated as impossibilities. This misses the key insight that extremely low probabilities are often ignored or treated as zero probability events.

Score: 0.5

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion means we feel the pain of losses more strongly than the pleasure of gains. This causes us to give greater importance to losses. As a result, the expected negative impact of losses outweighs the expected positive impact of gains.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly captures that loss aversion means losses are weighted more heavily than gains, explaining this through the psychological mechanism of feeling losses more strongly than gains. While they don't use the technical term 'utility' or mention the steepness of the value function, they demonstrate understanding of the core concept that negative outcomes have disproportionate impact compared to positive ones.

Score: 1.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected utility theory accounts for risk aversion, while expected value theory does not. Additionally, expected value theory focuses solely on financial results, whereas expected utility theory takes into account both financial and non-financial outcomes.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory deals only with financial values while expected utility theory also considers non-financial values/outcomes.
- Correct: The student accurately states that expected utility theory accounts for risk aversion while expected value theory does not, which aligns with the answer key's point about heuristics and biases consideration.

Score: 1.0

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesnâ€™t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

1. Expected value theory is a normative decision-making model where choices are made by computing the expected value. 2. Expected utility theory is a normative framework that involves calculating expected utility while factoring in risk aversion. 3. Multi-attribute utility theory is a normative model that evaluates decisions based on multiple attributes. 4. Prospect theory is a descriptive model that incorporates heuristics and biases, addressing both risk aversion and loss aversion.

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies expected value theory as a normative model involving computation of expected value, which aligns with the key concept of choosing between options with probabilistic financial outcomes.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies expected utility theory as a normative framework calculating expected utility and mentions risk aversion, which captures the essence of utility beyond just financial outcomes.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies multi-attribute utility theory as a normative model evaluating decisions based on multiple attributes, which matches the key point about options having multiple attributes with utilities and weights.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies prospect theory as a descriptive model incorporating heuristics and biases, and specifically mentions both risk aversion and loss aversion, which aligns with the behavioral nature described in the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease peopleâ€™s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

We feel losses more intensely than gains. When risks involve more losses than gains, we usually try to avoid them. On the other hand, when risks are presented as potential losses, we are more likely to take risks.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when risks are framed as potential losses, people become more willing to take risks, which demonstrates understanding that loss aversion can make people risk-seeking rather than risk-averse in loss domains.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves forming a connection between two things. In classical conditioning, this happens by linking two stimuli so that when one appears, the other is also experienced. Operant conditioning uses reinforcements (either positive or negative) or punishments. For instance, associating a stimulus with a positive reinforcement increases the likelihood of a specific behavior being repeated.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that conditioning involves forming connections/associations between things, which aligns with the answer key's definition of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as linking two stimuli so that one predicts the other, which matches the answer key's explanation of learning associations when things happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning involves reinforcements and punishments that affect behavior likelihood, which aligns with the answer key's description of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

The distinction is that with illusory causation, we mistakenly believe that one event causes another, perceiving a cause-and-effect link that doesn't actually exist. In contrast, illusory correlation occurs when we incorrectly assume two variables are related or change together, even though no such connection exists.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that illusory causation involves mistakenly perceiving a causal relationship where none exists, and illusory correlation involves incorrectly perceiving a relationship/connection between variables that don't actually correlate. The explanation captures the key distinction between these two concepts.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to â€˜properlyâ€™ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

The Dutch healthcare system is an example of a schema, while appropriate conduct at a birthday party is an example of a script. The healthcare system qualifies as a schema because it represents a broad framework of general information. In contrast, birthday party behavior is considered a script because it reflects our understanding of the sequence of events in specific situations.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the healthcare system as a schema and provides a valid explanation that it represents a 'broad framework of general information,' which aligns with the answer key's emphasis on knowledge and relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies birthday party behavior as a script and provides an appropriate explanation that it reflects 'understanding of the sequence of events in specific situations,' which corresponds to the answer key's definition of scripts as social schemas for specific situational behavior.

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

The intentional stance is the most suitable because it explains behavior based on intentions, which aligns more closely with how people act.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the intentional stance as the behaviorist approach. Behaviorists explicitly rejected mental states like intentions and focused on observable stimulus-response relationships, which corresponds to the physical stance, not the intentional stance.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

They use a functional, or design, perspective because this type of analysis helps explain the world by focusing on functionsâ€”understanding how and why things operate the way they do. Here, it involves examining the role of ingroup favoritism.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance (mentioned as 'functional, or design, perspective') and provides an accurate rationale that this approach focuses on functions and understanding how/why psychological processes operate, which aligns with the answer key's explanation about considering processes in terms of their function.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

1. Uniqueness; words show up on the screen when I press the keyboard keys, not because someone entered the room. 2. Specificity; the bike accident happened because you collided with a car while riding, not simply because you were alive. 3. Closeness in time and place; when I scratch my cat, it purrs since these actions occur near each other in both time and location. 4. Sequence; I scratch my cat first, and then it purrs, not the reverse. 5. Similarity in cause and effect; when I kick a ball, the motion of my leg resembles the way the ball rolls.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the concept of distinctness/specificity with 'uniqueness' and 'specificity', providing appropriate examples showing that B follows A but not other events.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention consistency (B always follows A). Instead, they describe specificity again with a different example.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention plausibility (common sense making causation believable). The 'closeness in time and place' refers to contiguity, not plausibility.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies contiguity in time and space with 'closeness in time and place' and provides an appropriate example.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies similarity in cause and effect, providing an example where the leg motion resembles the ball's rolling motion.

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

The availability heuristic is a mental shortcut where we estimate how often events occur based on how quickly they come to mind. Negativity bias refers to our tendency to focus on negative emotional information. These two biases interact because negative emotional content is remembered more readily due to our preference for it. As a result, we tend to overestimate how common morally outraged individuals are.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias as our tendency to focus on negative information, which aligns with the answer key's definition of seeking out or placing more weight on negative information like morally outraged content.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the availability heuristic as estimating frequency based on how quickly examples come to mind, which matches the answer key's definition of estimating frequency based on ease of recall.
- Correct: The student explains the interaction between the biases correctly - negativity bias makes negative content more memorable/readily recalled, which through availability heuristic leads to overestimating moral outrage frequency, demonstrating understanding of the causal relationship.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

Framework theories represent our understanding of the three areas: physics, psychology, and biology. Magical effects arise when we take knowledge from one domain and apply it to another. Thus, we rely on a different domain of knowledge to assess this contagion.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that magical contagion involves applying knowledge from one domain (biology) to another domain (psychology/social), which matches the key concept that biological contagion is incorrectly applied to the social/psychological domain.

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

Delusions are unreasonable beliefs that are not accepted by society. Therefore, a delusional conspiracy theory differs from a non-delusional one because it is not embraced or accepted within the culture.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student only identifies one criterion (lack of social acceptance) but misses the equally important criterion that the belief must be irrational. The answer key requires both conditions: the conspiracy theory must be an irrational belief AND not commonly accepted to be considered delusional.

Score: 0.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

1. self-centered 2. finding order in chaos 3. embracing straightforward reasons for complicated situations

Feedback:

- Correct: Self-centered corresponds to narcissistic personality trait mentioned in the answer key.
- Correct: Finding order in chaos accurately describes seeing patterns in randomness from the answer key.
- Correct: Embracing straightforward reasons for complicated situations matches believing in simple explanations for complex events from the answer key.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you donâ€™t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Hindsight bias occurs because its widespread presence prevents us from learning from previous experiences, leaving us unprepared for unexpected situations. When we look back and say "I knew it all along," it's because the outcome now appears obvious and understandable. This tendency can hinder our ability to learn effectively.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes hindsight bias, which is about retrospectively believing you knew an outcome all along. However, the question asks about how incorrect answers during self-quizzing interfere with learning. The answer key requires explanation of source amnesia (forgetting that your answer was incorrect) or proactive interference (initial incorrect answers interfering with correct ones). Hindsight bias is not the relevant mechanism for this specific scenario.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

Conditioning involves creating a connection between different stimuli.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes conditioning, which is about stimulus-response associations, but does not identify the correct mechanism. The answer key requires mere exposure effect (preference for familiar things) or illusory-truth effect, neither of which the student mentions.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Yes, it reduces their accuracy in making those predictions. Having unrealistic optimism is actually an indicator of good health.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that major depressive disorder reduces accuracy in predictions, when research shows that depressed individuals are actually more accurate due to reduced optimistic bias. The student also misses that unrealistic optimism, while potentially beneficial for mental health, actually reduces predictive accuracy.

Score: 0.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

When sensory information becomes less reliable, it influences our prior beliefs to a lesser extent. According to Bayesian statistics, our posterior belief is a weighted combination of prior knowledge and new evidence. When the evidence is uncertain, the prior knowledge plays a stronger role in shaping the posterior belief than the evidence does.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that unreliable sensory information influences prior beliefs to a lesser extent, when the correct relationship is that prior beliefs have greater influence on perception when sensory information is unreliable. While they correctly mention Bayesian weighting, they fail to clearly state that prior beliefs become MORE influential on perception when sensory reliability decreases.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You donâ€™t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other peopleâ€™s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

The preconventional level involves making moral decisions to avoid punishment or obtain rewards. The conventional level relies on societal opinions and laws to maintain order. The postconventional level reflects a more profound and universal grasp of moral reasoning.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the pre-conventional level as making moral decisions to avoid punishment or obtain rewards, which matches the answer key's focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as relying on societal opinions and laws to maintain order, which aligns with the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the post-conventional level as reflecting a more profound and universal grasp of moral reasoning, which corresponds to the answer key's focus on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

The causal model of past events involves constructing a mental link that explains how specific events occurred. Once this link is formed, the result appears more unavoidable, which reinforces our tendency toward hindsight bias.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a causal model involves constructing mental links/explanations for how events occurred, which captures the essence of creating a coherent narrative of related past events.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that once the causal model is formed, results appear more unavoidable, which directly corresponds to the answer key's point about events seeming more inevitable and contributing to hindsight bias.

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Learning leads to hindsight bias because it is difficult to ignore information we have acquired when forming a judgment. This can be seen as a helpful learning mechanism, where we incorporate recent knowledge both in making decisions and recalling our original judgments.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that learning contributes to hindsight bias by making it difficult to ignore newly acquired information when estimating past judgments. The answer captures the core mechanism that newly learned information cannot be avoided when recalling previous likelihood estimates, which aligns with the answer key's main point.

Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing involves selecting the optimal choice, while satisficing means picking an option that meets acceptable criteria. Individuals with high levels of neuroticism tend to prefer a maximizing approach to decision-making.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as selecting the optimal choice, which aligns with the answer key's definition of 'trying to make the best choice.'
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as picking an option that meets acceptable criteria, which corresponds to the answer key's definition of 'making a good-enough choice.'
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that individuals with high neuroticism tend to prefer a maximizing approach, matching the answer key's statement about adopting the maximizing decision style.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

I would begin by incorporating an assignment that encourages interaction and requires applying the course material in a new context. This approach can deepen students' understanding by prompting them to think differently about the content. Allowing students to generate their own answers, such as through an open exam, could also be advantageous. Unlike multiple-choice tests, which may reinforce hindsight biasâ€”where material seems clear only after the fact without active engagementâ€”open exams promote better learning by encouraging active involvement. Additionally, in terms of risk perception, the way we present exams and assignments matters: framing tasks in terms of potential losses makes people more risk-seeking. Therefore, instead of saying "not doing this assignment will result in a poor grade," it's better to say "doing this assignment will improve your chances of a good grade."

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement with the question by providing specific, well-reasoned strategies that directly address the challenge of promoting active engagement with limited resources. They discuss interactive assignments, open exams vs. multiple-choice tests, and apply course concepts like hindsight bias and loss/gain framing to educational practice. The answer shows thoughtful consideration of both pedagogical approaches and psychological principles covered in the course.

Score: 1.0
