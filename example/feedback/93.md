Grade: 8.5

## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

The social-intuitionist model suggests that moral judgments primarily stem from intuition, with only a small role played by reasoning. System 1 involves quick, automatic, and effortless thought processes, while System 2 is characterized by slow, deliberate, and logical thinking. Thus, moral judgment mainly relies on System 1, with System 2 contributing to a lesser extent, making System 1 the dominant factor in this model.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 involves 'quick, automatic, and effortless thought processes' which aligns with the answer key's description of System 1 as intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student accurately describes System 2 as 'slow, deliberate, and logical thinking' which corresponds to the answer key's characterization of System 2 as reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student clearly states that 'moral judgment mainly relies on System 1' and that 'System 1 [is] the dominant factor in this model,' correctly identifying System 1 as more dominant than System 2.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

The representativeness heuristic is the tendency to estimate the likelihood that someone fits into a category based on how closely they appear to match our mental image of that category.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process in this scenario.
- Correct: The student accurately explains the representativeness heuristic as estimating likelihood of category membership based on resemblance to mental stereotypes, which matches the key concept in the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

The primacy effect refers to the tendency to recall initial information more easily than what comes afterward. Anchoring involves using the first piece of information received as a reference point for subsequent judgments or decisions. These concepts are related because the information remembered during the primacy effect often becomes the anchor, such as when forming impressions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as using the first piece of information as a reference point for subsequent judgments, which aligns with the answer key's definition of taking the first piece of information as the starting point.
- Correct: The student accurately defines the primacy effect as the tendency to recall initial information more easily than what comes afterward, which matches the answer key's description of better remembering the first piece of information.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the connection between the two concepts, explaining that primacy effect information often becomes the anchor, which demonstrates understanding of their shared overreliance on first information.

Score: 1.0

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion relates to utility, while risk aversion pertains to probability.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly describes loss aversion as relating to utility rather than explaining that it refers to weighing losses more heavily than equivalent gains.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly describes risk aversion as pertaining to probability rather than explaining that it refers to preferring certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 0.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate how much future events will affect our emotional well-being. Those experiencing this bias often assume that a breakup will cause greater future unhappiness than it truly will, which can stop them from ending the relationship.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as overestimating how future events will affect emotional well-being, which matches the answer key's definition of overestimating the impact of future events on future feelings.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that impact bias prevents breakups because people overestimate the unhappiness a breakup will cause, which aligns with the answer key's explanation about overestimating how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves anticipating how you will feel in the future based on upcoming events. When making end-of-life choices while healthy, people often believe they would prefer death over illness or disability. Yet, once they become sick or disabled, this perspective often changes.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies affective forecasting as predicting future emotional states, though they phrase it as 'anticipating how you will feel' rather than specifically mentioning predictions about one's own emotional state.
- Correct: The student accurately captures the key insight that healthy people predict they would prefer death when sick, but their actual preferences change once they become ill or disabled, demonstrating understanding of the forecasting error.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

According to prospect theory, individuals often overvalue small probabilities. However, there is a distinction between moderately low probabilities and extremely low probabilities: moderately low probabilities are overestimated, while extremely low probabilities are perceived as impossible.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that moderately low probabilities are overestimated, which aligns with the answer key's point about merely low probabilities being overestimated.
- Correct: The student accurately states that extremely low probabilities are perceived as impossible, which matches the answer key's point about extremely low probabilities being interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion means that individuals tend to place greater importance on losses than on equivalent gains.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves placing greater importance/weight on losses compared to equivalent gains, which captures the core concept that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities in prospect theory.

Score: 1.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

The two primary distinctions between expected value theory and expected utility theory are that expected utility theory takes into account non-monetary outcomes and an individual's aversion to risk.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected utility theory considers non-monetary outcomes, which aligns with the answer key point about expected utility dealing with non-financial values while expected value theory deals only with financial values.
- Correct: The student correctly mentions that expected utility theory accounts for risk aversion, which matches the answer key point about expected utility theory considering risk aversion while expected value theory does not consider heuristics and biases.

Score: 1.0

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

The four models of choice, value, and utility include expected value theory, expected utility theory, multi-attribute utility theory, and prospect theory. Expected value theory is a normative, finance-based model aimed at identifying the optimal decision. Expected utility theory is also normative and similar to expected value theory but incorporates risk aversion and factors beyond financial outcomes. Multi-attribute utility theory resembles expected value theory but takes into account multiple attributes for each option. Finally, prospect theory is a descriptive model that builds on expected utility theory by incorporating heuristics and biases.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as a normative model and mentions it's finance-based for optimal decision making, which aligns with the key point about financial outcomes and probabilities.
- Correct: The student accurately describes expected utility theory as normative and similar to expected value theory but incorporating non-financial factors (risk aversion), which matches the answer key's emphasis on subjective utility beyond financial outcomes.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies multi-attribute utility theory as considering multiple attributes for each option, which captures the essence of the answer key's description of multiple attributes with utilities and weights.
- Correct: The student accurately describes prospect theory as a descriptive model that builds on expected utility theory by incorporating heuristics and biases, which perfectly matches the answer key's characterization.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

When you are loss averse, you place greater importance on losses than on gains. This causes you to be more cautious, favoring situations with a low probability of loss rather than risky ones with a higher likelihood of losing.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that loss aversion makes people more cautious and risk averse. The answer key indicates that loss aversion actually decreases risk aversion and can make people risk seeking when trying to avoid losses, which is the opposite of what the student described.

Score: 0.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves connecting two events that typically occur at the same time. Classical conditioning occurs when a neutral stimulus becomes linked to a conditioned stimulus, such as associating a bell with food. Operant conditioning happens when you understand that a specific action results in a reward or a punishment.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as connecting/linking events that occur together, which aligns with learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as linking stimuli that occur together (bell with food example), demonstrating understanding of temporal/spatial association.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as understanding that actions lead to rewards or punishments, matching the key concept of learning action-consequence relationships.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation occurs when we mistakenly interpret a correlation as a cause-and-effect relationship. Illusory correlation refers to perceiving a false connection between two variables, such as believing a certain medication causes improvement in depression patients when it may not.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that illusory causation involves mistakenly interpreting correlation as causation, and that illusory correlation involves perceiving a false connection between variables that aren't actually correlated. The example about medication and depression demonstrates understanding of illusory correlation as perceiving correlation where none exists.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

The Dutch healthcare system functions as an example of a schema, while the appropriate behavior at a birthday party represents a script. A schema serves as a general framework, whereas a script is a more detailed type of schema that outlines expected behavior in typical situations. Here, it illustrates the expected conduct at a birthday party.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the Dutch healthcare system as a schema and provides appropriate reasoning that it serves as a general framework, which aligns with the answer key's explanation about knowledge and relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies birthday party behavior as a script and provides good reasoning that it's a detailed type of schema outlining expected behavior in typical situations, which matches the answer key's explanation about social schemas for specific situations.

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

Behaviorists take an intentional perspective because they focus on both individuals' thoughts and actions.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies behaviorists as taking an intentional stance and claims they focus on thoughts, when behaviorists explicitly rejected studying mental states and thoughts as unmeasurable, instead adopting a physical stance by focusing only on observable stimulus-response relationships.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

They adopt the design stance because evolutionary psychologists concentrate on the purpose of an entity.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the design stance and provides an accurate rationale - focusing on 'purpose of an entity' aligns with the answer key's emphasis on considering psychological processes 'in terms of their function.'

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

To determine if event A causes event B, we consider: 1. consistency: event B occurs when A happens and does not occur when A is absent; 2. distinctiveness: event B is rarely caused by other factors; 3. plausibility: based on what we know, it makes sense that A could cause B; 4. temporal and spatial proximity: event B follows immediately after event A, and for example, if event B is a cat purring and event A is scratching, the effect would only occur in the same cat being scratched; 5. similarity in cause and effect: for instance, moving your leg to kick a ball (event A) will result in the ball moving (event B).

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies distinctiveness and explains it as event B being rarely caused by other factors, which aligns with the answer key's concept that B follows A but not other events.
- Correct: The student accurately describes consistency as event B occurring when A happens and not occurring when A is absent, which matches the answer key's definition that B always follows A.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies plausibility and explains it as making sense that A could cause B based on what we know, which aligns with the answer key's common sense criterion.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies temporal and spatial proximity, explaining that B follows immediately after A and providing a relevant example of the cat purring/scratching scenario to illustrate spatial contiguity.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies similarity in cause and effect and provides a good example with kicking a ball resulting in the ball moving, demonstrating understanding of superficial resemblance between cause and effect.

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

The overestimation of how many people are morally outraged is mainly due to two biases: the availability heuristic and negativity bias. Negativity bias leads us to focus more on negative events, such as moral outrage, and when combined with the availability heuristic, it creates the impression that moral outrage happens more frequently than it actually does. This happens because the availability heuristic estimates the probability of an event based on how readily it can be recalled.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias and explains it as the tendency to focus more on negative events, which aligns with the answer key's description of seeking out or placing more weight on negative information.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the availability heuristic and accurately describes it as estimating probability based on how readily examples can be recalled, which matches the answer key's definition.
- Correct: The student successfully explains how these biases work together - negativity bias causes focus on moral outrage content, which through the availability heuristic leads to overestimating its frequency, demonstrating understanding of the causal relationship.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

We rely on framework theories to understand the world by drawing on shared concepts from various fields such as biology, social behavior, and nature. When concepts from social interactions are applied to the realm of nature, it results in superstitions. In this scenario, applying the social interaction idea to nature leads to the belief that a person's essence can be transferred or rubbed off onto someone else.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the direction of conceptual transfer - they claim social concepts are applied to nature, but the answer key requires recognizing that biological contagion concepts are incorrectly applied to the social domain. The student has the framework theory mechanism right but gets the domains backwards.

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A non-delusional conspiracy theory is generally accepted and believed by many, while a delusional conspiracy theory is not.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student only identifies one criterion (common acceptance) but misses the key distinction that delusional conspiracy theories must be both irrational beliefs AND not commonly accepted. The answer fails to mention the irrationality component, which is essential to the definition.

Score: 0.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

Three elements that lead to conspiratorial thinking include having narcissistic traits, desiring straightforward explanations for complicated issues, and the inclination to find patterns in various events.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies narcissistic traits as a factor contributing to conspiratorial thinking, which matches 'being narcissistic' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student mentions 'desiring straightforward explanations for complicated issues' which corresponds to 'believing in simple explanations for complex events' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student identifies 'inclination to find patterns in various events' which aligns with 'seeing patterns in randomness' from the answer key.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Incorrect answers can affect your response because of belief persistence. Belief persistence means that beliefs continue to impact your answers even after they have been disproven by new information. This occurs because beliefs are held in system 1, while revising your opinions takes place in system 2.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes belief persistence and dual-process theory (System 1/System 2) but doesn't address the specific mechanism asked about. The answer key requires explanation of source amnesia (forgetting that an incorrect answer was wrong) or proactive interference (initial incorrect answers interfering with correct ones). Belief persistence is a related but different concept that doesn't specifically explain how quiz-generated incorrect answers interfere with learning the correct material.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

The mere exposure bias refers to the tendency to develop a preference for something simply because you have encountered it repeatedly.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the mere exposure effect/bias as the psychological mechanism, accurately describing it as developing preferences through repeated encounters, which matches the answer key's explanation of preferring familiar things.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Certainly. Individuals with Major Depressive Disorder exhibit a reduced positivity bias, leading them to expect fewer positive outcomes. As a result, they tend to underestimate the likelihood of positive events occurring.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student discusses reduced positivity bias and underestimating positive events, but fails to address the key point about accuracy in predicting negative events. The answer key specifically requires explaining that depressed individuals are MORE accurate at predictions due to reduced overly optimistic tendencies, which the student does not mention.

Score: 0.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

When sensory information becomes less reliable, prior beliefs have a greater influence, causing perception to align more closely with those prior beliefs.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when sensory information becomes less reliable, prior beliefs have greater influence on perception, which directly matches the key concept from the answer key.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

The three stages of moral development are preconventional, conventional, and postconventional. The preconventional stage involves avoiding punishment and seeking rewards, as well as acting in ways that benefit oneself. The conventional stage centers on maintaining interpersonal relationships and conforming to the expectations of authority figures. The postconventional stage recognizes that moral principles can conflict and emphasizes broader, universal ethical values.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the pre-conventional level as involving avoiding punishment and seeking rewards, which matches the answer key's focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as centering on maintaining interpersonal relationships and conforming to authority expectations, which aligns with the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly describes the post-conventional level as emphasizing broader, universal ethical values and recognizing conflicts between moral principles, which matches the answer key's focus on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model fuels hindsight bias by prompting us to link the decision directly to the outcome. This creates a narrative focused on what did occur rather than on alternative possibilities that did not come to pass. As a result, it becomes simpler to concentrate on the actual events, which reinforces hindsight bias.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a causal model creates a narrative linking events, which aligns with the concept of a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student accurately explains how causal models contribute to hindsight bias by making actual events seem more prominent while diminishing consideration of alternative possibilities, which corresponds to making events seem more inevitable than they were.

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Learning leads to hindsight bias because when evaluating the probability of a past decision, you inevitably incorporate the knowledge you have gained since then.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that learning contributes to hindsight bias by explaining that newly acquired knowledge inevitably influences retrospective probability judgments, which directly matches the answer key's main point about being unable to avoid taking newly learned information into account when estimating past likelihood judgments.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing refers to the desire to select the best possible option, while satisficing involves choosing an option that is simply satisfactory. Individuals who score high in neuroticism are more likely to use a maximizing approach to decision-making.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as selecting the best possible option, which aligns with the answer key's definition of 'trying to make the best choice.'
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as choosing an option that is simply satisfactory, which matches the answer key's definition of 'making a good-enough choice.'
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that individuals high in neuroticism are more likely to use a maximizing approach, which directly matches the answer key.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

To encourage all students to actively participate with the content, I would utilize an AI model that engages in interactive conversations with them. For each chapter that needs to be reviewed for the test, I would implement a 'Chat GPT' style format where students answer a question and then immediately receive a new one, creating a dialogue similar to a teacher-student interaction. Additionally, I would consider employing Teaching Assistants (TAs) to offer personalized feedback and handle grading. To boost engagement during lectures, I would use live interactive online quizzes that students can answer on their phones, which helps shy students participate without feeling intimidated by the larger group. Furthermore, I would incorporate peer assessments on assignments to provide tailored feedback.
