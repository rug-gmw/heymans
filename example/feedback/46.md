## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidtâ€™s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

System 1 thinking is intuitive and driven by emotions, while System 2 thinking is logical and grounded in facts and reasoning. System 2 tends to be more dominant.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies System 1 thinking as intuitive and driven by emotions, which aligns with the answer key's description of System 1 as intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies System 2 thinking as logical and grounded in reasoning, which matches the answer key's description of System 2 as reasoning/rational thought.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that System 2 tends to be more dominant, when according to Haidt's social-intuitionist model, System 1 (intuition/emotion) is actually more dominant than System 2.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

Representative heuristic --> You make an assumption about something based on your perception that it fits within a certain group.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying concept, though they use 'representative' instead of 'representativeness' - this is a minor terminology variation that doesn't affect the core understanding.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of the heuristic by explaining that assumptions are made based on perceived fit within a group, which captures the essence of judging likelihood based on resemblance to stereotypes or categories.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring refers to the tendency to adjust your result based on the initial information you receive. The primacy effect means that the first thing you learn or observe is the most likely to be remembered. In both cases, the emphasis is on the initial information people encounter.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as being related to initial information, though describes it as 'adjusting your result' rather than using it as a 'starting point.' The core concept is captured.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as the tendency for the first thing learned or observed to be most likely remembered, which aligns with 'better remembering the first piece of information.'
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both phenomena emphasize initial information people encounter, which captures the essence of 'overreliance on the first piece of information.'

Score: 1.0

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency for individuals to consider losses as more significant than gains, while risk aversion is the preference to avoid taking risks.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves considering losses as more significant than gains, which matches the answer key's definition of weighing losses more heavily than gains.
- Incorrect: The student defines risk aversion as 'preference to avoid taking risks' which is too vague and doesn't capture the key concept from the answer key about preferring certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 0.5

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias refers to the tendency of individuals to overestimate how negatively they will feel about certain outcomes. In this situation, people believe they will be deeply heartbroken and upset if their relationship ends, even though they are already unhappy in the relationship.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies impact bias as overestimating how negatively they will feel about outcomes, which captures the essence of overestimating the impact of future events on feelings.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that impact bias prevents breakups because people overestimate how bad they'll feel (being 'deeply heartbroken and upset'), which matches the answer key's explanation.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting means making decisions about the future based on your current feelings. In end-of-life choices, you might decide now to opt for euthanasia if you can no longer tend to your garden, but when the time comes and you truly can't garden anymore, you might still want to live because you've discovered other sources of happiness.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly defines affective forecasting as 'making decisions about the future based on your current feelings' rather than the correct definition of 'predictions about our own future emotional state.'
- Correct: The student correctly illustrates the core concept that healthy people may predict they will prefer to die when they get sick, but when actually sick, they may not prefer to die, using a concrete example about gardening and finding other sources of happiness.

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

They tend to underestimate low probabilities, particularly those that are extremely small, as some individuals might claim the chance is zero, which is never true. However, people generally do not consider just low probabilities to be zero.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that people underestimate low probabilities, when prospect theory shows that merely low probabilities (like 10%) are typically overestimated.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that extremely low probabilities are often treated as impossibilities (interpreted as zero), which aligns with the answer key point about extremely low probabilities being interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 0.5

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency to give more importance to losses than to gains, meaning that in prospect theory, negative outcomes have a greater impact on your sense of utility than positive ones.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion means negative outcomes (losses) have greater impact on utility than positive ones (gains), which aligns with the answer key's explanation that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory focuses on monetary outcomes, while expected utility theory encompasses a wider range of considerations and includes a greater sensitivity to losses.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory focuses on monetary outcomes while expected utility theory encompasses a wider range of considerations, which aligns with the distinction between financial and non-financial values.
- Incorrect: While the student mentions 'greater sensitivity to losses' which relates to risk preferences, they do not explicitly mention risk aversion or the contrast with expected value theory's lack of consideration for heuristics and biases.

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesnâ€™t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Sure! Please provide the text you'd like me to rephrase.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student did not provide any explanation of expected value theory or mention it at all.
- Incorrect: The student did not provide any explanation of expected utility theory or mention it at all.
- Incorrect: The student did not provide any explanation of multi-attribute utility theory or mention it at all.
- Incorrect: The student did not provide any explanation of prospect theory or mention it at all.

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease peopleâ€™s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency for individuals to give greater importance to losses than to gains, so someone who is highly loss averse will also tend to avoid risk.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that loss aversion leads to risk avoidance. The answer key indicates that loss aversion actually decreases risk aversion and can make people risk-seeking when trying to avoid potential losses. The student misunderstands the relationship between loss aversion and risk preferences.

Score: 0.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning is a type of learning involving associations. In classical conditioning, you learn that one event predicts another (for example, the bell rings, so food will follow). In operant conditioning, you learn that a specific action will result in a positive or negative outcome.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as learning involving associations, which aligns with the answer key's definition of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as learning that one event predicts another, which captures the essence of learning associations when things happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning that actions result in positive or negative outcomes, which matches the answer key's description of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation is the mistaken belief that one event directly causes another, while illusory correlation is the false perception that there is a relationship between two events.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly distinguishes between illusory causation (mistaken belief in a causal relationship) and illusory correlation (false perception of a relationship/correlation between variables). The answer captures the essential difference that illusory causation involves incorrectly inferring causation while illusory correlation involves perceiving a correlation that doesn't actually exist.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to â€˜properlyâ€™ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

Schema: The Dutch healthcare system is established by the government, with little input from the public. Script: The way to act at a birthday party is shaped culturally by the Dutch people and is not governed by official regulations.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly focuses on how the healthcare system is established rather than explaining that it's a schema because it represents knowledge and relationships between concepts/things.
- Incorrect: The student correctly identifies birthday party behavior as a script but fails to explain that it's a script because it describes behavioral sequences for specific situations, instead focusing on cultural vs. official origins.

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

Sure, please provide the text you'd like me to rephrase.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student did not provide an answer to the question. They only asked for text to rephrase, which is completely unrelated to the behaviorism and Dennett's stances question.

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Availability heuristic: information that is easy to recall is more quickly linked in your mind. Representative heuristic:

Feedback:

- Incorrect: Student mentions 'availability heuristic' which is unrelated to causation heuristics. The answer key requires 'distinctness/specificity' - when B follows A but not other events.
- Incorrect: Student mentions 'representative heuristic' but doesn't complete the explanation and this is not one of the five causation heuristics. The answer key requires 'consistency' - when B always follows A.
- Incorrect: Student does not mention 'plausibility' heuristic - when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Incorrect: Student does not mention 'contiguity in time and space' heuristic - when A and B occur at the same time and location.
- Incorrect: Student does not mention 'similarity in cause and effect' heuristic - when A and B superficially resemble each other.

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Negativity bias means that people tend to pay more attention to negative aspects of something. Confirmation bias refers to the tendency of people to seek out information that supports their existing beliefs. On social media, unusual or negative content often gets highlighted and makes the headlines. Additionally, people rarely look for morally positive information, so they continue to encounter content that reinforces their current views.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias and provides an accurate definition, explaining that people pay more attention to negative aspects, which aligns with the answer key's explanation of seeking out or placing more weight on negative information like morally outraged content.
- Incorrect: The student identifies confirmation bias instead of the availability heuristic as the second bias. While confirmation bias is a real cognitive bias, it doesn't explain the mechanism of overestimating frequency based on ease of recall that the availability heuristic describes.
- Incorrect: The student doesn't clearly explain how the two biases work together to cause overestimation of moral outrage. They mention that negative content gets highlighted and people encounter reinforcing content, but don't connect this to the specific mechanism of overestimating frequency due to increased mental availability of examples.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

The underlying idea in this case is that using something belonging to a person you dislike will result in negative outcomes, as their energy is thought to pass on to you.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes the phenomenon but does not explain it in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge. The answer lacks any mention of biological contagion concepts being misapplied to social/psychological domains, which is the key theoretical framework needed to answer this question.

Score: 0.0

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A delusional conspiracy does not need to be grounded in facts, and when evidence disproves it, that evidence is examined rather than ignored; claims that such evidence is part of the theoryâ€”and therefore invalidâ€”are incorrect. In contrast, a non-delusional theory is supported by facts and evidence.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's answer focuses on evidence and factual grounding but misses the key distinction from the answer key. The answer key defines delusional conspiracy theories as those that are both irrational beliefs AND not commonly accepted, while non-delusional ones don't meet both criteria. The student doesn't address the 'commonly accepted' criterion at all and has some confusing language about evidence examination.

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

Your answer:

academic category, political viewpoint, and insular region

Feedback:

- Incorrect: Academic category is not mentioned in the answer key as a cognitive or personality factor contributing to conspiratorial thinking.
- Incorrect: Political viewpoint is not listed in the answer key as one of the specific cognitive or personality factors discussed in the lecture.
- Incorrect: Insular region is not mentioned in the answer key as a cognitive or personality factor contributing to conspiratorial thinking.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you donâ€™t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

The mental shortcut that relies on immediate examples that come to mind when evaluating a topic or decision.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes the availability heuristic, which is about using easily recalled examples for decision-making. This is completely unrelated to the question about how incorrect quiz answers can interfere with learning through mechanisms like source amnesia or proactive interference.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

recency bias

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student answered 'recency bias' which refers to giving more weight to recent information, but the correct answer is 'mere exposure effect' - the tendency to prefer familiar things through repeated exposure.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Yes, because they tend to concentrate more on the negative aspects than most people.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly answers 'Yes' when the correct answer is 'No'. While they mention focusing on negative aspects, they fail to understand that this actually makes depressed individuals MORE accurate at predicting negative outcomes, not less accurate, due to reduced optimistic bias.

Score: 0.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

The impact of prior beliefs becomes stronger because you have numerous memories of what something usually looks like, and when sensory information becomes less reliable, your brain automatically relies on these memories of how things typically appear. Therefore, when there is conflicting information, prior beliefs tend to dominate.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that prior beliefs become stronger/more influential when sensory information is less reliable. While they use different terminology (memories, brain automatically relies) and add mechanistic explanations not required by the answer key, they demonstrate understanding of the core concept that decreased sensory reliability leads to increased influence of prior beliefs on perception.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You donâ€™t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other peopleâ€™s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

Preconventional: you act based on following a rule. Conventional: you act because you think it is the correct or appropriate thing to do. ...: you act after carefully reasoning and deciding that it is the best or most justified choice.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes preconventional as simply 'following a rule' but misses the key aspect of avoiding punishment or gaining rewards as the motivation.
- Correct: The student correctly captures the conventional level as acting based on what is 'correct or appropriate,' which aligns with focusing on social norms and others' feelings.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the post-conventional level as acting after 'carefully reasoning' to make the 'most justified choice,' which corresponds to focusing on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

When you possess a model of an event, the cause-and-effect relationships become clear in your mind, making it challenging to envision alternative possible outcomes.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions 'a model of an event' and 'cause-and-effect relationships' but doesn't clearly define what a causal model is - specifically that it's a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student correctly explains how causal models contribute to hindsight bias by noting that clear cause-and-effect relationships make it 'challenging to envision alternative possible outcomes,' which aligns with events seeming more inevitable than they were.

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Once you acquire new knowledge, it cannot be taken back, and it becomes challenging to evaluate a situation without considering what you've learned.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that newly acquired knowledge cannot be ignored when making retrospective judgments, which is the core mechanism of how learning contributes to hindsight bias. The answer captures the essential idea that once you learn something, it becomes difficult to evaluate past situations without that knowledge influencing your judgment.

Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing involves selecting the optimal choice, while satisficing means picking an option that meets an acceptable standard. Neuroticism is linked to maximizing.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as 'selecting the optimal choice' which aligns with 'trying to make the best choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as 'picking an option that meets an acceptable standard' which corresponds to 'making a good-enough choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that neuroticism is linked to maximizing, which matches the answer key's statement that high neuroticism leads to adopting the maximizing decision style.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

Student assistants can support the teacher by providing feedback and grading assignments based on a rubric created by the teacher. While developing these rubrics may require some time upfront, the long-term advantages will be beneficial if the course continues.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement by proposing a practical solution (using student assistants with teacher-created rubrics) that directly addresses the core challenge of limited time and resources while maintaining quality feedback. The answer shows understanding of the trade-off between upfront investment and long-term benefits.
