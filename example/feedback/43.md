## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

In this context, System 1 thinking refers to your intuition and is the main mode of thinking, whereas System 2 is less utilized because it involves deliberate and logical reasoning, which is less effective when thinking like a social-intuitionist. Thus, System 1 plays a more prominent role in this model.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 thinking refers to intuition, which aligns with the answer key's requirement for System 1 to be described as intuitions or emotion.
- Correct: The student accurately describes System 2 as involving 'deliberate and logical reasoning,' which matches the answer key's requirement for System 2 to be characterized as reasoning, rational thought, or deliberation.
- Correct: The student clearly states that 'System 1 plays a more prominent role in this model' and describes it as 'the main mode of thinking,' which satisfies the answer key's requirement that System 1 is more dominant than System 2.

Score: 1.0

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

Representativeness heuristic occurs when if a person has characteristic A, and the majority of people who are X also have A, it is assumed that the person with A is likely to be X as well.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process, which matches the first point in the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately explains the representativeness heuristic by describing how we judge likelihood of category membership based on similarity to typical characteristics of that category, which aligns with the answer key's explanation about estimating likelihood based on resemblance to stereotypes.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring refers to the initial impression you form, which can be modified by subsequent experiences, but only to a certain extent rather than completely replaced. The primacy effect means that your initial encounter with someone tends to have the strongest and most lasting impact. Both concepts emphasize the significance of your first interactions with others.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as related to initial impressions that serve as starting points, though they focus on interpersonal contexts rather than the broader cognitive bias definition.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as the tendency for initial encounters to have the strongest and most lasting impact, which aligns with better remembering first information.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both concepts emphasize the significance of first interactions/information, demonstrating understanding of their shared reliance on initial information.

Score: 1.0

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the reluctance to experience any loss, whereas risk aversion is the avoidance of taking any risks that could lead to loss, regardless of how small the risk may be.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes loss aversion as 'reluctance to experience any loss' but misses the key concept that losses are weighted more heavily than equivalent gains. The definition lacks the comparative aspect that is central to loss aversion.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly defines risk aversion as 'avoidance of taking any risks that could lead to loss' which is too extreme and focuses only on potential losses. Risk aversion is actually about preferring certainty over uncertainty in general, not just avoiding all risks.

Score: 0.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias refers to the tendency to overestimate the intensity and duration of negative emotions following events such as a breakup or job loss. As a result, individuals may remain in unhappy relationships because they anticipate that ending them will cause more stress and anxiety than continuing to stay.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies impact bias as the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on emotions, though they specify 'intensity and duration of negative emotions' which is more specific but still captures the core concept.
- Correct: The student correctly explains that impact bias prevents breakups because people overestimate how bad (stressful and anxiety-provoking) the breakup will make them feel, leading them to stay in unhappy relationships.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves anticipating how you will feel mentally in the future. For example, a young and healthy person might claim they would choose to end their life if they became disabled in a specific way, believing they would be extremely unhappy in that condition, even though they lack firsthand experience of it. This is essentially a prediction. Once that situation actually occurs, their mental state might turn out to be quite different. Therefore, this concept is crucial to keep in mind when making end-of-life decisions, as a person’s feelings at the time may differ greatly from their previous expectations.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines affective forecasting as predicting future emotional/mental states, using the phrase 'anticipating how you will feel mentally in the future' and describing it as 'essentially a prediction.'
- Correct: The student accurately captures the key insight that healthy people may predict they'd prefer death when sick/disabled, but their actual feelings may differ when the situation occurs, demonstrated through their example of disability and the statement that 'their mental state might turn out to be quite different.'

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

They tend to underestimate small probabilities, and there is a distinction between just low probabilities and those that are extremely low.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student states that people underestimate small probabilities, but according to prospect theory, merely low probabilities (like 10%) are actually overestimated, not underestimated.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that there is a distinction between low probabilities and extremely low probabilities, which aligns with the answer key's point about different treatment of these probability ranges.

Score: 0.5

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion involves avoiding actions when the result is expected to be negative, indicating that the individual would incur a loss from taking that action.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes loss aversion as avoiding negative outcomes, but fails to capture the key concept that loss aversion reflects asymmetric weighting where negative utilities (losses) are weighted more heavily than equivalent positive utilities (gains). The answer doesn't mention the steeper value function for losses or the differential treatment of gains versus losses.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected utility theory incorporates decision-making actions into the framework, while expected value theory primarily emphasizes the financial aspects of the event.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory emphasizes financial aspects, which aligns with the answer key point that expected value theory deals only with financial values while expected utility theory deals with broader non-financial values.
- Incorrect: The student mentions that expected utility theory incorporates decision-making actions, but fails to address the key distinction about risk aversion and heuristics/biases that differentiate expected utility theory from expected value theory.

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected value theory refers to the overall anticipated monetary amount in a given scenario. Expected utility theory refers to the overall anticipated value, which may include non-monetary factors, in a given scenario.

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies expected value theory as dealing with monetary outcomes and mentions the anticipatory/probabilistic nature, though doesn't explicitly mention probabilities of different outcomes.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies expected utility theory as extending beyond monetary factors to include subjective/non-monetary utilities, showing understanding of the key difference from expected value theory.
- Incorrect: Student does not mention multi-attribute utility theory at all, which involves multiple attributes each with utilities and weights.
- Incorrect: Student does not mention prospect theory at all, which is the descriptive/behavioral model that incorporates heuristics and biases.

Score: 0.5

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

It causes individuals to be more cautious about taking risks.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student answer contradicts the answer key. The student states that loss aversion makes people more cautious about risks, but the answer key indicates that loss aversion can actually decrease risk aversion and make people risk-seeking when trying to avoid potential losses.

Score: 0.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves connecting two events, such as associating the sound of a bell with dinner being served. Classical conditioning occurs when one event consistently follows another. Operant conditioning, on the other hand, involves using rewards and punishments—rewarding good behavior and punishing bad behavior.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as connecting/associating events, which aligns with learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of classical conditioning as events happening together consistently, matching the concept of things happening together in time and space leading to association.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as involving rewards and punishments, which captures the core concept that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation occurs when it appears that one event causes another, but in reality, only a correlation exists. Illusory correlation, on the other hand, happens when it seems there is a correlation between events, but no actual relationship exists.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly distinguishes between illusory causation (misinterpreting correlation as causation) and illusory correlation (perceiving correlation where none exists). The explanation accurately captures that illusory causation involves mistaking an existing correlation for a causal relationship, while illusory correlation involves perceiving a correlation that doesn't actually exist.

Score: 1.0

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

The healthcare system is a framework, whereas the birthday party follows a script. This is due to the healthcare system being a stable institution that remains consistent.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that the healthcare system is a schema (though they use 'framework' which is acceptable) and recognizes it as stable knowledge structure, demonstrating understanding of the conceptual difference.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that the birthday party behavior follows a script, showing they understand scripts relate to behavioral sequences in specific situations.

Score: 1.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

Sure, please provide the text you'd like me to rephrase.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student did not provide an answer to the question. Instead, they asked for text to rephrase, which is completely unrelated to the question about behaviorism and Dennett's stances.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

The availability heuristic and negativity bias cause you to believe that negative behavior is more common than it actually is because you frequently encounter negative content on social media, leading you to absorb more negativity and perceive it as widespread.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias and explains that it involves focusing on negative information, which aligns with the answer key's description of seeking out or placing more weight on negative content.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the availability heuristic and demonstrates understanding that frequent encounters with negative content make it seem more common, which matches the answer key's explanation of estimating frequency based on ease of recall.
- Correct: The student successfully connects how negativity bias leads to absorbing more negative content, which then through availability heuristic makes negative behavior seem more widespread, demonstrating the causal relationship described in the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

Applying knowledge from one domain within the framework of another often leads to failure or errors. Similarly, if you rely on something from someone you dislike, you are likely to doubt its effectiveness, since your perspective differs significantly from that of the person you strongly dislike.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student discusses applying knowledge across domains and mentions doubting effectiveness due to dislike, but fails to identify the specific biological concept of contagion being misapplied to the social/psychological domain, which is the key mechanism explaining magical contagion.

Score: 0.0

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A delusional conspiracy theory is one that is generally considered false, whereas a non-delusional conspiracy theory is generally accepted as true.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student only identifies the 'commonly accepted' criterion but misses the key 'irrational belief' component. The answer key requires both conditions: a conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief AND not commonly accepted.

Score: 0.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

Low intelligence, feelings of social exclusion, and firm political convictions.

Feedback:

- Correct: Low intelligence is explicitly mentioned in the answer key as one of the cognitive factors contributing to conspiratorial thinking.
- Incorrect: Feelings of social exclusion is not listed among the cognitive and personality factors in the answer key.
- Incorrect: Firm political convictions is not mentioned in the answer key as one of the specified cognitive and personality factors.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Tendency to focus more on negative information.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's answer about 'tendency to focus more on negative information' describes negativity bias, which is not relevant to how incorrect answers interfere with learning. The answer key requires explanation of source amnesia (forgetting the incorrectness of initial answers), proactive interference, or the continued-influence effect.

Score: 0.0

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

When something is easier for you to recall, you are likely to perceive it as occurring more quickly, as you frequently hear about it, which is a result of the availability heuristic. Politicians attempt to exploit this heuristic to make their messages more appealing.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student only discusses the availability heuristic, which was already mentioned in the question. They fail to identify the additional psychological mechanism (mere exposure effect or illusory-truth effect) that politicians use when repeating statements to make them more attractive through familiarity.

Score: 0.0

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

No, it does not.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly identifies that major depressive disorder does not make people less accurate, but fails to explain the key mechanism - that depressed individuals are more accurate due to reduced optimism bias and more realistic risk assessments.

Score: 0.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

The impact of existing beliefs increases.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that prior beliefs have increased influence when sensory information is less reliable, which matches the core concept from the answer key.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

Of course! Please provide the text you would like me to rephrase.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student did not provide any description of the pre-conventional level or any equivalent description focusing on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Incorrect: The student did not provide any description of the conventional level or any equivalent description focusing on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Incorrect: The student did not provide any description of the post-conventional level or any equivalent description focusing on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

The causal model describes and explains the event, which reinforces hindsight bias.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions that a causal model 'describes and explains the event' but fails to capture the key concept that it is a coherent narrative showing how past events are related to each other.
- Incorrect: While the student correctly states that causal models reinforce hindsight bias, they do not explain the mechanism - that events in causal models seem more inevitable than they actually were.

Score: 0.0

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

It contributes by drawing lessons from the event that occurred, without considering other potential outcomes.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes a general learning process but misses the key mechanism of hindsight bias - that newly learned information (knowing the outcome) interferes with our ability to accurately recall what we thought before we knew that outcome. The answer doesn't address how learning affects our estimation of past likelihood judgments.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing decision-making is characterized by perfectionism and aims to find the optimal choice. Satisficing decision-making settles for an adequate option rather than the perfect one. People who are neurotic often prefer to use maximizing decision-making.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as aiming for the optimal/best choice, using the term 'perfectionism' which aligns with trying to make the best choice.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as settling for an adequate option rather than the perfect one, which matches the concept of making a good-enough choice.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that neurotic people prefer maximizing decision-making, which aligns with the answer key's statement about high neuroticism leading to maximizing decision style.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

I would first seek assistance from the faculty itself, such as enlisting teaching assistants to help with grading (a common practice in sociology, which is my undergraduate program). This approach could save a significant amount of time and allow for more personalized feedback to students. However, it might also lead to hindsight bias if the results are not as expected, since the outcomes can vary. This bias may arise from negative results that seem like they should have been predictable in retrospect. While it’s not an easy solution, apart from using AI for grading exams, I don’t really see any other viable options.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement with the question by proposing a practical solution (using teaching assistants), acknowledging potential limitations and biases, and considering alternative approaches like AI grading. The response shows thoughtful consideration of the constraints mentioned in the question and reflects genuine effort to address the challenge of engaging many students with limited resources.
