## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidtâ€™s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

System 1 thinking relies on moral intuition, while System 2 thinking involves moral reasoning. The model suggests that moral judgment is primarily driven by intuition rather than deliberate thought, making System 1 thinking more influential.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 thinking relies on moral intuition, which aligns with the answer key's requirement about System 1 referring to intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student accurately describes System 2 thinking as involving moral reasoning, which matches the answer key's requirement about System 2 referring to reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student clearly states that moral judgment is primarily driven by intuition rather than deliberate thought, making System 1 more influential, which directly corresponds to the answer key's requirement that System 1 is more dominant than System 2.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

The representativeness heuristic is a mental shortcut where we estimate the probability of something being part of a group by comparing how much it resembles typical members of that group.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process in this scenario.
- Correct: The student accurately explains the representativeness heuristic as estimating probability of group membership based on resemblance to typical group members, which matches the key concept of using stereotypical features to make judgments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring occurs when we rely on initial information to form our first impressions. The primacy effect means that early details have a stronger influence on our judgments than later ones. Both concepts share the idea that early information carries more weight than what comes afterward, unlike the recency effect.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that anchoring involves relying on initial information, which aligns with the answer key's description of taking the first piece of information as a starting point.
- Incorrect: The student describes primacy effect as early details having stronger influence on judgments, but the answer key specifically defines it as the tendency to better remember the first piece of information, which is about memory retention rather than judgment influence.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both concepts involve giving more weight to early/first information, which matches the answer key's point about overreliance on the first piece of information.

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion relates to how we value gains and losses, while risk aversion is about our attitude toward uncertain outcomes.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion relates to how we value gains and losses, which captures the essence of weighing losses more heavily than gains.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that risk aversion is about our attitude toward uncertain outcomes, which effectively captures the preference for certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 1.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias is when individuals exaggerate how much future events will affect their emotions. Because people often overestimate how sad they'll be after a breakup, they may choose to remain in their current relationship.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as exaggerating how much future events will affect emotions, which matches the answer key's definition of overestimating the impact of future events on future feelings.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that people may stay in relationships because they overestimate how sad they'll be after a breakup, which aligns with the answer key's point about overestimating how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves predicting how you'll feel in the future. Given that humans are often poor at this, is it acceptable to end someone's life (if they can't decide for themselves) solely because they once stated they'd prefer death over severe illness?

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies affective forecasting as predicting future emotional states, which matches the answer key's definition of 'predictions about our own future emotional state.'
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of the key issue by questioning whether past preferences should determine end-of-life decisions, implicitly recognizing that people's actual preferences when sick may differ from their healthy predictions, which aligns with the answer key's second point.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

Individuals tend to exaggerate the likelihood of events with modest probabilities, like 10%, but significantly downplay the chances of very rare events, such as those with a 0.01% probability, often dismissing them as impossible.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people overestimate modest/low probabilities like 10%, which aligns with the answer key's point about merely low probabilities being overestimated.
- Correct: The student accurately describes that extremely low probabilities (0.01%) are often dismissed as impossible, which matches the answer key's point about extremely low probabilities being interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

We often fail to recognize the practical benefits that come from experiencing setbacks.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student answer discusses general benefits of setbacks but does not address the specific concept of loss aversion in prospect theory, which relates to how negative utilities are weighted more heavily than positive utilities in the value function.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

1. Expected value theory is limited to financial contexts, while expected utility theory considers various types of benefits from outcomes.
2. Expected utility theory factors in risk aversion, unlike expected value theory, which does not.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory is limited to financial contexts while expected utility theory considers various types of benefits, which aligns with the answer key's distinction between financial and non-financial values.
- Correct: The student accurately states that expected utility theory factors in risk aversion while expected value theory does not, which matches the answer key's point about expected utility theory considering risk aversion versus expected value theory not considering heuristics and biases.

Score: 1.0

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesnâ€™t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

1. Expected value theory is a normative approach for decision-making among multiple choices, where each choice has various financial results, each with its own likelihood.

2. Expected utility theory is a normative framework for selecting among different options, resembling expected value theory but allowing for any type of utility, including subjective ones.

3. Multi-attribute utility theory is a normative model for making decisions between multiple alternatives, where each option has several attributes, each with its own utility and importance.

4. Prospect theory is a descriptive model for decision-making among various choices, building on expected utility theory by incorporating heuristics and cognitive biases.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as a normative model for decision-making with multiple choices having financial outcomes and probabilities, matching the key concepts from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes expected utility theory as similar to expected value theory but with utilities that can be subjective rather than just financial, which aligns with the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly explains multi-attribute utility theory as a normative model where options have multiple attributes, each with utility and weight/importance, matching the answer key requirements.
- Correct: The student properly identifies prospect theory as a descriptive model that builds on expected utility theory while incorporating heuristics and biases, which corresponds to the answer key description.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease peopleâ€™s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

We place greater importance on losses than on gains. As a result, when there's a chance to avoid a loss, we become more willing to take risks (and thus less cautious). Conversely, when things are already going well, we tend to be more cautious and avoid risks.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion leads people to become more willing to take risks when facing potential losses, which decreases risk aversion. The additional point about being more cautious when things are going well demonstrates a deeper understanding of how loss aversion affects risk preferences in different contexts.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves learning connections through patterns of occurrence. In classical conditioning, we link things that frequently appear together in the same context. In operant conditioning, we learn that certain behaviors lead to consequences, whether positive or negative.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as learning connections/associations through patterns, which matches the concept of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as linking things that frequently appear together in the same context, which aligns with the key point about associating things that happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning that behaviors lead to consequences (positive or negative), which matches the key point about learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory correlation occurs when individuals perceive a connection between two things that doesn't actually exist. On the other hand, illusory causation involves situations where there might be a relationship between two variables, but it doesn't necessarily mean one causes the other.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that illusory correlation involves perceiving a connection that doesn't exist, and illusory causation involves misinterpreting relationships as causal when they may not be. While the wording differs from the answer key, the core distinction is captured - illusory correlation is about false perception of correlation, while illusory causation is about incorrectly assuming causation from correlation.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to â€˜properlyâ€™ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

Knowing how the Dutch healthcare system operates is an example of a schema, while knowing how to act at a birthday party is an example of a script. A schema involves understanding the connections between different ideas, while a script is a mental framework for typical social scenarios. A birthday party fits into the category of a common social situation.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that understanding the Dutch healthcare system is a schema and provides an appropriate explanation that it involves understanding connections between different ideas, which aligns with the answer key's description of schemas as knowledge and relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that knowing how to act at a birthday party is a script and explains it as a mental framework for typical social scenarios, which matches the answer key's description of scripts as social schemas describing behavior in specific situations.

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

The intentional stance is most effective for explaining how stimuli lead to behavior when analyzed at a level that focuses on behavior and intention, rather than physical or design-based terms.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies behaviorists as adopting the intentional stance, when they actually adopted the physical stance. Behaviorists explicitly rejected mentalistic concepts like intentions and focused on observable stimulus-response relationships at the physical level.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

The functional perspective focuses on psychological processes and how their characteristics (or design) can encourage beneficial results.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes the functional perspective but does not identify which of Dennett's stances evolutionary psychologists adopt. The answer key requires identifying the 'design stance' specifically, which the student fails to mention.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

1. Uniqueness. B occurs only after A and rarely after other events.
2. Regularity. Whenever A happens, B always follows.
3. Believability. Based on common knowledge, itâ€™s highly likely that B follows A.
4. Proximity. B happens soon after A in the same place.
5. Resemblance. A and B share similar characteristics and outcomes.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the concept of distinctness/specificity using the term 'uniqueness' and accurately explains that B should occur only after A and rarely after other events.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies consistency using the term 'regularity' and accurately explains that B should always follow A when A occurs.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies plausibility using the term 'believability' and accurately explains that common knowledge should support the causal relationship.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies contiguity in time and space using the term 'proximity' and accurately explains that A and B should occur close together in time and location.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies similarity in cause and effect using the term 'resemblance' and accurately explains that A and B should share similar characteristics.

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Our tendency to focus on negative emotions, known as the negativity bias, leads us to consume more negative content, which subtly shapes our beliefs. Additionally, the confirmation bias drives us to seek out information that aligns with our existing views. This reinforces our beliefs and creates the illusion that everyone shares the same perspective.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias and explains that it causes us to focus on and consume more negative content, which aligns with the answer key's explanation of seeking out negative information like morally outraged content.
- Incorrect: The student mentions confirmation bias instead of the availability heuristic. While confirmation bias is a real cognitive bias, it doesn't explain how we overestimate frequency based on easily recalled examples, which is the key mechanism described in the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student doesn't explain the specific mechanism of how negativity bias and the availability heuristic work together to cause overestimation. Instead, they describe a different process involving confirmation bias creating an illusion of shared perspective.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

Framework theories are general, everyday understandings of how things function in areas like physics, biology, and psychology. Magical contagion happens when we apply concepts from one field to another. For instance, we take the biological idea that germs spread and mistakenly believe that negative personality traits can be contagious too.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that magical contagion involves applying biological concepts (like contagion/germs spreading) to the social/psychological domain (negative personality traits being 'contagious'), which matches the answer key's requirement of explaining this as incorrectly applying biological domain concepts to the social domain.

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A delusional conspiracy theory lacks cultural acceptance, while a non-delusional one is widely embraced.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student only identifies cultural acceptance as the distinguishing factor but misses the crucial element that a delusional conspiracy theory must also be an irrational belief. The answer key requires both irrationality AND lack of common acceptance to distinguish delusional from non-delusional conspiracy theories.

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

1. Spot patterns in random events.
2. Have faith in supernatural occurrences.
3. Attribute intentions or actions to things that lack them.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'seeing patterns in randomness' as a cognitive factor contributing to conspiratorial thinking, using slightly different wording but conveying the same concept.
- Correct: The student accurately describes 'believing paranormal phenomena' using the phrase 'have faith in supernatural occurrences,' which effectively captures the same idea.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'attributing agency where it does not exist' by describing it as attributing intentions or actions to things that lack them, demonstrating understanding of this cognitive bias.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you donâ€™t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

The challenge of being too familiar with a topic, making it hard to communicate clearly to those who lack the same understanding.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes the curse of knowledge, which is about difficulty communicating due to expertise, but the question asks about how incorrect quiz answers interfere with learning. The correct mechanisms are source amnesia (forgetting the answer was wrong) or proactive interference (old incorrect answers interfering with new correct ones).

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

Simply being exposed

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The answer is incomplete and lacks the key psychological mechanism. While 'being exposed' hints at the mere exposure effect, the student fails to identify the specific concept of 'mere exposure' or explain that it involves preference for familiar things.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

No, it increases their accuracy by reducing the positivity bias.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that major depressive disorder increases accuracy in predictions and correctly attributes this to reduced positivity bias (equivalent to reduced overly optimistic tendencies mentioned in the answer key).

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

In this scenario, prior beliefs have a stronger impact, causing perception to align more closely with those preexisting beliefs.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that prior beliefs have a stronger impact when sensory information reliability decreases, which directly matches the key concept that perception becomes increasingly affected by prior beliefs in such conditions.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You donâ€™t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other peopleâ€™s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

1. Pre-conventional stage: At this level, individuals see good actions as those that bring rewards and bad actions as those that lead to punishment, with a primary concern for personal gain.
2. Conventional stage: Here, people aim to be seen as good by others and follow societal laws, prioritizing the feelings and expectations of those around them.
3. Post-conventional stage: At this level, individuals understand that moral values may sometimes clash, and they focus on broader ethical principles.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the pre-conventional level as focusing on rewards and punishment avoidance, which matches the answer key's description of obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as following societal laws and prioritizing others' feelings and expectations, which aligns with the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the post-conventional level as focusing on broader ethical principles and understanding moral value conflicts, which matches the answer key's description of focusing on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model is a logical explanation we construct after an event occurs. Because we naturally form these explanations based on what actually happenedâ€”not on what might have happened but didnâ€™tâ€”our minds recall the actual events more easily, making us perceive them as more probable.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies a causal model as a logical explanation constructed after events occur, which aligns with the key concept of a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student accurately explains how causal models contribute to hindsight bias by making actual events seem more probable/inevitable than they were, demonstrating understanding of the mechanism behind hindsight bias.

Score: 1.0

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

When trying to recall past probability assessments, it's nearly impossible not to factor in new information about the situation. With this updated knowledge, an event appears much more probable than it originally did.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly explains that when recalling past probability assessments, new information cannot be avoided and makes events seem more probable in hindsight. This captures the core mechanism of hindsight bias described in the answer key, though they don't use the technical term 'curse of knowledge'.

Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Seeking the best possible options is what maximizing entails, while satisficing involves settling for choices that are simply adequate. Individuals with high levels of neuroticism are more likely to use a maximizing approach when making decisions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as seeking the best possible options, which aligns with the answer key's definition of trying to make the best choice.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as settling for choices that are simply adequate, which matches the answer key's definition of making a good-enough choice.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that individuals with high levels of neuroticism are more likely to use a maximizing approach, which matches the answer key's statement about the maximizing decision style.

Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

The course taught us that clinical intuition, tied to personalized feedback, is both time-consuming and prone to biases. As a result, statistical predictions are preferred since they require less time and are more accurate in forecasting academic success.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement by connecting course concepts (clinical vs. statistical prediction) to the teaching scenario, recognizing the time constraints mentioned in the question, and proposing a solution based on statistical approaches over personalized feedback methods.
