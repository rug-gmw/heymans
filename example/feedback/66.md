Grade: 10.0

## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidtâ€™s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

According to this model, our moral decisions stem from instinctive, immediate feelings rather than from careful, thoughtful analysis. These instinctive, spontaneous reactions align with System 1 thinking, whereas conscious, reflective reasoning corresponds to System 2 thinking. Therefore, the model argues that moral judgments are primarily driven by System 1 processes.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 thinking involves 'instinctive, immediate feelings' which aligns with the answer key's requirement that System 1 refers to intuitions/emotions.
- Correct: The student accurately describes System 2 thinking as 'conscious, reflective reasoning' which matches the answer key's requirement that System 2 refers to reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student clearly states that 'moral judgments are primarily driven by System 1 processes,' which correctly identifies System 1 as the dominant system according to Haidt's model.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

Representativeness heuristic refers to the tendency to estimate the probability of an event or category membership by how much the event, object, or person resembles a typical example of that event or category.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive bias in this scenario.
- Correct: The student provides an accurate explanation of the representativeness heuristic, describing how we estimate probability based on resemblance to typical examples or stereotypes of a category.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring is a cognitive shortcut where an initial piece of information heavily influences your estimate or impression. Primacy refers to the strong impact that first information has on shaping memory or impressions. Both concepts share the idea that early information exerts an outsized influence on judgment or perception.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as being influenced by initial information, which aligns with the answer key's definition of taking the first piece of information as a starting point.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as the strong impact of first information on memory and impressions, which matches the answer key's emphasis on better remembering first information.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both concepts involve early/first information having disproportionate influence on judgment, which corresponds to the answer key's point about overreliance on first information.

Score: 1.0

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion is connected to utility, referring to our strong preference to avoid losing utility. Risk aversion pertains to risk, involving our overall inclination to steer clear of risky situations.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes loss aversion as avoiding losing utility, but misses the key concept that losses are weighted more heavily than equivalent gains. The answer is too vague and doesn't capture the asymmetric valuation between losses and gains.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that risk aversion involves avoiding risky situations, which aligns with the key concept of preferring certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 0.5

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias refers to the tendency to misjudge how much an event will affect our future emotions. In an unhappy relationship, this bias leads us to believe that ending the relationship will cause more sadness than it truly will, prompting us to remain together.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies impact bias as misjudging how much an event will affect future emotions, which captures the essence of overestimating the impact of future events on our feelings.
- Correct: The student accurately explains how impact bias prevents breakups by describing that people believe ending the relationship will cause more sadness than it actually will, which aligns with overestimating how bad a breakup will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves anticipating your future emotional states. When making end-of-life choices, it's common to believe that decisions made in advance will align with those made when the situation actually arises; however, this is not always true due to the influence of impact bias.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies affective forecasting as anticipating/predicting future emotional states, which matches the answer key definition.
- Correct: The student captures the key concept that advance decisions may not align with actual preferences when the situation occurs, which corresponds to the answer key's point about healthy people predicting they'd prefer to die when sick but potentially feeling differently when actually sick.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

Prospect theory suggests that individuals tend to overvalue small chances. However, when probabilities are extremely low, people usually treat them as impossible and ignore them entirely.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that prospect theory shows people 'overvalue small chances,' which aligns with the answer key point that merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Correct: The student accurately states that extremely low probabilities are 'treated as impossible and ignored entirely,' which matches the answer key point that extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion means that losses are perceived as more negative than their rational value suggests. In other words, when faced with two outcomes of equal magnitude but opposite nature (such as losing 10 euros versus winning 10 euros), the negative impact of the loss is weighted more heavily than the positive impact of the gain, for example assigning utility values of -15 for the loss and 10 for the gain.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly explains that loss aversion means negative utilities (losses) are weighed more heavily than positive utilities (gains) of equal magnitude, and provides a clear numerical example showing the steeper value function for losses (-15) compared to gains (+10).

Score: 1.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory (EVT) focuses solely on monetary outcomes, whereas expected utility theory (EUT) takes into account decisions involving subjective values beyond just money. Additionally, EVT ignores biases, while EUT accounts for risk aversion.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory focuses on monetary/financial outcomes while expected utility theory considers subjective values beyond money, which aligns with the answer key's distinction between financial and non-financial values.
- Correct: The student accurately states that expected value theory ignores biases while expected utility theory accounts for risk aversion, which matches the answer key's point about EVT not considering heuristics and biases versus EUT considering risk aversion.

Score: 1.0

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesnâ€™t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Behavioral life-cycle hypothesis is primarily a descriptive model explaining how individuals handle their wealth. It recognizes mental accounting, which violates the fungibility principle by treating different segments of wealth distinctly, and also accounts for loss aversion. Expected value theory (EVT) is a normative framework describing how people allocate resources, focusing strictly on monetary sources and calculating expected values using monetary outcomes and probabilities. It assumes full knowledge of outcomes and probabilities and does not consider cognitive biases. Expected utility theory (EUT) is also mainly normative and similar to EVT, but it includes non-monetary outcomes and the subjective utility assigned to them. Like EVT, it assumes certainty of outcomes and probabilities but acknowledges risk aversion. Multiple Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT) extends utility calculations to multiple factors, akin to EUT, but instead of probabilities, it uses weights reflecting the importance of each attribute to the individual. MAUT is normative because it provides values to guide decisions. Prospect theory is a descriptive model that accounts for biases and heuristics, highlighting that people evaluate gains and losses relative to a reference point and exhibit skewed perceptions of subjective values and probabilities.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies Expected Value Theory as a normative model focusing on monetary outcomes with probabilities, though they include some unnecessary details about assumptions.
- Correct: The student accurately describes Expected Utility Theory as similar to EVT but including non-monetary, subjective utility outcomes, correctly distinguishing it from purely financial measures.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies MAUT as a normative model dealing with multiple attributes that have weights reflecting importance, accurately capturing the key concept of weighted attributes.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies Prospect Theory as a descriptive model that accounts for biases and heuristics, mentioning reference points and skewed perceptions which aligns with the behavioral nature described in the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease peopleâ€™s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

When facing potential losses (loss framing), our strong dislike of losing drives us to take risks to prevent the loss, making us more willing to take risks and less cautious.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion leads people to take risks when facing potential losses, demonstrating understanding that loss aversion can decrease risk aversion and make people risk-seeking in loss domains.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves learning connections based on things occurring together. In classical conditioning, we associate two events that occur near each other in time and location. In operant conditioning, we understand that our behaviors lead to certain outcomes, such as rewards or punishments.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as learning connections/associations based on things occurring together, which matches the key concept of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as associating two events that occur near each other in time and location, which aligns with the answer key's description of learning to associate things that happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as understanding that behaviors lead to outcomes like rewards or punishments, which matches the answer key's definition of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory correlations occur when people perceive a relationship between two variables even though none actually exists (the correlation is purely by chance). Illusory causation involves assuming a cause-and-effect link between stimuli that are not truly connected in that way.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly distinguishes between illusory correlation (perceiving a relationship between variables when none exists) and illusory causation (assuming a cause-and-effect link between unconnected stimuli). While the wording differs from the answer key, the core concepts are accurately captured - illusory correlation is about perceiving non-existent correlations, while illusory causation is about incorrectly inferring causal relationships.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to â€˜properlyâ€™ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

The healthcare system functions as a schema, representing general knowledge that helps in comprehending a concept. On the other hand, knowing how to act appropriately at a birthday party is a scriptâ€” a type of schema designed for a specific, routine event that directs behavior within a particular social or cultural context.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the healthcare system as a schema and provides appropriate reasoning that it represents general knowledge for understanding a concept, which aligns with the answer key's explanation about knowledge and relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies birthday party behavior as a script and provides accurate reasoning that it's a type of schema for specific, routine events that directs behavior in particular social/cultural contexts, which matches the answer key's explanation about social schemas for specific situations.

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

Behaviorists take a mechanical approach, focusing solely on explaining how something occurs based on physical factors, without inferring any unobservable intentions, motivations, or desires.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that behaviorists adopted the physical stance by describing their 'mechanical approach' focused on 'physical factors' without considering unobservable mental states. This aligns with the answer key's emphasis on behaviorists focusing on processes that cause stimuli to result in behavior, which is characteristic of the physical stance.

Score: 1.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

The perspective adopted is the functional or design stance. This approach clarifies the reason behind the design of something and its purpose, focusing on the function, which is what evolutionary psychologists examineâ€”the functional adaptive benefits of mental processes.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance and provides accurate reasoning that this stance focuses on function and purpose, which aligns with how evolutionary psychologists examine the adaptive benefits of psychological processes.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Consistency refers to how regularly the cause-effect link occurs; when A takes place, does B often follow? Distinctiveness considers if the result is mainly tied to the cause; does B mostly happen after A rather than after other events? Similarity of cause and effect looks at whether the cause and effect resemble each other; is A alike in nature to B? Continuance in time and space examines if the two events happen near one another in timing or location; do A and B occur close together in time or place? Temporal order checks if the cause happens before the effect; does A typically come before B, while B does not come before A?

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes consistency as regularity of the cause-effect relationship, matching the answer key's definition that B always follows A.
- Correct: The student accurately explains distinctiveness as B being mainly tied to A rather than other events, which aligns with the answer key's specificity concept.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention plausibility, which is about common sense making the causal relationship believable.
- Correct: The student correctly describes contiguity in time and space as events happening close together in timing or location, matching the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately explains similarity as cause and effect resembling each other in nature, matching the answer key's definition.

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Availability heuristic is a mental shortcut where we judge the likelihood of an event based on how quickly and frequently we can recall examples of it. Confirmation bias involves looking only for evidence that supports a particular belief while ignoring any evidence that contradicts it. When you encounter many instances of morally outraged people, you start to believe they are more prevalent than they really are (availability heuristic: because you see numerous examples, they come to mind more readily). Once you hold the belief that morally outraged people are common, you then focus on finding information that confirms this idea and overlook information that challenges it (confirmation bias).

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies and defines the availability heuristic, explaining how frequent recall of examples leads to overestimation of prevalence.
- Incorrect: The student identifies confirmation bias instead of negativity bias. While confirmation bias is related, the answer key specifically requires negativity bias as the tendency to seek out or weight negative information more heavily.
- Correct: The student explains the interaction between the two biases they identified, showing how availability heuristic leads to overestimation based on readily recalled examples, which mirrors the key's explanation of the mechanism.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

This phenomenon is known as the law of contagion. Framework theories serve as everyday foundational knowledge across three key areasâ€”physics, biology, and psychology/cultureâ€”that help us make sense of the world. When we mistakenly apply knowledge from one domain to another (mixing up core knowledge), it leads to a magical contagion effect. In this case, biological concepts of contamination are wrongly applied to psychological contexts.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that biological concepts of contamination/contagion are being incorrectly applied to psychological/social contexts, which directly matches the answer key's requirement about applying contagion from the biological domain to the social/psychological/cultural domain.

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

Delusional conspiracy theories are uncommon and not accepted by society, whereas non-delusional conspiracy theories may be commonly believed and considered acceptable within a culture.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly identifies that delusional conspiracy theories are not commonly accepted, but fails to mention the crucial criterion of irrationality. The answer key requires both conditions: the belief must be irrational AND not commonly accepted. The student only addresses the social acceptance aspect.

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

1) displaying self-centeredness 2) detecting order in chaotic situations 3) assigning intentional actions where there are none expected

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies narcissism/self-centeredness as a factor contributing to conspiratorial thinking, which matches 'being narcissistic' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes 'seeing patterns in randomness' by stating 'detecting order in chaotic situations,' which is essentially the same concept.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'attributing agency where it does not exist' by describing 'assigning intentional actions where there are none expected,' which captures the same psychological phenomenon.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you donâ€™t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Source amnesia can play a role by causing you to forget the origin and circumstances of the information you learned, leading to a loss of context around the incorrect answer. As a result, you might no longer remember that the answer is wrong.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies source amnesia as the key mechanism and accurately explains how it works - by causing forgetting of the source/context of information, which can lead to mistaking an incorrect answer for a correct one. This matches the core concept in the answer key.

Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

The mere exposure effect causes us to find things more appealing simply because we encounter them often.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the mere exposure effect as the psychological mechanism and accurately describes it as making things more appealing through frequent encounters, which matches the answer key's definition of the tendency to prefer familiar things.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

No, major depression leads individuals to be more accurate because they lack the typical degree of unrealistic optimism.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people with major depressive disorder are more accurate at making predictions about negative events and correctly explains this is due to their reduced unrealistic optimism compared to non-depressed individuals.

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

As the trustworthiness of sensory data (evidence) diminishes, we rely more heavily on our prior beliefs, causing our perception to align more closely with those expectations than with the actual evidence.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when sensory information becomes less reliable/trustworthy, prior beliefs have increased influence on perception, and that perception aligns more with expectations. This demonstrates understanding of the core concept from the answer key.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You donâ€™t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other peopleâ€™s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

Pre-conventional level: moral behavior is driven by the desire to gain rewards and avoid punishments, with an emphasis on self-interest and mutual exchange. Conventional level: moral decisions aim to maintain social order by valuing relationships and considering others' feelings, as well as adhering to rules, laws, and authority. Post-conventional level: morality stems from a more advanced recognition of moral principles and their subjective qualities.

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly describes pre-conventional level as focusing on gaining rewards and avoiding punishments, which matches the answer key's description of obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: Student accurately describes conventional level as focusing on maintaining social order, valuing relationships, considering others' feelings, and adhering to rules and authority, which aligns with the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

The causal model suggests that we create a coherent mental narrative of past events by emphasizing their causal connections. This process enhances hindsight bias by making the cause-and-effect relationship more prominent and by hindering consideration of alternative possibilities.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a causal model is a coherent mental narrative of past events emphasizing causal connections, which matches the answer key's definition of a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student accurately explains how causal models contribute to hindsight bias by making cause-and-effect relationships more prominent and hindering consideration of alternatives, which aligns with the answer key's point that events seem more inevitable than they were.

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Due to the curse of knowledge, it is challenging to avoid relying on information we have previously acquired.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the curse of knowledge as the mechanism by which learning contributes to hindsight bias, explaining that previously acquired information is difficult to ignore when making judgments about the past.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

There are two primary decision-making styles. Maximizing involves striving to find the best possible option or make the optimal choice. Satisficing means opting for a decision that is adequate or good enough. Individuals with high levels of neuroticism tend to lean toward a maximizing approach.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines maximizing as striving to find the best possible option or make the optimal choice, which aligns with the answer key's definition of 'trying to make the best choice'.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as opting for a decision that is adequate or good enough, which matches the answer key's definition of 'making a good-enough choice'.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that individuals with high neuroticism tend to adopt a maximizing approach, which directly corresponds to the answer key's statement about high neuroticism being linked to the maximizing decision style.

Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

Incorporating additional real-life examples that provide context would be a suitable approach (even though the lectures already contain numerous examples). This would enhance learning by leveraging availability bias, making it simpler for us to generate examples.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement by proposing a specific pedagogical strategy (incorporating real-life examples) and connecting it to a psychological concept (availability bias). They show understanding of how examples can facilitate learning and make knowledge more accessible to students, which addresses the challenge of engaging many students with limited resources.
