Grade: 1.5

## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

System 1 System 2

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student only wrote 'System 1 System 2' without explaining that System 1 refers to intuitions or emotions in moral judgment.
- Incorrect: The student did not explain that System 2 refers to reasoning, rational thought, or deliberation in moral judgment.
- Incorrect: The student did not indicate which system is more dominant according to Haidt's model, nor did they specify that System 1 (intuition/emotion) is more dominant than System 2.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

Availability heuristic involves evaluating individuals based on their looks by linking them to a stereotype.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the heuristic as 'availability heuristic' when the correct answer is 'representativeness heuristic'.
- Correct: The student correctly explains the core concept of evaluating individuals based on how well they match a stereotype, which captures the essence of the representativeness heuristic despite naming it incorrectly.

Score: 0.5

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring is a type of conditioning that serves as the basis for a conceptual framework, often called "key concepts." An anchor acts as the reference point for a particular viewpoint. The primacy effect involves conditioning through neurological and cognitive triggers. Both anchoring and the primacy effect are forms of conditioning.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly describes anchoring as a type of conditioning and conceptual framework, rather than the cognitive bias of overrelying on the first piece of information encountered when making decisions.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly describes the primacy effect as involving conditioning and neurological triggers, rather than the memory phenomenon where people better remember information presented first in a sequence.
- Incorrect: The student states both are forms of conditioning, which is incorrect. The commonality should be that both involve overreliance on the first piece of information encountered.

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency to avoid or reduce losses, while risk aversion is the preference to steer clear of taking risks.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes loss aversion as 'tendency to avoid or reduce losses' but misses the key concept that losses are weighted more heavily than equivalent gains. The answer doesn't capture the asymmetric evaluation of losses versus gains.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies risk aversion as preferring to avoid risks, which aligns with the answer key's concept of preferring certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 0.5

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

People pretend their relationship is fine because ending it is difficult. Taking such a significant step can lead to permanent consequences, which is why it's seen as impactful. This fear stems from catastrophizing—imagining worst-case scenarios that haven't occurred—leading to an exaggerated perception of the situation's impact.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student does not define impact bias correctly. They describe catastrophizing and fear of consequences, but miss the key definition that impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly explains how impact bias prevents breakups by describing how people overestimate negative consequences and develop 'exaggerated perception of the situation's impact,' which aligns with overestimating how bad a breakup will make them feel.

Score: 0.5

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting is a method used to evaluate the potential impact and outcomes of a choice. It should be taken into account as it helps determine the practicality and long-term effects of decisions made at the end of life.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes affective forecasting as a method to evaluate outcomes of choices, but fails to identify that it specifically refers to predictions about one's own future emotional state.
- Incorrect: The student mentions considering long-term effects of end-of-life decisions but misses the key insight that healthy people's predictions about preferring death when sick may not match their actual preferences when they become ill.

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

It could go either way. An optimist, whether a stakeholder or researcher, might overestimate with the expectation of confirmation, while a pessimist, like a critic or skeptic, would tend to underestimate.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student discusses optimist vs pessimist perspectives but does not address that prospect theory specifically shows people tend to overestimate merely low probabilities (like 10%).
- Incorrect: The student does not mention or address how extremely low probabilities (like 0.01%) are often treated as impossibilities according to prospect theory.

Score: 0.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Utility is strongly connected to economic ideas and is often quantified in monetary terms. Loss aversion, consequently, represents the tendency to avoid losing resources and the desire to protect what one owns—whether that be money, material goods, or advantages within relationships—when faced with adverse circumstances.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes loss aversion as a general tendency to avoid losses and protect resources, but fails to address the key aspect asked in the question: how loss aversion is expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory. The answer does not mention that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities or that the value function is steeper for losses than gains.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

The primary difference lies in the measurement criteria. Utility focuses on financial and tangible (quantitative) elements, whereas value includes intangible factors like social impacts and ethical, qualitative considerations. Therefore, the second key distinction is the

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that utility focuses on financial/tangible elements while value includes intangible factors. This is backwards - expected value theory deals only with financial values, while expected utility theory incorporates broader non-financial considerations including subjective preferences.
- Incorrect: The student's answer is incomplete and cuts off mid-sentence. Additionally, they do not address the key distinction about risk aversion and heuristics/biases that differentiates expected utility theory from expected value theory.

Score: 0.0

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

I only recall the initial letter, remove the point, my mistake) s c p c

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student only provided initial letters 's c p c' which do not demonstrate understanding of expected value theory or its key concepts about financial outcomes and probabilities.
- Incorrect: The initial letters provided do not show any understanding of expected utility theory or how it differs from expected value theory with subjective utilities.
- Incorrect: The student's response of just letters does not demonstrate knowledge of multi-attribute utility theory or its components of multiple attributes, utilities, and weights.
- Incorrect: The initial letters alone do not show understanding of prospect theory as a descriptive model incorporating heuristics and biases.

Score: 0.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Loss aversion influences the limit of what is considered an acceptable loss. As a result, individuals strive to find a balance in the level of risk they are prepared to accept relative to the possible loss.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes loss aversion as affecting risk tolerance generally but misses the key insight that loss aversion can make people risk-seeking when facing potential losses. The answer doesn't capture that people become willing to accept more risk to avoid losses, which is the main point about how loss aversion decreases risk aversion.

Score: 0.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Classical conditioning involves repeatedly associating cause-and-effect events to create a connection in a person's mind. Operant conditioning, on the other hand, involves presenting information to an individual who then interprets and evaluates a sequence of events on their own.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student does not define conditioning as learning associations through covariation. They only describe classical and operant conditioning without providing an overarching definition of conditioning itself.
- Incorrect: The student describes classical conditioning as 'cause-and-effect events' rather than the correct concept of learning associations when two things happen together in time and space. Classical conditioning is not about cause-and-effect but about temporal/spatial co-occurrence.
- Incorrect: The student's description of operant conditioning as 'presenting information for interpretation and evaluation' is incorrect. They miss the key concept that operant conditioning involves learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Causation implies a direct relationship, while correlation indicates an indirect connection.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's answer confuses basic causation vs correlation concepts rather than addressing the specific phenomena of illusory causation and illusory correlation. The answer key requires distinguishing between incorrectly interpreting correlation as causation (illusory causation) versus perceiving correlation where none exists (illusory correlation), but the student discusses direct vs indirect relationships instead.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

Firstly, speaking from experience, I want to highlight that the question is phrased incorrectly. A residence permit does not require the culture test, but "permanent residency" does. Understanding healthcare is part of a framework, as it involves knowing the laws (a concrete matter).

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student identifies healthcare understanding as part of a framework but doesn't correctly explain it as a schema involving knowledge and relationships between things. The explanation focuses on laws being concrete rather than the conceptual knowledge structure aspect.
- Incorrect: The student completely fails to address the birthday party behavior example and does not identify it as a script or explain why it represents behavioral expectations in a specific social situation.

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

Qualitative aspects cannot always be measured numerically. Therefore, behaviorists argue that while conceptual frameworks can be developed, they should not be made too explicit, or they will lose their practical usefulness.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's answer does not address Daniel Dennett's stances at all and completely misses the key point about behaviorists adopting the physical stance. Instead, it discusses measurement and conceptual frameworks in a way that doesn't relate to the question about levels of analysis or why behaviorists focused on stimulus-response processes.

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

It is the brain's conditioning shaped by the functioning of human society, commonly known as the survival instinct.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student does not identify the design stance from Dennett's framework, nor do they explain that evolutionary psychologists consider psychological processes in terms of their function. Instead, they provide a vague description about conditioning and survival instinct that doesn't address the question about which of Dennett's stances evolutionary psychologists adopt.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Availability heuristic involves making judgments based on how easily one can recall or relate to certain experiences, by identifying previous events similar to A and B. This relies on association.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: Student describes availability heuristic instead of distinctness/specificity. Does not mention that B should follow A but not other events.
- Incorrect: Student does not mention consistency heuristic or the concept that B should always follow A.
- Incorrect: Student does not mention plausibility heuristic or the role of common sense in judging causation.
- Incorrect: Student does not mention contiguity heuristic or the importance of temporal and spatial proximity.
- Incorrect: Student does not mention similarity heuristic, though they briefly touch on 'similar experiences' this is in wrong context of availability heuristic.

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Social media relies on algorithms to increase how long users stay engaged. This, however, leads to "bubbles" of information that emphasize specific viewpoints and opinions. As a result, participation in this setting is influenced by availability bias. Moreover, depending on an individual's background and knowledge, they may exhibit hindsight bias about topics they are less acquainted with.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions availability bias but does not identify or explain the negativity bias, which is a key component of the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies availability bias as one of the contributing factors, though they don't fully explain how it works in estimating frequency based on ease of recall.
- Incorrect: The student does not explain the connection between negativity bias and availability heuristic in causing overestimation of moral outrage. Instead, they discuss filter bubbles and hindsight bias, which are not part of the answer key.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

A disliked individual can trigger negative feelings and remind someone of past traumas. As a result, the person might avoid certain objects to protect themselves from becoming like the individual they dislike, which acts as a type of dissociation.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student discusses psychological mechanisms like negative feelings, trauma, and dissociation, but fails to identify the key concept of domain transfer - that biological contagion principles are being incorrectly applied to social/psychological situations. The answer doesn't mention framework theories or explain how concepts from one domain (biological) are misapplied to another domain (social/psychological).

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

It was noted that delusional conspiracies often occur alongside behaviors resembling schizophrenia. Conspiracy theories emerge from people's lack of trust in the system and the exposure of secrets held by those in authority.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student discusses behavioral correlations and origins of conspiracy theories but does not address the key distinction that delusional conspiracy theories are both irrational beliefs AND not commonly accepted, while non-delusional ones lack one or both of these characteristics.

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

Conspiratorial thinking occurs when an individual’s mind "breaks down" due to exposure to distressing events or information, leading to a breakdown in their worldview as trust disappears. It is strongly associated with schizophrenia, paranoia, and neurological factors.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes conspiratorial thinking as a 'breakdown' due to distressing events, which does not match any of the specific cognitive factors listed in the answer key such as seeing patterns in randomness or believing paranormal phenomena.
- Incorrect: The student mentions schizophrenia and paranoia as associations, but these are not among the cognitive and personality factors specified in the answer key (which includes factors like narcissism, low intelligence, or attributing agency inappropriately).
- Incorrect: The student refers to 'neurological factors' which is too vague and does not correspond to any of the specific factors from the answer key such as low analytical thinking, being male, or believing in simple explanations for complex events.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Several heuristics play a role in this learning process. From my own experience, conditioning is the key element. During practice, trial and error guided subtle adjustments in how I phrased my responses to questions.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student discusses conditioning, trial and error, and adjustments in phrasing responses, which are general learning mechanisms but do not address the specific psychological mechanism by which incorrect answers interfere with learning. The answer key requires identifying source amnesia, proactive interference, or the continued-influence effect as explanations for how initially incorrect answers can later be mistaken for correct ones or interfere with learning the right information.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

Any kind of press can be beneficial. Since people don’t remember everything, selective information is inserted into messages. By exploiting the availability heuristic, repeated exposure to specific statements often leads to what is known as the gaslighting effect, resulting in conditioning.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions 'repeated exposure' which relates to the correct concept, but identifies it as 'gaslighting effect' and 'conditioning' rather than the mere exposure effect or illusory-truth effect. The answer demonstrates some understanding of repetition's psychological impact but fails to identify the specific mechanism asked for in the question.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Depressive disorder alters the body's chemistry, impacting the brain and therefore influencing perception. This leads to a change in thought patterns.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student provides only vague, general statements about depression affecting brain chemistry and thought patterns without addressing the specific question about accuracy of predictions regarding negative events. The answer does not mention that people with depression are MORE accurate due to reduced optimism bias, which is the key point.

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

When the trustworthiness of sensory input diminishes, individuals look for ways to compensate. As a result, relying on prior beliefs (like wisdom or knowledge) helps support the decision-making process.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when sensory information becomes less reliable (described as 'trustworthiness diminishes'), prior beliefs play a greater compensatory role in perception and decision-making. This captures the key concept that decreased sensory reliability leads to increased influence of prior beliefs.

Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

Considering the relationship between pieces of information, a causal model clarifies the cause-and-effect link between past events, establishing a conditional "if A then B" understanding. When availability heuristics come into play, this leads to bias against unfamiliar situations, which results in hindsight bias.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a causal model establishes cause-and-effect relationships between past events, which aligns with the key point about creating a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly attributes hindsight bias to availability heuristics and bias against unfamiliar situations, rather than explaining how causal models make events seem more inevitable than they actually were.

How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Learning shapes conditioning and establishes thinking patterns. This influences the availability heuristic, while the intricate nature of reality leads to bounded rationality. Consequently, hindsight bias is the type of thinking where

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's answer does not address the key concept that newly learned information cannot be avoided when estimating past likelihood judgments.

Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

A person is more prone to use a maximizing decision style. A high level of neuroticism suggests they tend to overanalyze, making them less inclined to accept decisions that are merely satisfactory.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student does not define maximizing as trying to make the best choice, only mentions tendency to use it without explaining what it means.
- Incorrect: The student does not define satisficing as making a good-enough choice, only briefly mentions 'merely satisfactory' decisions without proper definition.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that high neuroticism leads to maximizing decision style, providing reasonable justification about overanalyzing and not accepting satisfactory decisions.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

A standardized rubric would assist in managing the process by outlining criteria such as the inclusion of specific keywords and concepts. With the advancement of AI technology, initial sorting of responses can be completed more quickly than ever. Nonetheless, human oversight and review remain necessary to guarantee the fairness of the evaluation. This also highlights a drawback of open-ended questions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement by proposing a practical solution (standardized rubrics with specific criteria), acknowledging modern tools (AI for initial sorting), recognizing limitations (need for human oversight), and showing critical thinking about trade-offs (noting drawbacks of open-ended questions). The answer is thoughtful and directly addresses the challenge of balancing student engagement with resource constraints.
