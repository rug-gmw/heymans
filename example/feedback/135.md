## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

Individuals initially form moral judgments primarily through intuition, which is an emotional response (System 1). Moral reasoning (System 2) is only employed when there is sufficient time and motivation.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 thinking involves intuition and emotional responses in moral judgment.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 2 thinking involves moral reasoning, though they could have been more explicit about this being rational/deliberative thought.
- Correct: The student clearly indicates that System 1 (intuition/emotion) is dominant by stating that individuals 'primarily' form moral judgments through intuition, with reasoning only employed under specific conditions.

Score: 1.0

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

This is known as the representativeness heuristic. If X appears similar to Y, people tend to assume that X is likely Y. Individuals judge whether something fits into a category by how closely it resembles other members of that category.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive mechanism for this assumption.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that the representativeness heuristic involves estimating likelihood of category membership based on similarity to typical members of that category, which matches the answer key's explanation about resembling stereotypes.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring refers to the phenomenon where the initial information provided acts as a reference point for interpreting subsequent information, which is then adjusted based on this reference. This is related to the primacy effect, where first impressions are heavily influenced by the earliest information received.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as using initial information as a reference point, which aligns with the answer key's description of taking the first piece of information as the starting point.
- Incorrect: The student describes the primacy effect as being about first impressions rather than the tendency to better remember the first piece of information, which is the key distinction in the answer key.
- Correct: The student implicitly demonstrates understanding of the commonality by connecting both concepts to the influence of initial/earliest information, though not as explicitly stated as in the answer key.

Score: 0.6666666666666666

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency of individuals to prefer avoiding losses rather than acquiring equivalent gains. Risk aversion indicates that people generally steer clear of risks, particularly when the situation is presented in terms of potential gains.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies loss aversion as the tendency to prefer avoiding losses rather than acquiring equivalent gains, which matches the answer key's definition.
- Incorrect: The student defines risk aversion as steering clear of risks in gain situations, but misses the key concept that risk aversion is about preferring certainty over uncertainty in general, not specifically about avoiding risks in gain contexts.

Score: 0.5

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias refers to the tendency of people to exaggerate the intensity and duration of their emotional reactions to events, such as a breakup. As a result, they may avoid ending a relationship because they overestimate how unhappy they will feel afterward.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as the tendency to overestimate emotional reactions to future events, which aligns with the answer key's definition of overestimating the impact of future events on future feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly explains that impact bias prevents breakups because people overestimate how unhappy (bad) they will feel afterward, which matches the answer key's explanation.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting refers to individuals' predictions about their future emotional states. A challenge with end-of-life choices is that healthy people often believe they would prefer death over living with illness or disability, which may not actually be the case (known as the disability paradox).

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines affective forecasting as predictions about future emotional states, which matches the answer key's definition of 'predictions about our own future emotional state.'
- Correct: The student accurately explains the importance for end-of-life decisions by describing how healthy people predict they'd prefer death when sick, but this may not match their actual preferences when ill, which aligns with the answer key's second point.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

People tend to undervalue very small probabilities, often acting as if they cannot happen. Conversely, they tend to overvalue low probabilities, such as perceiving a 10 percent chance as 20 percent.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that low probabilities (like 10%) are overestimated, stating people perceive a 10% chance as 20%, which aligns with the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly explains that very small probabilities are undervalued and treated as if they cannot happen, which matches the answer key's point about extremely low probabilities being interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion results in negative utility.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student only states that loss aversion results in negative utility, but fails to capture the key concept that losses are weighted more heavily than equivalent gains, or that the value function is steeper for losses than gains.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory describes how to choose the most beneficial financial option (maximizing utility), but it has significant shortcomings in reflecting real human behavior. Conversely, expected value theory considers personal perspectives, such as the individual worth of something to a person.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student confuses expected value theory with expected utility theory. They incorrectly state that expected value theory considers personal perspectives, when it actually only deals with financial values. Expected utility theory is what considers personal perspectives and non-financial values.
- Incorrect: The student does not address the key difference regarding heuristics, biases, and risk aversion. They mention that expected value theory has shortcomings in reflecting human behavior but do not specifically identify that expected utility theory accounts for risk aversion while expected value theory does not.

Score: 0.0

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

The expected utility model focuses on selecting the option with the highest monetary payoff. The expected value model, on the other hand, incorporates personal preferences or subjective values. The Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT) considers decisions involving several attributes for each alternative. These three models are normative and face significant shortcomings when applied to real human decision-making. Prospect theory, being a descriptive model, accounts for biases and mental shortcuts.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student has confused expected value and expected utility theories. They incorrectly state that expected utility focuses on monetary payoff (which is actually expected value theory) and that expected value incorporates subjective values (which is actually expected utility theory).
- Incorrect: The student has the definitions reversed - they describe expected value theory as incorporating personal preferences/subjective values, when this actually describes expected utility theory. Expected value theory deals with financial outcomes and probabilities.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies MAUT as dealing with decisions involving multiple attributes for each alternative, which aligns with the answer key's description of multiple attributes with utilities and weights.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies prospect theory as a descriptive model that accounts for biases and mental shortcuts (heuristics), which matches the answer key's description of it being behavioral and considering heuristics and biases.

Score: 0.5

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

When information is presented in terms of gains, individuals tend to avoid risk. Conversely, when it is framed around losses, they are more likely to take risks.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion leads to risk-seeking behavior when facing potential losses, which directly addresses how loss aversion decreases risk aversion. The answer demonstrates understanding of the framing effect and its impact on risk preferences.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Classical conditioning involves linking two events that frequently occur together, such as a product and an attractive model. In contrast, operant conditioning involves learning to connect a specific behavior with either a reward or a punishment.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student does not define conditioning as learning associations through covariation. They jump directly to explaining the two types without providing the overarching definition.
- Correct: The student correctly explains classical conditioning as linking two events that frequently occur together, which captures the essence of learning associations when things happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student accurately describes operant conditioning as learning to connect behavior with rewards or punishments, which matches the key point about actions causing consequences.

Score: 0.6666666666666666

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation is the mistaken belief that one event caused another, even though it did not (for example, assuming medication caused a decrease in depression when it didn't). Illusory correlation refers to the perception that two events or variables are related or occur together more often than they actually do.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly distinguishes between illusory causation (mistakenly inferring causation where none exists) and illusory correlation (perceiving correlation where none exists). The medication example effectively illustrates illusory causation, and the definition of illusory correlation accurately captures the concept of perceiving relationships that don't actually exist.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

The first is a script, which refers to knowledge about a highly routine event, such as the typical process of taking an exam (finding your seat, beginning, etc.). The second is a schema, which is specific knowledge related to a category and provides the background information we depend on extensively.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the Dutch healthcare system as a script when it should be a schema. Healthcare system knowledge represents structured knowledge about relationships and concepts, not a sequence of routine behaviors.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies birthday party behavior as a schema when it should be a script. Birthday party behavior involves a sequence of expected actions and social behaviors in a specific situation, which is the definition of a script.

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

Behaviorists use the second approach, which is the logical level of analysis. They do not consider emotions and subjective experiences, which belong to the third level of analysis.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies behaviorists as using the 'logical level of analysis' (which appears to be referring to the design stance), when behaviorists actually adopted the physical stance by focusing on observable stimulus-response mechanisms and rejecting mentalistic explanations.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

The third type (I can't recall the exact name, neither physical nor logical) involves shifting back to a higher psychological level, such as questioning why my friends are upset with me.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student does not identify the design stance as the approach used by evolutionary psychologists. Instead, they provide a vague description of 'the third type' without naming it, and their example about questioning why friends are upset doesn't relate to evolutionary psychology's focus on the adaptive function of psychological processes.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Contingency refers to whether event A always occurs before event B. Plausibility involves assessing if, according to my knowledge, it is reasonable that one event caused the other. Distinction considers whether event B only occurs after event A or if other events can also trigger it. Consistency in time and space means that event B reliably happens within a certain timeframe following event A. Lastly, consistency of cause and effect is exemplified by situations like my leg moving causing a ball to move.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies distinctness/distinction, explaining that it involves whether B only occurs after A or if other events can also trigger it, which matches the answer key's definition.
- Incorrect: The student mentions 'contingency' as whether A always occurs before B, but this doesn't match the answer key's 'consistency' heuristic, which is about B always following A.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies plausibility as assessing whether it's reasonable that one event caused another based on knowledge, which aligns with the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student describes 'consistency in time and space' as temporal reliability, but the answer key defines contiguity as A and B occurring at the same time and location, not just temporal sequence.
- Correct: The student identifies 'consistency of cause and effect' with an example of physical similarity (leg moving causing ball to move), which corresponds to the answer key's similarity heuristic.

Score: 0.6

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

The availability heuristic means that if an example comes to mind quickly, we assume it is very common. The mere-exposure effect means that the more frequently we encounter something, like moral outrage, the more we tend to believe it is true. Combined, these two effects lead us to overestimate how common something actually is.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the availability heuristic and provides an accurate definition that matches the answer key's description of estimating frequency based on ease of recall.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the mere-exposure effect instead of the negativity bias. The mere-exposure effect relates to developing preferences through repeated exposure, not to seeking out negative information like moral outrage.
- Incorrect: While the student attempts to explain how the two biases work together, the explanation is incomplete and incorrect since they misidentified one of the key biases. The connection between negativity bias and availability heuristic is not properly explained.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

Framework theories propose that individuals possess general, shared understandings across various fields such as physics, psychology, and biology. Applying concepts from one area to another leads to what is known as magical contagion.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that magical contagion involves applying concepts from one domain (biology) to another domain (social/psychological), which aligns with the answer key's explanation of incorrectly applying biological contagion concepts to the social domain.

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

Culture and context play a role. What may be considered delusional in one setting might not be seen that way in another. For example, atheism was once viewed as delusional, but it is now widely accepted.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student discusses cultural relativity and provides an example about atheism, but does not address the key distinction that delusional conspiracy theories are both irrational beliefs AND not commonly accepted, while non-delusional ones lack one or both of these characteristics.

Score: 0.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

Recognizing patterns in randomness, offering straightforward explanations for complex issues, and possessing narcissistic traits.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'recognizing patterns in randomness' which matches 'seeing patterns in randomness' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student mentions 'offering straightforward explanations for complex issues' which corresponds to 'believing in simple explanations for complex events' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'possessing narcissistic traits' which matches 'being narcissistic' from the answer key.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Due to source amnesia, we often lose track of the context in which we acquired information. As a result, we may confuse right and wrong answers because the original context is forgotten.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies source amnesia as the key mechanism and accurately explains that it involves forgetting the context of information acquisition. They correctly connect this to confusing right and wrong answers, which directly addresses how incorrect quiz answers can interfere with learning by being mistaken for correct information.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

The mere exposure effect refers to the tendency for individuals to develop a preference for things they encounter frequently.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the mere exposure effect and accurately describes it as the tendency to develop preferences for frequently encountered things, which directly matches the answer key's definition of mere exposure as the tendency to prefer familiar things.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

No, it actually improves their ability. Healthy individuals often view themselves positively, overestimating their level of control and underestimating the likelihood of negative events occurring to them.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that major depressive disorder does not make people less accurate (answering 'No'), and accurately explains that healthy individuals tend to be overly optimistic by underestimating negative events, implying that depressed individuals are more realistic/accurate in their predictions.

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

As a result, individuals rely more heavily on their existing beliefs.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that individuals rely more heavily on their existing beliefs (prior beliefs) when sensory information becomes less reliable, which directly matches the key concept from the answer key.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

The three stages are pre-conventional, conventional, and post-conventional. The first stage involves acting to receive rewards and avoid punishment. The second stage considers laws and the feelings of others. The third stage recognizes that individuals may hold different moral values that could sometimes conflict.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the pre-conventional level and accurately describes it as involving acting to receive rewards and avoid punishment, which matches the answer key's description of focusing on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the conventional level and accurately describes it as considering laws and the feelings of others, which aligns with the answer key's description of focusing on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Incorrect: While the student correctly identifies the post-conventional level, their description of recognizing different moral values that could conflict is incomplete and doesn't capture the key aspect of focusing on abstract principles and values as specified in the answer key.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

Causal models can be understood through cognitive fluency. It is satisfying to recall events as they truly occurred rather than how they might have happened or how we expected them to happen.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student does not define what a causal model is. They mention cognitive fluency and satisfaction in recalling events, but fail to explain that a causal model is a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Incorrect: The student does not explain how causal models contribute to hindsight bias. They mention satisfaction in recalling events 'as they truly occurred' but miss the key point that causal models make events seem more inevitable than they actually were, which is the mechanism behind hindsight bias.

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

People acquire knowledge of what truly occurred. When asked to recall their original belief, it is impossible to ignore the newly obtained information.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that newly acquired knowledge about actual outcomes cannot be ignored when trying to recall original beliefs, which directly captures the core mechanism of hindsight bias described in the answer key.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing involves striving to make the optimal decision, while Satisficing focuses on selecting an option that is sufficiently good. Individuals with high neuroticism tend to prefer Maximizing.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as 'striving to make the optimal decision,' which aligns with the answer key's definition of 'trying to make the best choice.'
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as 'selecting an option that is sufficiently good,' which matches the answer key's definition of 'making a good-enough choice.'
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that individuals with high neuroticism tend to prefer maximizing, which directly matches the answer key's statement.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

First, I would apply social pressure or cues: when students provide feedback to one another, they may participate more to avoid feeling embarrassed in front of their peers. Second, I might use operant conditioning by linking engagement with the material to positive reinforcements beyond just grades. Third, I would employ framing techniques to present interacting with the material as a gain (such as discovering something interesting) rather than a loss (like failing an exam being a significant setback).

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement by applying three specific psychological concepts (social pressure/cues, operant conditioning, and framing effects) to address the practical challenge of promoting student engagement with limited resources. The answer shows thoughtful consideration of how these principles could be implemented in a classroom setting and directly addresses the question's constraints.
