Grade: 8.0

## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

When faced with a moral dilemma, the initial reaction typically comes from System 1, which relies on emotions and instincts. Afterwards, System 2 is often engaged to evaluate or justify the choice. As a result, System 1 plays a leading role in shaping moral judgments.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 relies on emotions and instincts, which aligns with the answer key's description of System 1 as intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student accurately describes System 2 as being used to 'evaluate or justify the choice,' which corresponds to the answer key's characterization of System 2 as reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student clearly states that 'System 1 plays a leading role in shaping moral judgments,' which directly supports the answer key's point that System 1 is more dominant than System 2.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

This is an example of the representativeness heuristic. When A shares characteristics with B, we are inclined to classify A as B, even if we ignore the likelihood of B actually occurring (base rate). Given that fashion models are uncommon, it is unlikely that our colleague is one.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive bias in this scenario.
- Correct: The student accurately explains the representativeness heuristic by describing how similarity to a stereotype leads to classification assumptions, and even demonstrates deeper understanding by mentioning base rate neglect.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

The primacy effect happens when the initial information presented is more memorable than what follows. Anchoring refers to the tendency to rely heavily on the first piece of information encountered about a topic, which serves as a reference point and is only adjusted slightly as new information comes in. People tend to process new information by giving it more importance compared to other details.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as relying heavily on the first piece of information as a reference point, which matches the key point about taking first information as starting point.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as initial information being more memorable than what follows, which aligns with better remembering first information.
- Incorrect: The student does not explicitly identify what anchoring and primacy effect have in common - they don't mention that both involve overreliance on first information.

Score: 0.6666666666666666

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency for individuals to place greater emphasis on avoiding losses than on acquiring gains. Risk aversion, on the other hand, describes the general preference to steer clear of risky situations when possible. The key distinction is that loss aversion involves a consistent desire to avoid losses, whereas people may sometimes seek out risk because it offers a chance for gain. Thus, they are different concepts since taking risks can lead to potential rewards.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves placing greater emphasis on avoiding losses than on acquiring gains, which matches the answer key's definition about weighing losses more heavily than gains.
- Incorrect: The student describes risk aversion as a general preference to avoid risky situations, but fails to capture the key concept that risk aversion is specifically about preferring certainty over uncertainty. The explanation about sometimes seeking risk for potential rewards actually contradicts the definition of risk aversion.

Score: 0.5

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

When anticipating their emotional response to a future event, individuals often exaggerate both the strength and duration of their feelings. In this case, they might overpredict the emotional distress caused by a breakup and believe it will endure far longer than it truly does. As a result, they may opt for the less intense discomfort of staying in an unhappy relationship.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as overestimating both the intensity and duration of future emotional responses to events, which captures the essence of overestimating the impact of future events on feelings.
- Correct: The student accurately explains how impact bias prevents breakups by describing how people overpredict the emotional distress of breaking up, leading them to choose staying in an unhappy relationship over the anticipated severe emotional pain.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting refers to predicting how certain events or circumstances will make us feel down the line. Although we can generally anticipate the type of emotions we'll experience, we often misjudge how strong and how long these feelings will last. It's crucial to remember this when making decisions about end-of-life matters, so we avoid projecting our present feelings onto the future or exaggerating future experiences, such as pain.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies affective forecasting as predictions about future emotional states, which matches the answer key's definition of 'predictions about our own future emotional state.'
- Incorrect: While the student mentions avoiding projecting present feelings onto the future, they don't address the specific point about healthy people predicting they'd prefer to die when sick, but then not actually preferring to die when they become sick.

Score: 0.5

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

People often overestimate small probabilities overall. Yet, when probabilities are extremely low, people tend to believe these events are nearly impossible, leading them to underestimate the likelihood.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people overestimate small probabilities, which aligns with the answer key's point about merely low probabilities being overestimated.
- Correct: The student accurately describes that extremely low probabilities are treated as nearly impossible events, which matches the answer key's point about extremely low probabilities being interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion involves placing greater emphasis on losses than on gains. Because individuals often evaluate outcomes as losses or gains, losses are associated with negative value, indicating that a significantly larger gain is required to offset a loss.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves placing greater emphasis on losses than gains, and explains that losses have negative value while requiring larger gains to offset them. This demonstrates understanding that negative utilities are weighted more heavily than positive utilities, which aligns with the key concept in the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory allows us to evaluate financial decisions, whereas expected utility theory also considers the preferences and desirability of options in non-financial contexts.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory deals with financial decisions while expected utility theory extends to non-financial contexts and preferences, which aligns with the answer key's distinction between financial and non-financial values.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention the key difference regarding heuristics, biases, and risk aversion that distinguishes expected utility theory from expected value theory's purely mathematical approach.

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected value theory is a normative model designed to improve financial decision-making by assessing the value and likelihood of different options. Expected utility theory is also a normative model that helps in choosing between alternatives by taking into account the probability and desirability of each option. Multi-attribute utility theory, primarily normative and similar to expected utility theory, is mainly applied in complex decision-making scenarios involving multiple factors. It assigns weights to evaluate the significance of each factor in the overall utility. Prospect theory is a descriptive model akin to expected utility theory but includes heuristics and biases that influence how people compare options.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as a normative model and mentions assessing value and likelihood of different options, which aligns with the key concept of financial outcomes with probabilities.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected utility theory as a normative model involving probability and desirability of options, which captures the essence of outcomes having utility beyond just financial value.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies multi-attribute utility theory as a normative model for complex decision-making with multiple factors and mentions assigning weights, which matches the key points about multiple attributes with utilities and weights.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies prospect theory as a descriptive model similar to expected utility theory but including heuristics and biases, which accurately reflects its behavioral nature.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

When facing the possibility of a loss, individuals tend to be less cautious about risk and may even pursue risky options in hopes of turning the negative situation into a positive outcome.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion leads people to become less risk averse (less cautious about risk) and even risk-seeking when facing potential losses, which aligns with the key point that loss aversion decreases risk aversion and can make people risk seeking.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning is a response developed through experience in reaction to a stimulus. Classical conditioning arises from noticing that two events happen together in close time and place. Operant conditioning involves recognizing that specific behaviors result in either rewards or punishments.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as learning through experience with stimuli, which aligns with the concept of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as learning when two events happen together in close time and place, which matches the answer key's description of associating things that happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as recognizing that behaviors result in rewards or punishments, which directly corresponds to the answer key's definition of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory correlation occurs when we incorrectly believe that two variables are related, even though they are not. Illusory causation typically arises from a real correlation, but in this case, we wrongly perceive a cause-and-effect relationship that does not exist.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that illusory correlation involves perceiving a relationship between variables that are not actually correlated, and that illusory causation involves incorrectly interpreting a correlation (which may be real) as a causal relationship. This matches the key distinction in the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

The healthcare system is a schema because it represents an overall structure explaining how a specific area of our environment functions. The birthday party is a script because it involves a sequence of culturally accepted actions that are typically carried out, such as bringing a present.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the healthcare system as a schema and provides a good explanation that it represents knowledge about how a specific area functions, which aligns with schemas being about knowledge and relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies birthday party behavior as a script and appropriately explains it involves a sequence of culturally accepted actions, which matches the answer key's description of scripts as social schemas for specific situational behavior.

Score: 1.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

This approach takes a mechanical perspective, focusing solely on how actions are performed or what behaviors are exhibited. It does not explore the underlying reasons for the behavior or the intentions behind the person's actions.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes a mechanical perspective focusing on behaviors without exploring underlying reasons, but fails to identify this as the 'physical stance' from Dennett's framework. Additionally, the explanation doesn't clearly connect to behaviorism's focus on stimulus-response processes that cause stimuli to result in behaviors.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

They take the design perspective, which considers why things are made a certain way and what purpose they serve. In this context, scientists focus on understanding why evolution shaped humans and their characteristics in this specific manner.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance and provides an accurate explanation that this stance considers why things are made a certain way and what purpose they serve, which aligns with the functional approach of evolutionary psychology.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Covariation refers to the occurrence of A and B together. Distinctness means that A appears to cause only B and not C, or that B does not occur without A. Contiguity in space and time indicates that A and B happen simultaneously and in the same location, without time gaps or unrelated effects from other occurrences of A. Plausibility involves the explanation of A causing B being logically and scientifically reasonable. Similarity in cause and effect means that B follows A and closely mirrors it.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: Student mentions 'covariation' which is not one of the five heuristics in the answer key. While they do mention distinctness correctly, they lead with an incorrect heuristic.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies distinctness and provides an accurate explanation that A causes only B and not other events, and that B doesn't occur without A.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies plausibility and accurately explains it as the explanation being logically and scientifically reasonable.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies contiguity in time and space and provides an accurate explanation about simultaneous occurrence in the same location.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies similarity in cause and effect and provides an accurate explanation that B follows A and closely mirrors it.

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

The availability heuristic happens when we judge the likelihood of events by how easily we can remember them. This makes it simpler to think of angry individuals on social media. Negativity bias plays a role because we tend to focus on negative information.

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies negativity bias and explains it as the tendency to focus on negative information, which aligns with the answer key's definition of seeking out or placing more weight on negative information.
- Correct: Student accurately defines availability heuristic as judging likelihood of events by how easily we can remember them, which matches the answer key's definition of estimating frequency based on ease of recall.
- Incorrect: While the student mentions both biases, they don't clearly explain the causal relationship between them - how negativity bias increases attention to outraged content, which then feeds into availability heuristic to cause overestimation.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

Occasionally, concepts from various fields intersect, leading us to assume that principles relevant in one domain also hold true in another. In this case, we take our understanding of biology related to diseases and contagiousness and mistakenly apply it to individuals we dislike because of their character, rather than any illness they may have.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that biological concepts of contagion are being inappropriately applied to the social/psychological domain when avoiding objects from disliked people, demonstrating understanding of cross-domain misapplication of framework theories.

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

Men tend to exhibit lower levels of critical and analytical thinking linked to narcissism.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that being a man is a factor contributing to conspiratorial thinking, which matches the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly mentions low levels of analytical thinking as a contributing factor, which directly corresponds to the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies narcissism as a factor contributing to conspiratorial thinking, which matches the answer key.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

This occurs due to source amnesia, where we forget the origin of our knowledge. We may recall the wrong answers we provided but mistakenly attribute the information to the textbook, leading us to believe that the incorrect answers are correct.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies source amnesia as the key mechanism and accurately explains how forgetting the source of information (that the answer came from their own incorrect guess rather than authoritative material) can lead to mistaking incorrect answers for correct ones.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

the tendency to develop a preference for things simply because they are familiar

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the mere exposure effect, describing it as the tendency to develop preference for familiar things, which matches the answer key's definition of mere exposure as preferring things we are familiar with.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Yes. Individuals with depression are more likely to exhibit a negative bias when applying the availability heuristic, as they tend to dwell on negative events, making these thoughts more accessible and thus influencing their expectations.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that depression makes people less accurate at predictions due to negative bias, when the correct answer is that depression actually makes people more accurate by reducing unrealistic optimism. The student confuses bias with accuracy.

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

The influence grows because it is currently our most dependable source of information.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that prior beliefs have increased influence when sensory information is unreliable, understanding that priors become the 'most dependable source of information' in such situations.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

In the pre-conventional stage, children recognize that prosocial behavior is linked to rewards and punishments, and they act kindly primarily to gain benefits. During the conventional stage, children become aware of rules and laws and begin to consider how their actions impact others, aiming to avoid hurting people's feelings. In the post-conventional stage, they understand that there is a higher moral principle that can sometimes conflict with and take precedence over established rules and laws.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the pre-conventional level as focusing on rewards and punishments, which aligns with the answer key's description of obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as being aware of rules and considering how actions impact others and avoiding hurting people's feelings, which matches the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly describes the post-conventional level as understanding higher moral principles that can override established rules and laws, which aligns with the answer key's description of focusing on abstract principles and values.

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Hindsight bias is influenced by how easily information comes to mind. Once we know the correct answer, it tends to be the most readily available in our memory. Gaining knowledge reinforces this effect by increasing the ease with which related thoughts are activated.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student explains hindsight bias through availability and memory accessibility but misses the key mechanism: that when estimating past likelihood judgments, people cannot avoid incorporating newly learned information. The student focuses on how knowledge affects memory retrieval rather than the inability to ignore new information when reconstructing past beliefs.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing is a decision-making approach aimed at selecting the best and most ideal option. In contrast, satisficing involves choosing a solution that is adequate or satisfactory for the circumstances. Individuals with high levels of neuroticism tend to be perfectionists, which is often linked to a maximizing decision style.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines maximizing as selecting the best/most ideal option, which aligns with 'trying to make the best choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as choosing an adequate or satisfactory solution, which matches 'making a good-enough choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that high neuroticism individuals tend toward maximizing decision style, connecting it through perfectionism which is a valid reasoning pathway.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

I would assess the different grading methods and apply multi-attribute utility theory to determine which option maximizes engagement. If this approach proves too complicated, I would rely on robust satisficing, selecting the alternative that ensures students gain some valuable knowledge, even if their participation is less active.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement by proposing a systematic approach using multi-attribute utility theory to evaluate grading methods for maximizing engagement, and shows thoughtful consideration by including a backup strategy (robust satisficing) if the primary approach becomes too complex. This reflects meaningful application of course concepts to the practical teaching scenario.
