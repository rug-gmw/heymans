## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

System 1 primarily functions to evoke emotional responses to moral dilemmas. System 2 is engaged only when a person lacks a strong moral opinion or is prompted to think logically. In this model, System 1 holds the most influence.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 involves emotional responses, which aligns with the answer key's requirement that System 1 refers to intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student accurately describes System 2 as being engaged for logical thinking, which corresponds to the answer key's definition of System 2 as reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student clearly states that System 1 holds the most influence, which directly matches the answer key's requirement that System 1 is more dominant than System 2.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

The representativeness heuristic refers to our tendency to judge whether someone or something belongs to a particular group based on how closely they resemble the typical members of that group.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process in this scenario.
- Correct: The student accurately explains the representativeness heuristic as judging group membership based on resemblance to typical group members, which matches the answer key's explanation about estimating likelihood based on stereotype resemblance.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring occurs when we create a reference point based on the initial information we encounter. The primacy effect refers to our tendency to focus mainly on the first information we receive when evaluating something. Both concepts share the tendency to cause us to overlook new information.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as creating a reference point from initial information, which aligns with the answer key's definition of taking the first piece of information as a starting point.
- Incorrect: The student describes primacy effect as focusing on first information when evaluating, but misses the key memory component - that it's about better remembering the first piece of information.
- Incorrect: The student identifies a commonality about overlooking new information, but this doesn't match the answer key's point about overreliance on first information. The focus should be on excessive dependence on initial information rather than ignoring subsequent information.

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency to avoid situations where we might lose something, while risk aversion involves avoiding risks overall that could result in negative outcomes.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly defines loss aversion as avoiding situations where losses might occur, rather than the key concept that losses are weighted more heavily than equivalent gains.
- Incorrect: The student defines risk aversion as avoiding risks with negative outcomes, but misses the core concept that it's about preferring certainty over uncertainty regardless of outcome valence.

Score: 0.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias occurs when we exaggerate the intensity and duration of negative emotions we anticipate experiencing after a certain decision or event. This can discourage someone from ending a relationship, as they expect the pain of breaking up to be worse and last longer than the discomfort they currently feel in the relationship.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies impact bias as overestimating future emotional impact, specifically mentioning both intensity and duration of negative emotions, which aligns with the key concept of overestimating the impact of future events on feelings.
- Correct: The student accurately explains how impact bias prevents breakups by describing that people expect the pain of breaking up to be worse than their current relationship discomfort, which matches the answer key's point about overestimating how bad a breakup will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves anticipating how negative our emotions will be before an event occurs. This is significant in end-of-life choices since we may be unable to express our feelings during such times.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student defines affective forecasting as anticipating negative emotions before events, which is too narrow. The correct definition is predictions about our own future emotional state in general, not specifically negative emotions.
- Incorrect: The student mentions inability to express feelings during end-of-life times, but misses the key point about the discrepancy between healthy people's predictions about preferring death when sick versus their actual preferences when they become sick.

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

People tend to overestimate the likelihood of rare events, and there is a distinction between somewhat low and very low probabilities.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people overestimate rare events, which aligns with prospect theory's finding that merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Correct: The student acknowledges there is a distinction between somewhat low and very low probabilities, which corresponds to the difference between merely low probabilities (overestimated) and extremely low probabilities (treated as impossibilities).

Score: 1.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion is felt in a way that is enjoyable, giving it a positive value.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that loss aversion is enjoyable and has positive value. Loss aversion actually means that losses are felt more intensely than equivalent gains, making the value function steeper for losses than gains - the opposite of what the student described.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory focuses solely on monetary value, while expected utility theory considers both monetary and non-monetary factors. Additionally, expected utility theory incorporates risk aversion, which expected value theory ignores.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory focuses on monetary/financial values while expected utility theory considers both monetary and non-monetary factors, which matches the answer key distinction.
- Correct: The student accurately states that expected utility theory incorporates risk aversion while expected value theory ignores it, which aligns with the answer key's point about expected utility considering risk aversion versus expected value not considering heuristics and biases.

Score: 1.0

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected value theory evaluates potential monetary results of a choice by factoring in their likelihoods. Expected utility theory builds on this by including non-monetary outcomes and incorporating risk aversion. Multi-attribute utility theory extends expected utility theory by assigning weights and values to multiple characteristics of each option. Prospect theory also assesses options with weights and values but additionally considers cognitive biases and heuristics.

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies expected value theory as evaluating monetary outcomes with probabilities, which matches the key concept of financial outcomes with probabilities.
- Correct: Student accurately describes expected utility theory as building on expected value theory but including non-monetary outcomes, which aligns with the answer key's mention of subjective utility beyond financial outcomes.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies multi-attribute utility theory as involving multiple characteristics with weights and values, which matches the answer key's description of multiple attributes with utilities and weights.
- Correct: Student accurately describes prospect theory as considering cognitive biases and heuristics in addition to weights and values, which aligns with the answer key's emphasis on heuristics and biases as a descriptive behavioral model.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

It heightens our tendency to avoid risk when there is a possibility of experiencing a loss.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that loss aversion heightens risk aversion when facing potential losses. The answer key indicates the opposite - that loss aversion can actually decrease risk aversion and make people risk-seeking when trying to avoid losses.

Score: 0.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning is the process of creating connections between two elements through experience and repetition. Classical conditioning involves two stimuli that are linked closely in time and place. Operant conditioning occurs when a link is established between a behavior and the following stimulus.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as creating connections/associations through experience, which aligns with learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as linking two stimuli that occur closely in time and place, which matches the answer key's description of learning to associate things that happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as establishing a link between a behavior and a following stimulus, which captures the essence of learning that actions cause consequences (rewards or punishments).

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation occurs when we mistakenly believe that one thing causes another, even though they are only correlated. Illusory correlation happens when we assume there is a correlation between two things when, in reality, none exists.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly distinguishes both concepts: illusory causation as mistakenly interpreting correlation as causation, and illusory correlation as perceiving a correlation that doesn't actually exist. The answer captures the key difference between misinterpreting an existing correlation versus perceiving a non-existent correlation.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

Knowing how the health care system operates is an example of a schema, as it involves understanding how to manage a situation. In contrast, knowing how to act at a birthday party is a script, since scripts pertain to expected behaviors in social settings.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly identifies the healthcare system as a schema but provides an incorrect explanation. They describe it as 'understanding how to manage a situation' rather than recognizing it as knowledge and relationships between things/concepts.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies birthday party behavior as a script and provides an accurate explanation that scripts pertain to expected behaviors in social settings, which aligns with the answer key's definition of social schemas for specific situations.

Score: 0.5

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

They took a physical perspective, focusing solely on the stimuli and the resulting responses as if they were predetermined. Using an intentional perspective, they would have considered people's intentions instead of just their actions. A design perspective involves thinking about the purpose behind how things are made, which is not relevant in this case.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that behaviorists adopted the physical stance and provides accurate reasoning that they focused on stimuli and responses as if predetermined, which aligns with the physical stance's emphasis on mechanical processes. The student also demonstrates understanding by contrasting this with other stances.

Score: 1.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

They adopt a design perspective, which means focusing on the purpose or function of something instead of its intentions or physical characteristics. In this situation, they consider how a behavior serves a useful role and benefits an individual or group.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance/perspective and accurately explains that this involves focusing on function and purpose rather than physical mechanisms or intentions. The explanation demonstrates understanding of how evolutionary psychologists analyze behaviors in terms of their adaptive functions.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Specificity means that B occurs exclusively when A occurs. Plausibility suggests that, intuitively, it is probable for B to follow A. Consistency indicates that B should always happen whenever A takes place. Contingency in space and time requires B to occur near A both spatially and temporally. Similarity between cause and effect means that A and B should appear similar on the surface.

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies specificity (equivalent to distinctness) and explains that B occurs exclusively when A occurs, which matches the key concept that B follows A but not other events.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies consistency and explains that B should always happen when A takes place, which matches the answer key's definition.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies plausibility and explains it as intuitive probability that B follows A, which aligns with the answer key's common sense explanation.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies contiguity (calling it 'contingency') in space and time, explaining that B should occur near A both spatially and temporally, which matches the answer key.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies similarity between cause and effect, explaining that A and B should appear similar on the surface, which matches the answer key's definition.

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

The availability heuristic suggests that people are inclined to believe something based on the examples that immediately come to mind, while confirmation bias refers to the tendency to look for information that supports existing beliefs or hypotheses. On social media, users are more prone to seek and receive content that expresses moral outrage (confirmation bias), and as a result, they are predominantly exposed to this kind of content (availability heuristic).

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies confirmation bias instead of negativity bias. While confirmation bias involves seeking information that supports existing beliefs, the answer key specifically requires negativity bias - the tendency to seek out or place more weight on negative information like morally outraged content.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the availability heuristic and provides an accurate definition, explaining that people estimate frequency based on examples that come to mind easily.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of how the two biases work together - one bias causes exposure to outraged content, which then leads the availability heuristic to cause overestimation. While they use confirmation bias instead of negativity bias, the mechanism described is essentially correct.

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A delusional conspiracy theory is typically not recognized or believed by a particular group, while non-delusional conspiracies are usually accepted by such groups.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student only addresses the 'commonly accepted' criterion but completely omits the 'irrational belief' component, which is equally important in distinguishing delusional from non-delusional conspiracy theories according to the answer key.

Score: 0.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

Having a low socioeconomic background, identifying as male, and possessing narcissistic traits.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: Low socioeconomic background is not listed among the cognitive and personality factors in the answer key.
- Correct: Identifying as male corresponds to 'being a man' from the answer key.
- Correct: Possessing narcissistic traits corresponds to 'being narcissistic' from the answer key.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

The process of creating a starting reference for information and failing to adequately revise it when new information is introduced.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes a general concept about failing to update initial information, but does not identify the specific psychological mechanism of source amnesia (forgetting the source/correctness of information) or related concepts like proactive interference or continued-influence effect that explain how incorrect quiz answers can interfere with learning.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

The process by which individuals become accustomed to something and are naturally drawn to it.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the core concept of mere exposure - becoming accustomed to something and being naturally drawn to it describes the essence of the mere exposure effect, where familiarity breeds preference.

Score: 1.0

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

negative

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The answer 'negative' is too vague and doesn't demonstrate understanding of the key concept that people with major depressive disorder are actually MORE accurate at predictions due to reduced optimism bias, not less accurate.

Score: 0.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

the impact of existing beliefs grows

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that prior beliefs have greater influence when sensory reliability decreases, though expressed more concisely than the answer key.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

Pre-conventional stage involves evaluating actions based on punishments and rewards, viewing behavior as good if it results in a reward and bad if it leads to punishment. Conventional stage occurs when we judge actions according to how others perceive them, considering something good if it is approved by others. Post-conventional stage happens when we rely on our own reasoning, making decisions grounded in our personal principles and ethical beliefs.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the pre-conventional level as focusing on punishments and rewards, which aligns with the answer key's description of obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as judging actions based on others' perceptions and approval, which matches the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly describes the post-conventional level as relying on personal reasoning and ethical principles, which corresponds to the answer key's focus on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model occurs when we are more inclined to identify a cause-and-effect link between two events that actually occurred, rather than between events that were just as likely but did not happen. This leads to hindsight bias by relying on information obtained after the event.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes causal models in terms of identifying cause-effect links between events that occurred vs. didn't occur, but misses that a causal model is fundamentally a coherent narrative explaining how past events are related.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that causal models contribute to hindsight bias, though they explain it through post-event information rather than the specific mechanism of events seeming more inevitable when part of a coherent narrative.

Score: 0.5

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Since we struggle to ignore newly acquired information, it becomes challenging, if not impossible, to evaluate past decisions without considering the knowledge we have now.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that newly acquired information cannot be ignored when evaluating past judgments, which directly addresses the core mechanism of how learning contributes to hindsight bias as described in the answer key.

Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

A person with a maximizing decision style aims to choose the best possible option, while someone with a satisficing decision style looks for a choice that is adequate or satisfactory. He or she is more inclined to use a maximizing decision approach.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as aiming to choose the best possible option, which aligns with the answer key's description of trying to make the best choice.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as looking for a choice that is adequate or satisfactory, which matches the answer key's description of making a good-enough choice.
- Incorrect: The student states that 'he or she is more inclined to use a maximizing decision approach' but fails to specify that this refers to someone who scores high on neuroticism, making the connection unclear and incomplete.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

For students to actively engage with the material, there needs to be a motivating factor. For many, this motivation is achieving a satisfactory grade, while others might enjoy organizing student-created quizzes to test and correct one another. Providing incentives like food, snacks, or possible extra exam points is crucial in this context. This approach helps students link active learning with positive rewards, encouraging them to participate eagerly. Additionally, if a significant number of students engage actively, it can create a positive example that others will be drawn to follow.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement with the question by identifying key motivational factors for student participation (grades, peer interaction), proposing specific strategies (student-created quizzes, incentives like food/extra points), and recognizing the social dynamics of active learning (positive peer influence). The answer shows thoughtful consideration of practical approaches to encourage engagement within resource constraints.
