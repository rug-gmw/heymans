Grade: 7.0

## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

System 1 involves quick decision-making that relies largely on mental shortcuts. It operates with little effort and is influenced mainly by simple emotions. In contrast, System 2 involves careful, deliberate decision-making and allows for self-reflection. System 1 is more prevalent since it is used more frequently and requires less effort.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies System 1 as involving quick, effortless thinking influenced by emotions, which aligns with the answer key's description of System 1 as intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student accurately describes System 2 as careful, deliberate decision-making with self-reflection, which corresponds to the answer key's description of reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student states that System 1 is more prevalent because it's used more frequently and requires less effort, which correctly identifies System 1 as more dominant than System 2.

Score: 1.0

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

The representativeness heuristic involves matching new information to existing mental categories. In this case, we identify someone as a model because she resembles the typical image we have of that category.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process in this scenario.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that the representativeness heuristic involves matching someone to a category based on how well they fit the typical image or stereotype of that category, which is essentially the same concept as described in the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring refers to the initial information we receive about a subject, which serves as a reference point for our thinking and adjustments. The primacy effect involves our tendency to recall the first thing we encountered more vividly than subsequent information, although we can still remember later details.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as the initial information serving as a reference point, which aligns with the answer key's description of taking the first piece of information as the starting point.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as the tendency to recall the first thing encountered more vividly, which matches the answer key's point about better remembering the first piece of information.
- Incorrect: The student does not explicitly identify what anchoring and the primacy effect have in common - the overreliance on first information is not mentioned or clearly implied in their response.

Score: 0.6666666666666666

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the desire to prevent losses, while risk aversion involves the preference to steer clear of uncertain situations.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes loss aversion as 'desire to prevent losses' but misses the key concept that losses are weighted more heavily than equivalent gains. The definition lacks the comparative aspect that is central to loss aversion.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies risk aversion as preferring to avoid uncertain situations, which aligns with the answer key's definition of preferring certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 0.5

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias refers to our tendency to overpredict the intensity of our emotional reactions to events. It relates to affective forecasting, which involves anticipating our future feelings and shaping our actions based on those expectations. For example, we might avoid ending a relationship because we mistakenly believe the emotional pain will be greater than it truly would be.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as the tendency to overpredict the intensity of emotional reactions to events, which aligns with the answer key's definition of overestimating the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Correct: The student accurately explains how impact bias prevents breakups by stating that people avoid ending relationships because they mistakenly believe the emotional pain will be greater than it would actually be, which matches the answer key's point about overestimating how bad a breakup will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves anticipating or selecting our actions based on how we expect to feel later about those choices. When it comes to end-of-life decisions, many individuals make plans in advance, such as regarding euthanasia. However, since these choices are guided by predictions of future emotions, they are often unreliable. This is because people seldom accurately foresee their future feelings, which can lead to regret.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies affective forecasting as predicting future emotional states, though they frame it more broadly as 'anticipating how we expect to feel later about choices' rather than specifically about emotional states.
- Correct: The student captures the key concept that healthy people make advance decisions about end-of-life care but may feel differently when actually facing illness, demonstrating understanding of the reliability issue in affective forecasting for these decisions.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

We often overvalue small chances, yet if the likelihood is exceptionally tiny, we usually consider it as if it doesn't exist.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that small chances are overvalued, which aligns with the answer key point that merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Correct: The student accurately captures that exceptionally tiny probabilities are treated as if they don't exist, which matches the answer key point that extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion means we tend to steer clear of losses because they carry negative value for us.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes loss aversion as avoiding losses due to negative value, but fails to capture the key asymmetry - that losses are weighted more heavily than equivalent gains. The answer doesn't mention the steeper slope for losses versus gains in the value function, which is the central feature of loss aversion in prospect theory.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected utility theory builds on certain ideas from expected value theory but also incorporates non-monetary factors and considers risk aversion.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected utility theory incorporates non-monetary factors, which aligns with the answer key point that expected value theory deals only with financial values whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Correct: The student correctly mentions that expected utility theory considers risk aversion, which matches the answer key point that expected value theory does not consider heuristics and biases whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Score: 1.0

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected Value Theory involves making decisions by calculating and selecting the option with the highest expected monetary outcome, considering gains, losses, and probabilities, assuming complete information. Expected Utility Theory also relies on calculations but chooses the option with the highest utility, incorporating risk aversion and allowing for non-monetary factors, often based on subjective utility. Multi-Aspect Utility Theory (MAUT) determines decisions by summing benefits and risks with assigned weights, carefully balancing gains against losses to assess whether the benefits outweigh the risks. Prospect Theory views decisions through the lens of gains and losses, recognizing inherent biases in how utility and probability are perceived, and incorporates heuristics and biases to choose options that maximize gains and minimize losses.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies Expected Value Theory as involving calculations of monetary outcomes with probabilities, though they add some details about complete information not in the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes Expected Utility Theory as similar to expected value but incorporating subjective utility and non-monetary factors, with mention of risk aversion.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (called 'Multi-Aspect' by student) as involving multiple attributes with weights, though they describe it more as risk-benefit analysis rather than the normative model structure.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies Prospect Theory as incorporating heuristics and biases in decision-making, accurately describing it as focusing on gains/losses and how utility/probability are perceived.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

People tend to dislike losses more than they value gains. When information is presented focusing on potential losses, individuals are more willing to take risks to prevent those losses. Their aversion to risk decreases when the stakes involve greater potential losses.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion leads people to become more willing to take risks when trying to avoid losses, demonstrating understanding that loss aversion can decrease risk aversion and make people risk-seeking in loss contexts.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning is a training method that links behaviors together. Classical conditioning involves forming associations between events that occur simultaneously in the same setting. Operant conditioning focuses on the relationship between a behavior and its consequence, whether a reward or a punishment.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as a method that links/associates behaviors and events, which aligns with the key concept of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as forming associations between events that occur simultaneously in the same setting, which matches the answer key's description of learning to associate things that happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as focusing on the relationship between behavior and consequences (rewards or punishments), which directly corresponds to the answer key's definition of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation refers to a situation where two variables are correlated, but one does not cause the other. In contrast, illusory correlation occurs when it appears that two variables are correlated, but in reality, no such correlation exists, often due to the influence of a third variable.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that illusory causation involves misinterpreting an actual correlation as causation, and that illusory correlation involves perceiving a correlation that doesn't actually exist. The core distinction between the two concepts is accurately captured, though the student adds some additional detail about third variables that wasn't in the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

The Dutch healthcare system operates as a schema, meaning it consists of information we link to it and involves several schemas when considering how to interact or navigate it. In contrast, a script is a sequence of actions used to behave appropriately in familiar social settings, such as how to conduct oneself at a birthday party.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the Dutch healthcare system as a schema and provides an accurate explanation that it consists of linked information and involves multiple schemas for navigation, which aligns with the answer key's emphasis on knowledge and relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies birthday party behavior as a script and accurately explains it as a sequence of actions for appropriate behavior in familiar social settings, which matches the answer key's description of a social schema for specific situational behavior.

Score: 1.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

I believe they approach things from a mechanical perspective, where a specific input leads to a specific, easily observable output.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes a mechanical input-output perspective but doesn't identify this as the 'physical stance' from Dennett's framework, which was specifically requested in the question. While their description captures behaviorist thinking, they failed to use the required terminology.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

They take the intentional stance, considering the reasons and purposes behind why we might act in a particular manner.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the intentional stance instead of the design stance. While evolutionary psychology does consider purposes/functions, the intentional stance specifically refers to attributing beliefs and desires to predict behavior, whereas the design stance focuses on understanding systems in terms of their functional design - which is what evolutionary psychologists do when they analyze psychological processes for their adaptive functions.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

We want our events to be clearly defined and specific, occurring continuously in time and space. The cause-and-effect relationship should seem reasonable and logical, and there must be a resemblance between the cause and effect. Therefore, events a and b should be distinct enough to be considered separate, detailed enough for us to recall and reconstruct them, happen in succession or close proximity, be logically connected, and share enough similarities to be linked together.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student mentions that events should be 'distinct enough to be considered separate' and 'detailed enough', which captures the essence of distinctness/specificity, though not as precisely as the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention consistency - the idea that B should always follow A. They mention succession but not the consistent relationship aspect.
- Correct: The student states that 'the cause-and-effect relationship should seem reasonable and logical' and mentions events should be 'logically connected', which aligns with plausibility.
- Correct: The student mentions events should occur 'continuously in time and space' and 'happen in succession or close proximity', which captures contiguity in time and space.
- Correct: The student explicitly states there 'must be a resemblance between the cause and effect' and that they should 'share enough similarities to be linked together', which matches similarity in cause and effect.

Score: 0.8

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

The negativity bias refers to our tendency to pay more attention to negative emotional material, such as content that provokes moral outrage. The confirmation bias involves focusing on information that supports our existing beliefs, reinforcing our viewpoints. Social media amplifies this by showing us more of what we've previously engaged with, assuming we want to continue seeing similar content, thus reinforcing confirmation bias.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias and explains it as the tendency to pay more attention to negative emotional material, including morally outraged content, which aligns with the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student identifies confirmation bias instead of the availability heuristic. While confirmation bias is related to reinforcing existing beliefs, the answer key specifically requires the availability heuristic, which involves estimating frequency based on ease of recall.
- Incorrect: The student attempts to explain how social media reinforces confirmation bias, but fails to connect how negativity bias and availability heuristic work together to cause overestimation of moral outrage frequency, which is the key mechanism described in the answer key.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

We apply our contagion/disease model and consider how illnesses can transmit via surfaces. However, this model is mistakenly used to analyze the sweater scenario. This represents a conjunction error because one case is biological while the other is psychological, so the same framework is not appropriate for both.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that the biological contagion/disease model is being inappropriately applied to a psychological/social domain scenario. They recognize this as a domain confusion where frameworks from one domain (biological) are incorrectly transferred to another domain (psychological/social).

Score: 1.0

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

Social acceptance determines whether a conspiracy theory is considered delusional. If a conspiracy theory is embraced by society and culture, it is not viewed as delusional. Conversely, if it lacks social and cultural acceptance, it is regarded as delusional. Delusion stems from the lack of such acceptance.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student only identifies social acceptance as the distinguishing factor but misses the crucial element of irrationality. According to the answer key, a conspiracy theory is delusional when it is BOTH irrational AND not commonly accepted - the student omits the rationality component entirely.

Score: 0.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

When individuals perceive patterns in chaos, when they are male, or when they identify causes where none exist.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'perceiving patterns in chaos' which corresponds to 'seeing patterns in randomness' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'being male' which matches 'being a man' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'identifying causes where none exist' which corresponds to 'attributing agency where it does not exist' from the answer key.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

The tendency to remember information presented first.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes the primacy effect, which is about remembering information presented first in a sequence. This does not address how incorrect answers during self-quizzing can interfere with learning through source amnesia, proactive interference, or the continued-influence effect.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

The tendency to favor information that supports one's existing beliefs.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes confirmation bias, which is about favoring information that supports existing beliefs. This does not match the answer key, which requires identifying mere exposure effect (tendency to prefer familiar things) or illusory-truth effect as the mechanism politicians use when repeating statements.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Certainly.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student provided no substantive answer to the question about whether major depressive disorder affects accuracy in predicting negative events. A complete answer should indicate that people with MDD are more accurate due to reduced optimism bias.

Score: 0.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

When the evidence is less reliable, the prior belief is updated to a smaller extent. This results in the prior belief having a stronger and more prominent impact.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly describes the mechanism. They state that 'prior belief is updated to a smaller extent' when evidence is unreliable, but in Bayesian inference, it's the likelihood (sensory evidence) that has less influence when unreliable, not that priors are updated less. The conclusion about priors having stronger impact is correct, but the reasoning is fundamentally flawed.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

Pre-conventional: Decisions are made based on personal feelings about the results. Conventional: Decisions are guided by societal opinions and norms. Post-conventional: Decisions are made thoughtfully, minimizing biases and heuristics through careful reflection.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes pre-conventional level as based on 'personal feelings about results' rather than avoiding punishment or gaining rewards. This misses the key external motivation aspect.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that conventional level involves 'societal opinions and norms,' which aligns with the focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Incorrect: The student describes post-conventional level as 'minimizing biases and heuristics through careful reflection' rather than focusing on abstract principles and values. This describes good decision-making process but not the moral content.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model reflects our perspective on how causation operates in our actions. This leads to hindsight bias because we believe events caused one another and therefore might have been anticipated.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's definition is too vague and focuses on 'our actions' rather than describing a causal model as a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that causal models contribute to hindsight bias by making events seem like they could have been anticipated, which aligns with the concept that events seem more inevitable than they were.

Score: 0.5

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

When we aim to learn, we often review previous actions and experiences, considering decisions and circumstances. This is where hindsight bias appears. While reflecting, we are aware of the results in advance. We cannot disregard this new knowledge, making the outcome appear obvious, as if we could have predicted it all along.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when reflecting on past events, we cannot disregard newly acquired knowledge about the outcomes, which makes those outcomes seem more predictable than they actually were. This demonstrates understanding of how learning contributes to hindsight bias by making it impossible to ignore information we didn't have at the time of the original decision.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

The satisficing decision style focuses on selecting an option that is sufficiently satisfactory. Decisions are made once the outcome meets an acceptable level. In contrast, the maximizing decision style seeks the ideal or best possible choice. This style is closely associated with neuroticism, meaning that individuals with high neuroticism are more likely to adopt a maximizing approach.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as seeking the ideal or best possible choice, which aligns with the answer key's description of 'trying to make the best choice'.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as selecting an option that is sufficiently satisfactory and meets an acceptable level, which matches the answer key's 'making a good-enough choice'.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that individuals with high neuroticism are more likely to adopt a maximizing approach, which directly matches the answer key.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

First, I would consider what matters most to me by predicting the value and weighing its benefits and risks. I want active participation, but since I don’t have the capacity to personally provide feedback or answer every question, I’d need to implement systems that encourage engagement while fitting my limited availability. I’d likely incorporate peer feedback, where students review each other's work, helping them deepen their understanding and gain diverse insights. It’s also crucial to ensure students actually participate by asking questions, providing feedback, and completing assignments. Motivation should involve both rewards and potential losses, as benefits alone often aren’t enough; for example, using grades, pass/fail statuses, extra credit, or additional exam attempts. I might include an optional “opinion question” that factors into grading or pass/fail, prompting students to formulate and support their views, which encourages engagement through critical thinking. If time permits, organized debates could be an enjoyable addition to classes or assignments. Having used many of these methods myself, I believe the key is choosing strategies you genuinely care about and have thoughtfully prepared. Virtually any tool or incentive can work if it effectively motivates students; understanding their motivations and life circumstances is essential for making decisions. Exams could then involve multiple choice, short answers, or AI grading, since much of the learning would already be demonstrated during class and assignments. Personally, I appreciated how last year’s 'Onderzoeksmethoden Theorie & Ethiek' course graded students based on effort, time, and involvement through tiered, stackable assignments. I’ve put a lot of thought into this topic, so sorry for the long response!

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement with the question by providing a comprehensive response that addresses the core challenge of promoting student engagement with limited resources. They offer multiple concrete strategies (peer feedback, grading incentives, opinion questions, debates) and show understanding of pedagogical principles by discussing motivation, student circumstances, and the balance between benefits and risks. The response also includes personal reflection and references to their own educational experiences, indicating thoughtful consideration of the topic.
