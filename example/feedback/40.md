## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

The social-intuitionist model suggests that moral intuition comes from emotions, which are part of system 1. Moral reasoning, linked to system 2, happens only when there is enough time, motivation, a lack of strong intuition, conflicting intuitions, or when someone you care about holds a different intuition. In this model, system 1 is the more dominant influence.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 thinking involves moral intuition and emotions, which aligns with the answer key requirement about System 1 referring to intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student accurately describes System 2 as involving moral reasoning, which matches the answer key requirement about System 2 referring to reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student explicitly states that 'system 1 is the more dominant influence,' which directly satisfies the answer key requirement that System 1 thinking is more dominant than System 2 thinking.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

Representativeness heuristic: this is when you categorize a person or thing into a group based on how closely they match your mental stereotype of that group.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process in this scenario.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that the representativeness heuristic involves categorizing based on how closely someone matches a mental stereotype, which captures the essence of estimating likelihood based on resemblance to category stereotypes.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Primacy effect: the initial information you receive has a much stronger influence on your overall impression. For example, anchoring means that your first impression acts as a baseline or reference point. Both effects share the common idea that first impressions matter more than any information that follows.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as using first information as a baseline/reference point, which aligns with the answer key's description of taking first information as a starting point.
- Incorrect: The student describes primacy effect as initial information having stronger influence on overall impression, but misses the key aspect from the answer key about better remembering first information.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both effects share the common principle that first impressions/information matter more, which matches the answer key's point about overreliance on first information.

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Risk aversion refers to people's preference for certainty over taking risks, while loss aversion describes how individuals experience losses more strongly than equivalent gains. The key distinction is that risk aversion affects how people perceive probabilities, whereas loss aversion impacts their sense of value or utility.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion describes how individuals experience losses more strongly than equivalent gains, which matches the answer key's definition about weighing losses more heavily than gains.
- Correct: The student accurately defines risk aversion as people's preference for certainty over taking risks, which aligns with the answer key's definition of preferring certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 1.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias refers to the tendency of individuals to exaggerate the strength of their future emotions. This bias can discourage people from ending relationships, as they may believe that the emotional distress and unhappiness caused by a breakup will be greater than the discomfort experienced by remaining in the relationship.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies impact bias as the tendency to exaggerate future emotions, which aligns with overestimating the impact of future events on feelings.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that impact bias prevents breakups because people overestimate the emotional distress from breaking up, matching the answer key's point about overestimating how bad it will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves allowing your choices to be shaped by how you expect to feel in the future. It is crucial to keep in mind during end-of-life decisions because, due to impact bias, you might exaggerate the intensity of your future emotions, overlook other important factors (focalism), and overestimate how long it takes to recover emotionally (emotional evanescence). These tendencies can all affect your decisions about the end of life.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies affective forecasting as predictions about future emotional states, though they phrase it as 'allowing choices to be shaped by how you expect to feel' which captures the essence of predicting future emotions.
- Incorrect: While the student discusses biases in affective forecasting generally, they don't address the specific end-of-life context from the answer key - that healthy people may predict preferring death when sick, but may not actually prefer it when they become sick.

Score: 0.5

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

Yes, this does differ because, according to prospect theory, people tend to view extremely low probabilities (such as 0.01%) as almost impossible, whereas low probabilities (around 10%) are often overvalued.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that low probabilities (around 10%) are overvalued/overestimated according to prospect theory.
- Correct: The student correctly explains that extremely low probabilities (0.01%) are viewed as almost impossible, which aligns with the answer key's point about them being interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the stronger emotional impact of losses compared to equivalent gains, which implies that in prospect theory, it falls below expected utility theory on the subjective scale.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly identifies that losses have stronger impact than gains, but fails to explain this in terms of utility weighting or the steepness of the value function. The phrase about 'falling below expected utility theory on the subjective scale' is unclear and doesn't address how loss aversion is expressed in prospect theory's utility framework.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected utility theory also accounts for risk aversion as well as non-monetary choices and results.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected utility theory deals with non-monetary choices, which aligns with the answer key point about expected utility handling non-financial values versus expected value theory dealing only with financial values.
- Correct: The student correctly mentions that expected utility theory accounts for risk aversion, which matches the answer key point about expected utility theory considering risk aversion while expected value theory does not consider heuristics and biases.

Score: 1.0

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected value model: a prescriptive model used to compute the various values of financial choices. Expected utility model: a prescriptive model that allows calculation of the utilities for different options, which are not necessarily financial. Multi-attribute utility model: primarily a prescriptive model used to evaluate options that consist of multiple attributes, each with different probabilities and utilities. Prospect theory: a descriptive model that incorporates biases and heuristics (mental shortcuts) in decision-making involving options with varying probabilities and utilities.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as a prescriptive/normative model for financial choices, capturing the essence of the model dealing with financial outcomes and probabilities.
- Correct: The student accurately describes expected utility theory as prescriptive and extending beyond financial outcomes to include subjective utilities, which matches the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly mentions 'probabilities' in multi-attribute utility theory. This model deals with multiple attributes with utilities and weights, not probabilities.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies prospect theory as a descriptive model that incorporates biases and heuristics, accurately distinguishing it from the normative models.

Score: 0.75

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Since individuals experience losses more deeply than equivalent gains, they develop loss aversion, meaning they strive to avoid losses. As a result, this loss aversion leads to greater risk aversion.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that loss aversion leads to greater risk aversion. According to the answer key, loss aversion actually decreases people's tendency to be risk averse and can make them risk-seeking when trying to avoid potential losses.

Score: 0.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning is a mental process in which learning occurs. Classical conditioning involves forming connections between two stimuli, while operant conditioning is learning that happens through the use of rewards and punishments.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as a learning process, which aligns with the key concept of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as forming connections between two stimuli, which captures the essence of learning associations when things happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning through rewards and punishments, which matches the answer key's description of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

The difference is that illusory causation involves mistakenly thinking one event causes another when it does not, whereas illusory correlation is the belief that a certain outcome is probable when, in fact, it is not.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly identifies that illusory causation involves mistakenly thinking one event causes another, but incorrectly defines illusory correlation as being about probability of outcomes rather than perceiving correlations between variables that don't actually correlate.

Score: 0.0

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

A schema gives an individual guidance on the appropriate way to act in specific circumstances. Therefore, the Dutch healthcare system is a schema because it offers information on correct behavior, while a birthday party is considered a script since it represents a widely recognized social and cultural schema.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the healthcare system as a schema based on behavioral guidance, when it should be identified as a schema because it represents knowledge structures and relationships between concepts, not behavioral scripts.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the birthday party as a script because it's a 'cultural schema' rather than understanding that it's a script because it provides sequential behavioral expectations for a specific social situation.

Score: 0.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

The intentional stance involves explaining an action by considering the person's intentions behind it. You cannot apply the physical or design stance to behavior because it is not possible to evaluate someone's actions based on their physical characteristics or design features.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies behaviorists as adopting the intentional stance, when they actually adopted the physical stance. Behaviorists explicitly rejected mental states and intentions, focusing instead on observable stimulus-response relationships as physical processes. The student also misunderstands how the physical stance can apply to behavior.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

The design stance is used because evolutionary psychologists aim to explain the purpose or usefulness of a trait, such as the advantage of ingroup favoritism.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the design stance and provides accurate reasoning that evolutionary psychologists explain psychological processes in terms of their purpose/function/usefulness, which aligns perfectly with the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Similar in cause and effect: performing action X results in A, but performing X can also result in B. Plausible: according to my understanding, it is reasonable to think that A leads to B. Contingency in time and place: B occurs right after A, in the same setting. Distinct (specific): B consistently follows A, but does not follow any other event. Consistency: B always occurs after A, regardless of circumstances.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies distinctness/specificity as B following A but not other events, matching the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly describes consistency as B always occurring after A, which aligns with the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly explains plausibility as it being reasonable to think A leads to B, matching the answer key's common sense criterion.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies contiguity in time and space as B occurring right after A in the same setting, matching the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student misunderstands similarity in cause and effect, describing it as performing action X resulting in both A and B, rather than A and B superficially resembling each other.

Score: 0.8

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Negativity bias leads us to engage more with emotionally negative content, while the availability heuristic causes us to judge the likelihood of an event based on how easily we can recall examples. These two effects combine to make us overestimate the frequency of moral outrage on social media, since our frequent exposure to negative posts makes such examples more readily come to mind.

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies negativity bias and explains it as the tendency to engage more with emotionally negative content, which aligns with the answer key's description of seeking out or placing more weight on negative information like morally outraged content.
- Correct: Student accurately describes the availability heuristic as judging likelihood based on how easily examples can be recalled, which matches the answer key's definition of estimating frequency based on ease of bringing examples to mind.
- Correct: Student demonstrates understanding of how the two biases work together - negativity bias increases exposure to negative posts, which through availability heuristic makes moral outrage seem more frequent, effectively explaining the causal relationship described in the answer key.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

Framework theories are general and intuitive concepts about how the world operates. Magical contagion occurs when understanding from one area is applied to a different one. For example, biological knowledge (such as a virus being able to transmit through contact when someone is ill) is extended to magical contexts (believing that a person you dislike can transfer their "negative feelings" like germs to an object).

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that magical contagion involves applying biological domain knowledge (contagion/transmission concepts) to social/psychological domains, and provides a clear example of how negative qualities are believed to transfer through contact with objects, demonstrating understanding of cross-domain misapplication.

Score: 1.0

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

It doesn’t venture into the territory of magic.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's answer about 'magic' does not address the key distinction in the answer key, which is that delusional conspiracy theories are both irrational beliefs and not commonly accepted, while non-delusional ones lack one or both of these characteristics.

Score: 0.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

being male, having a low level of education, perceiving patterns where none exist

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'being male' as a factor, which matches 'being a man' from the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student mentions 'having a low level of education' but the answer key specifies 'having a low level of intelligence' and 'having a low level of analytical thinking', not education level.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'perceiving patterns where none exist' which matches 'seeing patterns in randomness' from the answer key.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Hindsight bias is when you believe you predicted the outcome all along, even though you actually didn't.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes hindsight bias, which is about falsely believing you predicted an outcome after knowing the result. This doesn't address how incorrect quiz answers interfere with learning. The answer key requires explaining source amnesia (forgetting the incorrectness of your answer), proactive interference, or the continued-influence effect.

Score: 0.0

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

Classical conditioning occurs because the repeated exposure causes people to link the message with the politician, leading those who support the politician to eventually develop a positive feeling toward the message.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes classical conditioning rather than the mere exposure effect or illusory-truth effect. While the answer mentions repeated exposure, it incorrectly focuses on associative learning between politician and message rather than the psychological mechanisms of familiarity breeding preference (mere exposure) or repeated statements seeming more truthful (illusory-truth effect).

Score: 0.0

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Yes, individuals with major depressive disorder lack a positivity bias, meaning that positive information impacts their predictions more than negative information does.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that people with major depressive disorder lack a positivity bias and that positive information impacts their predictions more than negative information. This contradicts the answer key - people with depression are actually more accurate because they have reduced optimism bias (less tendency to be overly optimistic), not because positive information has more impact.

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

When sensory information becomes less reliable, prior beliefs have a stronger effect on perception, causing perception to lean more towards those prior beliefs.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when sensory information becomes less reliable, prior beliefs have a stronger influence on perception, which directly matches the key concept from the answer key.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

Pre-conventional: understanding is based on rewards and punishments, with an emphasis on oneself. Conventional: emphasis is placed on gaining approval from others. Post-conventional: recognizing that moral principles may sometimes conflict, and embracing universal ethical values.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the pre-conventional level as being based on rewards and punishments with self-focus, which aligns with the answer key's description of obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as emphasizing gaining approval from others, which corresponds to the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the post-conventional level as involving universal ethical values and recognizing conflicts between moral principles, which matches the answer key's description of focusing on abstract principles and values.

Score: 1.0

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model of past events suggests that individuals attempt to understand the past through mental ease or cognitive fluency. This leads to hindsight bias because the causal model causes you to create a narrative of the past, making it appear as if the outcome was predictable all along, even though it actually wasn't.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly defines a causal model as related to 'mental ease or cognitive fluency' rather than as a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student correctly explains that causal models contribute to hindsight bias by creating narratives that make outcomes appear predictable/inevitable when they weren't.

Score: 0.5

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

You can’t evaluate past events using the knowledge you have now, because once you learn something new, you can’t unlearn it to assess the situation as you did originally. With hindsight, you always possess more information than you did at the time, making it seem like you anticipated the outcome all along.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly explains that newly learned information cannot be avoided when estimating past judgments, and demonstrates understanding that this additional knowledge makes outcomes seem more predictable in retrospect. This captures the core mechanism of how learning contributes to hindsight bias.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing involves seeking the optimal choice, while satisficing means choosing an option that is good enough. Individuals with high levels of neuroticism are more prone to use the maximizing approach when making decisions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as 'seeking the optimal choice' which aligns with 'trying to make the best choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as 'choosing an option that is good enough' which matches 'making a good-enough choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that individuals with high neuroticism are 'more prone to use the maximizing approach' which matches the answer key's statement about adopting the maximizing decision style.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

I would tackle this by using a nudge—a gentle push toward the preferred choice. Nudges can be applied by enhancing accessibility, leveraging social influence, setting default options, and using classical conditioning. When I am actively involved, accessibility improves significantly, encouraging people to engage with the material.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement with the question by proposing a specific behavioral intervention approach (nudging) and explaining how it could be applied in an educational context. They identify concrete mechanisms (accessibility, social influence, defaults, classical conditioning) and connect these to student engagement, showing thoughtful consideration of how to encourage active participation with limited resources.
