## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

Intuition corresponds to system 2, while emotional responses are linked to system 1. System 1 is more influential since our intuition is largely shaped by our emotional reactions.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that intuition corresponds to System 2, when according to Haidt's model, System 1 thinking refers to intuitions/emotions.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly assigns emotional responses to System 1 while placing intuition in System 2, but fails to identify System 2 as reasoning/rational thought.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 is more dominant/influential in moral judgment according to Haidt's model.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

Representative heuristic involves assuming that someone belongs to a particular group because they share similar traits, without taking into account the actual number of people in that group, such as the limited number of fashion models. This reflects base-rate neglect.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process, which matches the first point in the answer key.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of the representativeness heuristic by explaining that it involves assuming group membership based on shared traits/similarity, which aligns with the answer key's explanation about estimating likelihood based on resemblance to stereotypes. The additional mention of base-rate neglect shows deeper understanding of the concept.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring refers to the initial information you receive and use as a reference point, while the primacy effect means that this first information has an unusually strong impact on your perception of any subsequent information.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as using initial information as a reference point, which aligns with the answer key's definition of taking the first piece of information as the starting point.
- Incorrect: The student describes the primacy effect as first information having strong impact on subsequent information perception, but the answer key specifically defines it as the tendency to better remember the first piece of information.
- Incorrect: The student does not explicitly address what anchoring and the primacy effect have in common, missing the key point about overreliance on first information.

Score: 0.3333333333333333

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion means we place greater importance on avoiding losses than on acquiring gains, while risk aversion means we favor certainty instead of taking chances.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves placing greater importance on avoiding losses than on acquiring gains, which matches the answer key's definition of weighing losses more heavily than gains.
- Correct: The student accurately describes risk aversion as favoring certainty instead of taking chances, which aligns with the answer key's definition of preferring certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 1.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias refers to our tendency to exaggerate how much a future choice will affect us. For example, when considering a breakup, people often overestimate how much it will impact them, leading them to remain in an unsatisfying relationship.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as the tendency to exaggerate how much a future choice will affect us, which captures the essence of overestimating the impact of future events on our feelings.
- Correct: The student accurately explains how impact bias prevents breakups by stating that people overestimate how much a breakup will impact them, causing them to stay in unsatisfying relationships.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves making choices based on predictions about future emotions. For example, healthy individuals might believe they would choose to end their life if they became ill, but in reality, when they do become sick, they often still wish to continue living. This is significant because when people become ill, they may lose the ability to communicate their wishes, making decisions about ending life challenging due to the inaccuracies of affective forecasting.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies affective forecasting as making predictions about future emotions, which aligns with the answer key's definition of 'predictions about our own future emotional state.'
- Correct: The student accurately describes the key example from the answer key - that healthy people may predict they'll prefer to die when sick, but when actually sick, they often still want to live.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

Yes. People tend to overvalue small probabilities around 10%, while they undervalue very tiny probabilities like 0.01%. They often perceive these extremely low chances as absolute certainties that the event will not occur.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people overestimate merely low probabilities (around 10%), which aligns with the answer key point about overestimation of low probabilities.
- Correct: The student accurately describes that extremely low probabilities (0.01%) are treated as 'absolute certainties that the event will not occur,' which matches the answer key point about extremely low probabilities being interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

In prospect theory, loss aversion carries a strong negative impact, leading us to try to prevent losses whenever we can.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes the behavioral consequence of loss aversion (trying to prevent losses) but does not explain what loss aversion reflects in terms of utility - that negative utilities are weighted more heavily than positive utilities or that the value function is steeper for losses than gains.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory focuses solely on financial results, whereas expected utility theory takes into account both financial and non-financial outcomes. Additionally, expected utility theory incorporates risk aversion, which is not addressed by expected value theory.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory focuses on financial results while expected utility theory considers both financial and non-financial outcomes, which matches the first point in the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly states that expected utility theory incorporates risk aversion while expected value theory does not, which aligns with the second point in the answer key about considering heuristics and biases.

Score: 1.0

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

1. Expected value theory is a normative approach that applies solely to financial outcomes. 2. Expected utility theory is a normative model that covers both financial and non-financial outcomes and takes risk aversion into account. 3. Multi-attribute utility theory is a normative framework that evaluates multiple different factors, each with its own value and utility, making it helpful for decisions involving various aspects. 4. Prospect theory is a descriptive model that builds on the expected utility framework, incorporating biases and heuristics, and is useful for explaining human behavior.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as a normative model dealing with financial outcomes, which aligns with the answer key's description of financial outcomes with probabilities.
- Correct: The student accurately describes expected utility theory as a normative model covering both financial and non-financial outcomes, which matches the answer key's explanation of utilities that can be subjective rather than just financial.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies multi-attribute utility theory as a normative framework evaluating multiple factors with their own values, which corresponds to the answer key's description of multiple attributes with utilities and weights.
- Correct: The student accurately describes prospect theory as a descriptive model that builds on expected utility theory while incorporating biases and heuristics, which matches the answer key's characterization as a behavioral model similar to expected utility theory but with heuristics and biases.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

When faced with potential losses, individuals tend to become less risk-averse and are more inclined to take greater risks to prevent those losses.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion makes people less risk-averse when facing potential losses, and accurately states that people become more willing to take risks to avoid losses, which matches the key concept that loss aversion can decrease risk aversion and make people risk seeking.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves learning associations by noticing how things vary together. Operant conditioning is learning based on consequences like rewards and punishments. Classical conditioning involves repeatedly experiencing the same pairings.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as learning associations through covariation, using equivalent language ('noticing how things vary together').
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as involving repeated pairings, which captures the essence of learning associations when things happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning based on consequences like rewards and punishments, matching the answer key's description of actions causing rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation is the mistaken belief that one event causes another when they are only correlated, while illusory correlation is the false perception that two variables are related when they actually are not.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly distinguishes between illusory causation (misinterpreting correlation as causation) and illusory correlation (perceiving correlation where none exists). The definitions align well with the answer key, capturing the essential difference between these two cognitive biases.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

The healthcare system is a schema because it represents shared knowledge that we can recognize and apply in everyday situations, while a birthday party is a script since it is a socially and culturally established routine event.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the healthcare system as a schema and provides a reasonable explanation that it represents shared knowledge applicable to everyday situations, which aligns with the concept of schemas as knowledge structures.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the birthday party as a script and explains it as a socially and culturally established routine event, which captures the essence of scripts as behavioral sequences for specific situations.

Score: 1.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

The design stance involves observing how individuals behave and respond in a specific context, focusing on the tangible elements.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the design stance instead of the physical stance. The design stance focuses on function and purpose, while behaviorists actually adopted the physical stance by focusing on observable stimulus-response mechanisms and rejecting mentalistic explanations.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

The intentional stance involves taking into account the thoughts and intentions driving our actions. We exhibit ingroup favoritism because we understand that having a supportive community is advantageous for us.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the intentional stance instead of the design stance. While they show some understanding of evolutionary psychology's functional approach, they misapply Dennett's levels of analysis by focusing on conscious intentions rather than the design/functional perspective that evolutionary psychologists actually adopt.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Plausibility: you can examine the events by checking if B still happens when A is removed. Consistency: whenever A takes place, B always occurs. Specificity: B happens only when A causes it. Continuity in time and space: wherever A happens, B follows. Similarity in cause and effect: event A is consistent each time, and event B is also consistent each time.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes specificity correctly as 'B happens only when A causes it' but confuses plausibility with experimental manipulation (removing A to see if B still happens), which is not the correct definition of plausibility as common sense reasonableness.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies consistency as 'whenever A takes place, B always occurs,' which matches the answer key's definition.
- Correct: The student correctly describes specificity/distinctness as 'B happens only when A causes it,' which aligns with the answer key's concept that B follows A but not other events.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies contiguity in time and space as 'wherever A happens, B follows,' capturing the essence of temporal and spatial proximity.
- Incorrect: The student misunderstands similarity in cause and effect, describing it as consistency of individual events rather than superficial resemblance between cause A and effect B.

Score: 0.6

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Negativity bias means that negative emotions or experiences influence our thinking more strongly, causing us to recall negative events more clearly than neutral or positive ones. The availability heuristic is when we assume that things that are easier to remember are more common or frequent. Because negative events are more readily brought to mind, we tend to overestimate their actual occurrence.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias and explains it as negative emotions/experiences influencing thinking more strongly, which aligns with the answer key's description of seeking out or placing more weight on negative information.
- Correct: The student accurately defines the availability heuristic as assuming things that are easier to remember are more common or frequent, which matches the answer key's definition of estimating frequency based on ease of recall.
- Correct: The student successfully connects how the two biases work together - negativity bias makes negative events more readily brought to mind, which through availability heuristic leads to overestimating their occurrence, matching the answer key's explanation of the mechanism.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

Framework theories are general, intuitive understandings of how to make sense of the world. Transfer effects occur when knowledge from one area influences another. The traits of a person you dislike can influence your perception of the objects associated with them, as those items are linked to the individual.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that this is a transfer effect where knowledge from one domain (biological contagion - the idea that negative traits can transfer through contact) is being applied to another domain (social/psychological - avoiding objects associated with disliked people). While they don't explicitly name the biological domain, they demonstrate understanding that framework theories from one area are being inappropriately applied to explain social phenomena.

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A delusional conspiracy theory is not embraced or recognized by society and culture.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student only identified one criterion (not commonly accepted by society) but missed the other essential criterion that the belief must also be irrational. The answer key requires both conditions: irrational belief AND not commonly accepted.

Score: 0.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

Recognizing patterns in randomness, having lower levels of education, and exhibiting narcissistic traits.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identified 'recognizing patterns in randomness' which matches 'seeing patterns in randomness' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student mentioned 'having lower levels of education' which aligns with 'having a low level of intelligence' from the answer key, as both relate to cognitive limitations.
- Correct: The student correctly identified 'exhibiting narcissistic traits' which directly corresponds to 'being narcissistic' from the answer key.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Primacy effect refers to the tendency for the initial information you consider as the correct answer to strongly influence your memory, making it hard to remove from your thought process and potentially hindering further learning.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the primacy effect as the mechanism. While primacy effect does relate to initial information being remembered better, it doesn't specifically explain how incorrect answers interfere with learning the correct ones. The answer key requires explanation of source amnesia (forgetting the incorrectness of initial answers), proactive interference (initial incorrect answers interfering with later correct ones), or the continued-influence effect.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

through mental ease

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's answer 'mental ease' does not identify the specific psychological mechanism. While mental ease might be a general consequence of repeated exposure, the answer key requires identification of 'mere exposure effect' or 'illusory-truth effect' as the specific mechanisms politicians use when repeating statements.

Score: 0.0

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Yes, people tend to overestimate the chances of something bad happening to them. This can be attributed to negativity bias, which makes us remember negative experiences more strongly because they trigger a greater emotional reaction compared to neutral or positive events.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that people overestimate bad outcomes and attributes this to negativity bias. The answer key indicates that non-depressed people are actually overly optimistic (underestimate bad outcomes), while people with major depressive disorder are more accurate because they have reduced optimism bias. The student's response contradicts the key concept and doesn't address depression's effect on prediction accuracy.

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

Your perception is more influenced by prior beliefs than by sensory information because the sensory information is unreliable.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when sensory information is unreliable, prior beliefs have greater influence on perception, which directly matches the key concept from the answer key.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

Pre-conventional level: centered on gaining rewards, evading punishment, and personal benefit. Conventional level: centered on seeking social acceptance and following rules and laws. Postconventional level: centered on universal ethical principles, recognizing that personal morals may differ from those of others.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the pre-conventional level as focusing on gaining rewards and avoiding punishment, which matches the answer key's description of obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as centered on seeking social acceptance and following rules and laws, which aligns with the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the post-conventional level as centered on universal ethical principles, which matches the answer key's description of focusing on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

We create stories about past events to help us remember them better. This leads to hindsight bias because when we reflect on an event, the story quickly comes to mind, making us feel like we predicted it beforehand, even though we did not.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that causal models are stories/narratives about past events, capturing the essence of how we create coherent explanations for what happened.
- Incorrect: The student misunderstands the mechanism - they describe feeling like we predicted events beforehand, but the key point is that causal models make past events seem more inevitable than they actually were.

Score: 0.5

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

It is impossible to avoid considering what we have learned about a past event when reflecting on it, which creates the illusion that we always knew the outcome, even though we did not.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly explains that newly learned information cannot be avoided when reflecting on past events, which directly matches the key point about being unable to avoid taking newly learned information into account when estimating past likelihood judgments. The student also demonstrates understanding of how this creates hindsight bias.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing involves aiming to select the best possible option, while satisficing means opting for a choice that is good enough. People with high neuroticism are more likely to use a maximizing approach.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as 'aiming to select the best possible option,' which aligns with the answer key's description of 'trying to make the best choice.'
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as 'opting for a choice that is good enough,' which matches the answer key's definition of 'making a good-enough choice.'
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people with high neuroticism are more likely to use a maximizing approach, which directly matches the answer key's expectation.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

I would organize students into groups that meet once a week to collaborate on individual assignments they complete on their own each week. These assignments are brief but meaningful, involving not just written work but also real-world tasks, such as observing how people make decisions in a specific setting. Participants must actively engage with the material and discuss their experiences with the group, allowing for peer feedback and mutual learning. Each student keeps a personal log of their individual activities and submits notes from the group feedback sessions. To pass the course, students are required to submit assignments at least five times over the seven-week period.

Feedback:

- Correct: This answer demonstrates serious engagement with the question by proposing a structured approach that addresses the core challenge of promoting active engagement with limited resources. The response includes specific, practical solutions such as group collaboration, individual assignments with real-world components, peer feedback systems, and clear participation requirements. The student has thoughtfully considered how to balance individual accountability with group learning while maintaining manageable grading demands through submission-based rather than personalized feedback requirements.
