Grade: 8.5

## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidtâ€™s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

The social-intuitionist model suggests that moral judgments are primarily intuitive, meaning people often sense something is morally wrong without a logical reason. System one, which is fast and instinctive, plays the leading role. In contrast, system two, which involves careful and conscious thought, is typically engaged afterward to evaluate whether the initial moral judgment was correct.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies System 1 as 'fast and instinctive' which aligns with the answer key's description of System 1 as intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student correctly describes System 2 as involving 'careful and conscious thought' which matches the answer key's description of System 2 as reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student clearly states that 'System one...plays the leading role' and that System 2 is 'engaged afterward,' indicating System 1's dominance over System 2 as required by the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

The representative heuristic is at play here. Since the coworker resembles a fashion model, it is assumed she is one. This leads to an overestimation of the actual number of models overall, ignoring the base rate.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive bias in this scenario.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of the heuristic by explaining that assumptions are made based on resemblance to a stereotype, though they add extra detail about base rate neglect that goes beyond the core explanation required.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring occurs when the initial value encountered serves as a reference point that can later be modified. The primacy effect refers to how the first impression heavily shapes our overall judgment. Both share the idea that the initial information or observation strongly influences your evaluation or perception. Although further information can lead to adjustments, the first element remains highly influential.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as using initial information as a reference point, which aligns with the answer key's definition of taking the first piece of information as the starting point.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as first impressions heavily shaping judgment, which corresponds to the answer key's point about better remembering first information.
- Correct: The student clearly identifies that both concepts share the characteristic of initial information being highly influential, which matches the answer key's point about overreliance on first information.

Score: 1.0

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion means that individuals place greater importance on avoiding losses than on achieving gains, while risk aversion refers to the preference for certainty rather than facing uncertainty.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves placing greater importance on avoiding losses than on achieving gains, which matches the answer key's definition of weighing losses more heavily than gains.
- Correct: The student accurately describes risk aversion as the preference for certainty rather than facing uncertainty, which aligns with the answer key's definition of preferring certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 1.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias refers to our tendency to exaggerate the emotional impact an event will have. This can lead individuals to avoid ending relationships, as they overpredict how negatively a breakup will affect them, despite being unhappy.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as the tendency to exaggerate the emotional impact of events, which aligns with overestimating the impact of future events on our feelings.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that impact bias prevents breakups because people overpredict how negatively a breakup will affect them, which matches the answer key's point about overestimating how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves anticipating how we will feel about events or situations in the future. Reflecting on your emotions, desires, and needs as you approach the end of your life, and documenting them, can help ensure you receive the kind of care you prefer. For instance, if you predict that being resuscitated would have a negative impact, you can choose to sign a DNR. This helps prevent your life from being extended or made more painful than you wish.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies affective forecasting as predicting future emotional states, though they phrase it as 'anticipating how we will feel about events or situations' which captures the essence of predicting future emotional responses.
- Incorrect: The student does not address the key issue that healthy people may predict they'll prefer to die when sick, but may change their preference when actually experiencing illness. Instead, they focus on advance directives and documentation without discussing the potential discrepancy between predicted and actual preferences.

Score: 0.5

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

People tend to underestimate low probabilities. There is a distinction between just low and extremely low probabilities. When a probability is extremely low, it is often perceived as impossible, causing people to dismiss it more readily than a probability that is simply low.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that people underestimate low probabilities, when prospect theory shows that merely low probabilities are typically overestimated.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that extremely low probabilities are often perceived as impossible and dismissed, which aligns with the answer key.

Score: 0.5

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion means that avoiding a loss is considered more valuable or desirable than achieving a gain.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion means losses are weighted more heavily than gains, though they express it in terms of value/desirability rather than utility steepness. The core concept that losses have greater psychological impact than equivalent gains is captured.

Score: 1.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory focuses solely on monetary outcomes. In contrast, expected utility theory includes risk aversion and can be applied to non-monetary factors by assigning them a utility, which reflects their desirability.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory focuses on monetary outcomes while expected utility theory can handle non-monetary factors through utility assignment, which aligns with the distinction between financial and non-financial values.
- Correct: The student correctly mentions that expected utility theory incorporates risk aversion, which is the key behavioral consideration that distinguishes it from expected value theory's purely mathematical approach.

Score: 1.0

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesnâ€™t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected value theory is a rational decision-making model that relies on monetary value, assigning an expected value to each option based on assumed probabilities and certainties. Expected utility theory extends this by incorporating risk aversion, assigning both a utility (representing desirability) and probability to attributes rather than just monetary values, and can consider multiple factors, still assuming probabilities and certainties. Multi-attribute utility theory addresses scenarios involving several attributes by assigning each a utility and a corresponding weight. Prospect theory takes into account cognitive biases and heuristics, such as loss aversion and distorted perceptions of probabilities.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as a rational decision-making model based on monetary value with probabilities, which aligns with the answer key's description of a normative model with financial outcomes and probabilities.
- Correct: The student accurately describes expected utility theory as extending expected value theory beyond monetary values to include subjective utility and risk aversion, which matches the answer key's explanation of outcomes having utility that can be subjective rather than just financial.
- Correct: The student correctly explains multi-attribute utility theory as addressing scenarios with multiple attributes, each having utility and weight, which directly corresponds to the answer key's description.
- Correct: The student properly identifies prospect theory as incorporating cognitive biases and heuristics like loss aversion, which aligns with the answer key's description of it being a descriptive behavioral model that considers heuristics and biases.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease peopleâ€™s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

People naturally tend to avoid risk. Loss aversion means that individuals give more importance to losses than to gains. When a situation is presented as a potential loss, people may become more willing to take risks in order to avoid that loss.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion can make people more willing to take risks when trying to avoid losses, which demonstrates understanding that loss aversion can decrease risk aversion in loss domains.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves learning through the relationship between events. Classical conditioning is the process of learning associations by frequently experiencing two things together. Operant conditioning, on the other hand, is learning through the use of rewards and punishments.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as learning through relationships between events, which aligns with the concept of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as learning associations by experiencing two things together frequently, which matches the answer key's description of learning to associate things that happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning through rewards and punishments, which corresponds to the answer key's point about learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation occurs when individuals believe that one event causes another, even though no such connection exists, while illusory correlation happens when people perceive two events as often occurring together when they actually do not.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly distinguishes between illusory causation (perceiving causal relationships that don't exist) and illusory correlation (perceiving correlations that don't exist). While the wording differs from the answer key, the core concepts are accurately captured - illusory causation involves false causal inference while illusory correlation involves false perception of co-occurrence.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to â€˜properlyâ€™ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

The Dutch healthcare system serves as a general structure, offering a quick overview of its functioning based on previous experiences and is more comprehensive. In contrast, a script for a birthday party outlines specific behaviors for a particular event or situation and is culturally specific.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the Dutch healthcare system as a schema and provides appropriate reasoning, describing it as a 'general structure' that is 'comprehensive' and based on 'previous experiences,' which aligns with schemas being knowledge structures about relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies birthday party behavior as a script and provides good reasoning, describing it as outlining 'specific behaviors for a particular event or situation' that is 'culturally specific,' which matches the definition of scripts as social schemas for specific situational behavior.

Score: 1.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

A physical stance explains behavior from a purely physical perspective, focusing on the biological processes and how stimuli trigger actions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that behaviorists adopted the physical stance and provides accurate reasoning - they focused on how stimuli trigger behavior from a physical/biological process perspective, which aligns with the answer key's explanation about focusing on processes that cause stimulus-behavior relationships.

Score: 1.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

From a design perspective, they interpret behavior based on its purpose.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance and accurately explains that they interpret behavior based on its purpose/function, which aligns with the answer key's emphasis on considering psychological processes in terms of their function.

Score: 1.0

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Distinction: event A directly leads to event B. Continuity: event B consistently follows event A. Plausibility: according to general knowledge, it makes sense that event A would cause event B. Contiguous in time and space: event A results in event B even if they happen at different times and places. Unfortunately, I cannot recall the fifth one.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'Distinction' (close to 'Distinctness') and explains it as A directly leading to B, which captures the essence of specificity where B follows A but not other events.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'Continuity' (equivalent to 'Consistency') and accurately explains it as B consistently following A, which matches the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'Plausibility' and provides an accurate explanation that it should make sense according to general knowledge that A would cause B.
- Incorrect: The student misunderstands contiguity - they say A results in B 'even if they happen at different times and places,' which is the opposite of the correct definition that requires A and B to occur at the same time and location.
- Incorrect: The student explicitly states they cannot recall the fifth heuristic (similarity in cause and effect), so this point is not addressed.

Score: 0.6

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

People tend to focus on and seek out negative information due to negativity bias. Social media posts expressing moral outrage often contain highly negative emotions, which attract greater engagement. As a result, these posts are shared more frequently and become more accessible to users. The availability heuristic leads people to judge the likelihood of events based on how readily they can recall examples; thus, frequent exposure to moral outrage makes it seem more common than it actually is.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias and explains it as the tendency to focus on and seek out negative information, which aligns with the answer key's definition.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the availability heuristic and accurately describes it as judging likelihood based on how readily examples can be recalled, matching the answer key's explanation.
- Correct: The student clearly explains the connection between the two biases: negativity bias causes attention to moral outrage content, which increases exposure and makes examples more accessible, leading the availability heuristic to cause overestimation of moral outrage frequency.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

A framework theory is a general and widely accepted understanding used to interpret the world. It has three aspects: physics, design, and intention. The physics perspective suggests that since the sweater belonged to someone else, any negative feelings toward that person extend to the sweater. The design perspective focuses on the purpose or function, meaning avoiding the sweater serves the function of steering clear of association with the disliked person. The intentional perspective considers the thoughts and motives behind actions, explaining that we avoid wearing the sweater because we have negative feelings toward its previous owner.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly describes framework theories as having three aspects (physics, design, and intention) and applies these to explain the contagion example, but fails to identify that this is specifically about the biological concept of contagion being misapplied to the social/psychological domain, which is the key point in the answer key.

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A delusional conspiracy theory is one that is not recognized or accepted by society and is often clearly false. In contrast, a non-delusional theory is one that society accepts.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student only identifies social acceptance as the distinguishing factor but misses the crucial element of irrationality. The answer key requires both conditions: the belief must be irrational AND not commonly accepted to be considered delusional.

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

Your answer:

experiencing a loss of control, skepticism towards big institutions or governments, and anxiety

Feedback:

- Incorrect: Experiencing a loss of control is not listed among the specific cognitive and personality factors in the answer key.
- Incorrect: Skepticism towards big institutions or governments is not included in the answer key's list of cognitive and personality factors.
- Incorrect: Anxiety is not mentioned as one of the cognitive and personality factors in the answer key.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you donâ€™t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Source amnesia occurs when individuals remember the information they've acquired but forget where it came from. This can lead to believing incorrect answers are true simply because one has forgotten that the information was false, making it more difficult to learn the accurate facts.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies source amnesia as the mechanism and provides an accurate explanation of how it works - forgetting the source of information (that their answer was incorrect) can lead to mistaking the incorrect answer for the correct one, which interferes with learning.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

Mere-exposure effect refers to the phenomenon where we tend to favor things that are familiar to us; the more frequently we encounter the same statements, the more familiar they appear.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the mere-exposure effect and accurately explains that it involves favoring familiar things, specifically noting how frequent encounters with statements increase familiarity. This directly matches the answer key's explanation of mere exposure as the tendency to prefer things we are familiar with.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Individuals tend to downplay the likelihood of negative events occurring due to their positivity bias, which leads them to view situations more optimistically. In contrast, people with depression lack this bias and perceive things more realistically, without the hopeful outlook. This likely makes their predictions more accurate.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people with depression are more accurate at predicting negative events because they lack the optimistic bias that non-depressed individuals have. The answer demonstrates understanding that depression reduces overly optimistic tendencies, leading to more realistic and accurate predictions about negative outcomes.

Score: 1.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

As sensory information becomes less reliable, prior beliefs play a greater role in shaping perception, compensating for the uncertainty by relying more heavily on those prior beliefs.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when sensory information becomes less reliable/uncertain, prior beliefs have increased influence on perception, which directly matches the answer key's requirement.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You donâ€™t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other peopleâ€™s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

Pre-conventional stage: at this level, a person judges right and wrong based on the consequences of punishment or reward. Conventional stage: here, an individual considers the feelings and perspectives of others and follows societal rules. Post-conventional stage: reached by few, this stage involves focusing on moral principles and what is truly just and right.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the pre-conventional level as judging right and wrong based on consequences of punishment or reward, which matches the answer key's focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as considering others' feelings and perspectives and following societal rules, which aligns with the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly describes the post-conventional level as focusing on moral principles and what is truly just and right, which matches the answer key's focus on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model of past events suggests that when an outcome is definite, it becomes hard to picture what would have happened if a different choice had been made. This makes the outcome seem more probable, which leads to the sense that you predicted it all along, known as hindsight bias.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student doesn't clearly define what a causal model is. They describe its effects but don't explain that it's a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student correctly explains how causal models contribute to hindsight bias by making outcomes seem more probable/inevitable than they actually were, leading to the 'I knew it all along' effect.

Score: 0.5

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Hindsight bias occurs when individuals claim they predicted an event after it has happened. This is influenced by learning, as once the result is known, it cannot be forgotten and influences the bias.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that learning contributes to hindsight bias by explaining that once new information (the result) is learned, it cannot be forgotten and influences our judgment of past predictions. This captures the key concept that newly learned information cannot be avoided when estimating past likelihood judgments.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing involves choosing the best possible option, while satisficing means settling for an option that is good enough. Individuals with high levels of neuroticism are likely to adopt a maximizing approach to decision-making.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as choosing the best possible option, which aligns with the answer key's definition of trying to make the best choice.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as settling for an option that is good enough, which matches the answer key's definition of making a good-enough choice.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that individuals with high neuroticism are likely to adopt a maximizing approach, which matches the answer key's expectation.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

You can frequently expose your students to the coursework (mere-exposure effect) to help them become more comfortable with the content. By leveraging the primacy effect, ensuring that the initial impression of the course and materials is positive will lead students to view the course favorably overall. Utilize confirmation bias by presenting materials that align with students' existing beliefs, such as connecting first- and second-year topics to reinforce their understanding of psychological processes. Increase the appeal of the materials by making it easy for students to engage with them, requiring minimal effort.
