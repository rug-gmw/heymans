## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

We form moral judgments primarily through quick and automatic intuitive thinking, supplemented by a smaller amount of slow and deliberate rational thinking. The leading process in this model is System 1, which represents intuitive thought.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 represents intuitive thinking, which aligns with the answer key's requirement that System 1 refers to intuitions.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies System 2 as 'slow and deliberate rational thinking,' which matches the answer key's requirement that System 2 refers to reasoning or rational thought.
- Correct: The student clearly states that 'the leading process in this model is System 1' and describes it as the primary way we form moral judgments, correctly identifying System 1 as more dominant than System 2.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

Representativeness heuristic refers to the tendency to classify individuals into a specific group based on their appearance and how well they match the group's stereotype.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process in this scenario.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that representativeness heuristic involves classifying individuals based on how well they match stereotypes of a group, which captures the essence of estimating likelihood based on resemblance to category stereotypes.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring refers to forming an initial impression of something or someone based on the first piece of information received (the anchor), with subsequent details having less influence and only modifying the original anchor rather than replacing it. Similarly, the primacy effect involves remembering the first information most clearly. Both concepts share the characteristic of emphasizing the importance of the initial information.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as using the first piece of information as a starting point, though they provide more detail about how subsequent information modifies rather than replaces the anchor.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as remembering the first information most clearly, which aligns with the answer key's definition of better remembering the first piece of information.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both concepts share an emphasis on the importance of initial information, which matches the answer key's point about overreliance on the first piece of information.

Score: 1.0

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion means you give more importance to avoiding losses than to achieving gains, leading you to prefer options with guaranteed wins. In contrast, risk aversion involves selecting the safest choice to avoid taking any risks.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves giving more importance to avoiding losses than to achieving gains, which matches the answer key's definition of weighing losses more heavily than gains.
- Incorrect: The student defines risk aversion as 'selecting the safest choice to avoid taking any risks' which is too narrow and misses the key concept of preferring certainty over uncertainty in general decision-making contexts.

Score: 0.5

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias refers to the tendency to exaggerate the effects of an event on our future feelings. When ending a relationship, for example, people often predict that their life will be significantly worse after the breakup than it actually turns out to be.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as the tendency to exaggerate/overestimate the effects of future events on our future feelings, which matches the answer key definition.
- Correct: The student explains how impact bias prevents breakups by describing that people predict their life will be significantly worse after a breakup than it actually is, which demonstrates understanding of how overestimating negative impact discourages breakups.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves making choices based on how we expect we will feel about the results. It is crucial to keep this in mind for end-of-life decisions, as failing to do so means we might overlook the impact the outcome will have on our emotions.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes affective forecasting as 'making choices based on how we expect we will feel' rather than specifically defining it as predictions about our own future emotional state. The definition is too broad and misses the key concept of predicting future emotions.
- Incorrect: The student mentions considering emotional impact but fails to address the specific issue that healthy people may predict they'll want to die when sick, but actually may not prefer to die when they become sick. The answer is too general and misses the core point about prediction errors.

Score: 0.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

People tend to exaggerate small probabilities, perceiving 10% as closer to 20%, while they often overlook extremely low probabilities, treating 0.01% as basically zero.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people overestimate merely low probabilities, using the example of perceiving 10% as closer to 20%, which aligns with prospect theory's finding that low probabilities are often overweighted.
- Correct: The student accurately captures that extremely low probabilities are treated as impossibilities, stating that 0.01% is perceived as 'basically zero,' which matches the answer key's point about extremely low probabilities being interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency for individuals to place greater importance on avoiding losses than on acquiring gains. In terms of utility, this means people prefer options that offer higher (positive) utility over those that result in lower (negative) utility.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes loss aversion as preferring higher positive utility over lower negative utility, which is simply rational choice behavior. They miss the key point that loss aversion specifically means the utility function is asymmetric - that losses are weighted more heavily than equivalent gains (i.e., the value function is steeper in the loss domain than the gain domain).

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory focuses solely on financial results, while expected utility theory also accounts for nonfinancial factors and the tendency to avoid losses.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory focuses on financial results while expected utility theory accounts for nonfinancial factors, which matches the first point in the answer key.
- Correct: The student mentions 'tendency to avoid losses' which reflects risk aversion, correctly identifying that expected utility theory considers behavioral aspects that expected value theory does not, satisfying the second point.

Score: 1.0

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected value theory focuses on financial results. Expected utility theory expands on this by including non-financial outcomes and the tendency to avoid losses. Multi-attribute utility theory examines multiple attributes and assesses their relative importance. Prospect theory builds on expected utility theory by incorporating heuristics and cognitive biases.

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies expected value theory as focusing on financial results, which aligns with the answer key's description of financial outcomes with probabilities.
- Correct: Student accurately describes expected utility theory as expanding beyond financial outcomes to include non-financial/subjective outcomes, matching the answer key's explanation.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies multi-attribute utility theory as examining multiple attributes and their relative importance, which corresponds to the answer key's mention of multiple attributes with utilities and weights.
- Correct: Student accurately describes prospect theory as building on expected utility theory while incorporating heuristics and cognitive biases, which matches the answer key's description of it being descriptive and considering heuristics and biases.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Because individuals tend to feel the impact of losses more strongly than gains, they are likely to opt for the saving choice, avoiding the risk of losing anything when they have the chance to secure a guaranteed, albeit smaller, gain.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student answer describes loss aversion making people more risk averse by choosing safer options to avoid losses, which is the opposite of the answer key's point that loss aversion can make people risk-seeking when trying to avoid potential losses.

Score: 0.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning occurs when two things are linked together. In classical conditioning, two stimuli are connected because they occur simultaneously in the same place (for example, I link a particular scent to you because they often happen together). In operant conditioning, one event happens as a result of another, creating a connection between them (such as my cat purring when I pet it).

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as linking/connecting things together, which aligns with learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as connecting stimuli that occur simultaneously in the same place, with a good example of scent association, matching the answer key's description of associating things that happen together in time and space.
- Incorrect: The student's description of operant conditioning focuses on one event following another rather than the key concept that actions cause rewards or punishments. The cat purring example doesn't clearly demonstrate learning that actions lead to consequences.

Score: 0.6666666666666666

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation occurs when you believe that one event causes another, even though it does not. Illusory correlation happens when you assume that two things are related when, in reality, they are not.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that illusory causation involves incorrectly believing one event causes another (causal relationship), and illusory correlation involves incorrectly assuming two things are related when they are not (correlation). This captures the essential distinction between misinterpreting correlation as causation versus perceiving correlation where none exists.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

The Dutch healthcare system is considered a schema because it represents a general understanding of how the system functions. In contrast, a birthday party is viewed as a script because it outlines specific behaviors to follow, ensuring proper conduct.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the Dutch healthcare system as a schema and provides an appropriate explanation that it represents general understanding of how the system functions, which aligns with the concept of schemas as knowledge structures about relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies birthday party behavior as a script and explains it involves specific behaviors to follow for proper conduct, which matches the answer key's description of scripts as social schemas for behavior in specific situations.

Score: 1.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

Physical stance, as it ignores the mind since it cannot be quantified, focusing solely on the observable action of the hand moving when writing rather than the brain sending signals to the muscles to cause that movement.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the physical stance and provides good reasoning that behaviorists focused on observable behaviors rather than mental processes because the mind cannot be measured/quantified. The example of hand movement versus brain signals effectively illustrates the distinction between observable physical actions and unobservable mental processes.

Score: 1.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

The intuitional stance focuses on psychological processes, including the mind and emotions, rather than just the physical appearance.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the 'intuitional stance' (which is not one of Dennett's stances) and provides an irrelevant explanation about psychological processes vs. physical appearance. The correct answer is that evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

- Distinct: B occurs as a result of A - B consistently happens after A - without A, B does not occur - therefore, A causes B.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions 'Distinct' but doesn't explain distinctness/specificity correctly. They don't capture that B should follow A but not other events.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies consistency - that B consistently happens after A, which matches the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student doesn't mention plausibility as a separate heuristic about common sense making the causal relationship believable.
- Incorrect: The student doesn't mention contiguity in time and space as a heuristic for judging causation.
- Incorrect: The student doesn't mention similarity in cause and effect as a heuristic for judging causation.

Score: 0.2

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Negativity bias leads us to focus more on negative information. Since negative details are easier to recall, they shape our outcome bias, causing us to interpret situations more negatively than they actually are.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias and explains it as the tendency to focus more on negative information, which aligns with the answer key's definition.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention the availability heuristic at all, instead incorrectly refers to 'outcome bias' which is a different concept entirely.
- Incorrect: The student fails to explain how these biases specifically lead to overestimating moral outrage on social media, and does not connect the two biases in the required causal relationship.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

You link it to the person you dislike, so naturally you want to avoid using it, but since it is merely an object, logically it shouldn't make a difference.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes the phenomenon but fails to explain it in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge. The answer does not mention that biological contagion concepts are being incorrectly applied to the social/psychological domain, which is the key theoretical explanation requested.

Score: 0.0

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A delusional conspiracy theory is one that lacks widespread support, meaning very few people believe it (for example, the idea that China deliberately released the coronavirus to dominate the world). In contrast, a non-delusional conspiracy theory is one that has significant backing from many individuals (such as the belief that Putin intentionally caused the Wagner plane crash).

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student only identifies the 'commonly accepted' criterion but completely omits the 'irrational belief' component from the answer key. The definition requires both conditions - being an irrational belief AND not commonly accepted - to distinguish delusional from non-delusional conspiracy theories.

Score: 0.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

- Lacking intelligence - Being swayed by others - Becoming trapped in a repetitive thought pattern that makes the theory more readily recalled

Feedback:

- Correct: The student mentions 'lacking intelligence' which directly corresponds to 'having a low level of intelligence' from the answer key.
- Incorrect: Being 'swayed by others' is not mentioned in the answer key as one of the cognitive/personality factors contributing to conspiratorial thinking.
- Incorrect: While 'becoming trapped in a repetitive thought pattern' relates to cognitive processes, it doesn't match any of the specific factors listed in the answer key such as seeing patterns in randomness or low analytical thinking.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Due to the availability heuristic, if incorrect answers are more easily recalled than the correct ones, it hinders the learning process.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the availability heuristic as the mechanism. The availability heuristic relates to judging probability based on ease of recall, but the correct mechanisms are source amnesia (forgetting the source of information), proactive interference (old incorrect information interfering with new correct information), or the continued-influence effect. The student's answer doesn't address how incorrect answers can be mistaken for correct ones due to forgetting their original source.

Score: 0.0

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

This occurs because you are psychologically inclined to accept ideas that are repeatedly presented to you, especially when you no longer encounter information that challenges those ideas.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes a general psychological tendency related to repeated exposure but does not identify the specific mechanism. The answer key requires naming 'mere exposure' or the 'illusory-truth effect' as the specific psychological mechanisms, which the student fails to do.

Score: 0.0

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

No, major depressive disorder actually leads to more accurate perceptions. Individuals without depression often exaggerate negative predictions, believing that potential bad outcomes are worse than they truly are. In contrast, those with major depressive disorder are more likely to overestimate negative predictions.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly states that major depressive disorder leads to more accurate perceptions, but incorrectly explains the mechanism. The answer key indicates that people with depression are more accurate because they show reduced optimism bias, whereas the student incorrectly states that non-depressed people exaggerate negative predictions and that depressed people overestimate negative predictions, which contradicts the established finding about depressive realism.

Score: 0.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

The impact of existing beliefs on perception will become stronger.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that prior beliefs have a stronger influence on perception when sensory information reliability decreases, which directly matches the key concept from the answer key.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

1. Gather information 2. Seek opinions 3. Modify your opinion based on other viewpoints

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's first point 'Gather information' does not describe Kohlberg's pre-conventional level, which focuses on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Incorrect: The student's second point 'Seek opinions' does not accurately describe Kohlberg's conventional level, which focuses on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Incorrect: The student's third point 'Modify your opinion based on other viewpoints' does not describe Kohlberg's post-conventional level, which focuses on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

The causal model is a framework that views your past decision as the cause of the event that occurred. It leads to hindsight bias because you overlook other possible outcomes that were just as likely, assuming your decision could have resulted in a different event rather than the one that actually took place.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes a causal model as viewing past decisions as causes of events, but misses the key concept that it's a coherent narrative of how past events are related to each other.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly explains the mechanism - they suggest hindsight bias occurs because we overlook other outcomes, but the answer key states it's because events in the causal model seem more inevitable than they actually were.

Score: 0.0

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Learning influences hindsight bias because you use past experiences to guide future choices when faced with similar situations. However, since you believe you anticipated the outcome all along, you may not fully recognize that you made a wrong decision and therefore might not adjust your actions appropriately for future events.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes how hindsight bias affects future decision-making rather than explaining the core mechanism of how learning contributes to hindsight bias. The answer key requires understanding that newly learned information contaminates our ability to accurately recall past likelihood judgments, but the student focuses on behavioral consequences rather than the cognitive process of how new knowledge interferes with memory of previous beliefs.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing decision style involves choosing the optimal option, while satisficing decision style means selecting an option that is adequate. The person is more likely to use the maximizing decision style.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as choosing the optimal option, which aligns with 'trying to make the best choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly describes satisficing as selecting an adequate option, which matches 'making a good-enough choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that someone high in neuroticism is more likely to use the maximizing decision style, matching the answer key.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

For example, weekly assignments help information come to mind more readily due to the availability heuristic. This approach encourages people to engage more, as they are motivated to read the chapters and attend lectures in order to succeed in the weekly tasks and qualify for the exam.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement by proposing a specific solution (weekly assignments) and connecting it to psychological principles (availability heuristic). They explain how this approach would encourage active engagement through motivation to read and attend lectures, showing thoughtful consideration of the practical challenge posed in the question.
