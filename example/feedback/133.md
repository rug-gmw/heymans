## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

System 1 plays a more prominent role in this case, as it forms your initial moral judgment through intuition rather than deliberate thought. System 2 thinking occurs afterward, allowing you to potentially assess and reflect on the moral judgment you initially made.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 involves intuition rather than deliberate thought, which aligns with the answer key's description of System 1 as intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student implicitly references System 2 as involving assessment and reflection, which corresponds to the answer key's description of System 2 as reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student clearly states that System 1 plays a 'more prominent role' and forms the 'initial moral judgment,' indicating System 1's dominance over System 2, which matches the answer key.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

The representativeness heuristic involves judging that something or someone is part of a specific category based on how closely they resemble or match the typical characteristics of that category.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process in this scenario.
- Correct: The student provides an accurate explanation of the representativeness heuristic, describing how we judge category membership based on resemblance to typical characteristics, which aligns with the answer key's explanation about estimating likelihood based on resemblance to stereotypes.

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring involves relying on initial information as a reference point. The primacy effect describes how the first piece of information we receive creates a stronger and more lasting impression than later details. Both concepts focus on the influence of the initial information and how we tend to cling to it compared to subsequent information.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as relying on initial information as a reference point, which aligns with the answer key's description of taking the first piece of information as the starting point.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as the first information creating a stronger and more lasting impression, which corresponds to the answer key's point about better remembering the first piece of information.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both concepts involve focusing on and clinging to initial information compared to subsequent information, which matches the answer key's point about overreliance on the first piece of information.

Score: 1.0

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Risk aversion refers to our tendency to avoid taking risks, while loss aversion is our tendency to avoid losses by placing greater importance on potential losses than on potential gains.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves placing greater importance on potential losses than on potential gains, which captures the essence of weighing losses more heavily than gains.
- Incorrect: The student defines risk aversion as 'tendency to avoid taking risks' which is too vague and doesn't capture the key concept of preferring certainty over uncertainty when faced with equivalent expected outcomes.

Score: 0.5

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias occurs when we exaggerate the strength and length of our emotional response to a future event. This can cause individuals to avoid ending relationships because they believe they will feel more heartbroken or sad for a longer period than they actually would.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as exaggerating the strength and length of emotional responses to future events, which captures the essence of overestimating the impact of future events on our feelings.
- Correct: The student accurately explains how impact bias prevents breakups by stating people believe they will feel more heartbroken for longer than they actually would, which aligns with overestimating how bad a breakup will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting refers to predicting how future events will impact our emotions. This is significant because when making end-of-life decisions, we might believe we want things a certain way in the present, but our feelings could shift over time, resulting in different preferences. We often overestimate both the strength and length of our emotional reactions to these decisions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines affective forecasting as predicting how future events will impact our emotions, which captures the essence of predictions about future emotional states.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of the key concept that preferences can change over time, specifically mentioning that beliefs about wanting things 'a certain way in the present' can shift, which aligns with the answer key's point about healthy people's predictions versus actual preferences when sick.

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

According to prospect theory, individuals tend to undervalue small probabilities, often treating very unlikely events as if they cannot happen.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student states that individuals 'undervalue small probabilities' which contradicts the answer key that merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that very unlikely events are treated 'as if they cannot happen,' which aligns with extremely low probabilities being interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 0.5

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency to prioritize avoiding losses over acquiring gains. The idea or potential of losing feels uncomfortable, giving it a negative value.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes loss aversion as a general behavioral tendency but does not explain how this is reflected in utility terms in prospect theory. The answer lacks the key insight that negative utilities are weighted more heavily than positive utilities or that the value function is steeper for losses than gains.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected utility theory incorporates both non-monetary outcomes and an individual's risk aversion, whereas expected value theory focuses solely on financial results.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory focuses on financial results while expected utility theory incorporates non-monetary outcomes, which aligns with the answer key's distinction between financial and non-financial values.
- Correct: The student accurately states that expected utility theory incorporates risk aversion while expected value theory does not, which matches the answer key's point about considering heuristics and biases versus not considering them.

Score: 1.0

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected value theory focuses on financial results and involves selecting the option that maximizes value. Expected utility theory is similar but incorporates both non-financial outcomes and risk aversion, assigning a utility and probability to each choice. Multi-attribute utility theory considers each option by assigning both a utility and a weight. Prospect theory resembles expected utility theory but also accounts for heuristics and biases.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as focusing on financial outcomes and maximizing value, which aligns with the normative model described in the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes expected utility theory as similar to expected value theory but incorporating non-financial outcomes and subjective elements like risk aversion, matching the answer key's description of utilities that can be subjective rather than purely financial.
- Incorrect: The student mentions utility and weight assignment but fails to clearly explain that multi-attribute utility theory deals with options having multiple attributes, which is a key distinguishing feature mentioned in the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies prospect theory as similar to expected utility theory but incorporating heuristics and biases, and recognizes it as a descriptive/behavioral model as indicated in the answer key.

Score: 0.75

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

People may avoid taking risks because they are loss averse. Since some risks involve the chance of losing something, our tendency to prioritize avoiding losses over achieving gains causes us to steer clear of risks we believe will lead to loss—often exaggerating the potential negative outcome because of this loss aversion.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student answer describes loss aversion making people more risk averse by avoiding risks that could lead to losses. However, the answer key requires understanding that loss aversion can actually decrease risk aversion and make people risk-seeking when they are already facing potential losses (i.e., people become willing to take risks to avoid certain losses).

Score: 0.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning is the process of learning by making connections. Classical conditioning occurs when we associate two events because they occur near each other in time and place. Operant conditioning involves learning connections based on the relationship between behaviors and their consequences, such as rewards or punishments.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as a learning process involving making connections/associations, which aligns with the answer key's definition of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as associating two events that occur near each other in time and place, which matches the answer key's explanation of learning to associate things that happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning connections between behaviors and their consequences (rewards or punishments), which directly corresponds to the answer key's definition of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation occurs when we wrongly believe that one thing causes another, while illusory correlation happens when we incorrectly assume there is a correlation between two things.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly distinguishes between illusory causation (wrongly believing one thing causes another) and illusory correlation (incorrectly assuming correlation exists between two things), which matches the key distinction that illusory causation involves misinterpreting correlation as causation while illusory correlation involves perceiving non-existent correlations.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

Knowing how the Dutch healthcare system operates is an example of a schema, as it represents general knowledge anticipated in a certain context. In contrast, the appropriate behavior at a birthday party is a script, since it is a socially and culturally specific schema—in this case, Dutch—applied to a familiar or routine occasion.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the Dutch healthcare system as a schema and provides an appropriate explanation that it represents general knowledge in a context, which aligns with the answer key's description of schemas as knowledge and relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies birthday party behavior as a script and provides a good explanation that it is a culturally specific schema applied to a routine situation, which matches the answer key's description of scripts as social schemas for specific situations.

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

Design stance level of analysis: it was created with the idea that psychologists should concentrate on how stimuli elicit behavior, based on the understanding that the mind itself cannot be directly measured.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the design stance instead of the physical stance. Behaviorists focused on the causal mechanisms and processes by which stimuli produce behaviors, which is characteristic of the physical stance, not the design stance which would focus on the purpose or function of behaviors.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

The design stance explains why something exists based on its function or purpose, illustrating why it is created in a particular way. For instance, it might clarify why favoring one's own group is advantageous. This approach does not consider physical characteristics or the intentions and thoughts involved, so the mechanical or intentional stances would not be appropriate for this type of analysis.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance and provides accurate reasoning - they explain that the design stance focuses on function/purpose and gives a relevant example of ingroup favoritism. They also demonstrate understanding by explaining why other stances (mechanical and intentional) would not be appropriate for this analysis.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Contiguity in time and space occurs when B takes place immediately after A and both events are located close to each other. Distinctiveness means B happens exclusively after A and not after any other event. Plausibility refers to the logical sense of B occurring as a result of A. Similarity of cause and effect involves A and B sharing comparable features. Consistency means that over time, in a similar setting, B consistently follows A.

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies distinctiveness and explains it as B happening exclusively after A and not after other events, which matches the answer key's concept of specificity.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies consistency and explains it as B consistently following A over time in similar settings, which aligns with the answer key.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies plausibility and explains it as the logical sense of B occurring as a result of A, which matches the answer key's common sense criterion.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies contiguity in time and space, explaining it as B occurring immediately after A with both events located close together, which matches the answer key.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies similarity of cause and effect, explaining it as A and B sharing comparable features, which aligns with the answer key's concept of superficial resemblance.

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Negativity bias causes us to focus on negative emotional content, such as morally outraged posts on social media. Confirmation bias leads us to seek out information that supports our belief that many people are morally outraged online. As a result, we repeatedly encounter similar posts and mistakenly believe that a large number of people share this outrage. Social media algorithms further amplify this mistaken perception.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias and explains that it causes us to focus on negative emotional content like morally outraged posts, which aligns with the answer key's definition.
- Incorrect: The student mentions confirmation bias instead of the availability heuristic. While confirmation bias is related, the answer key specifically requires the availability heuristic - the tendency to estimate frequency based on ease of recall.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of how the two biases work together to create overestimation, explaining that repeated encounters with similar content lead to mistaken beliefs about prevalence, which captures the essential mechanism described in the answer key.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

Adopting the intentional stance, you avoid using items owned by someone you strongly dislike because you believe that touching them might pass on unpleasant or undesirable qualities, even though this idea lacks logical justification. This behavior and your reasoning are explained by the concept of magical contagion.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes magical contagion but does not explain it in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge. The answer does not identify that biological contagion concepts are being incorrectly applied to the social/psychological domain, which is the key insight requested.

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A delusional conspiracy theory is one that is not accepted within a particular context, whereas a non-delusional conspiracy theory is accepted in that same context. Whether a conspiracy theory is considered delusional or not depends on the specific context.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly identifies that acceptance/non-acceptance distinguishes delusional from non-delusional conspiracy theories, but fails to mention the crucial criterion of irrationality. The answer key requires both irrationality AND lack of common acceptance for a theory to be considered delusional.

Your answer:

Individuals who engage in conspiratorial thinking often feel isolated, perceive themselves as oppressed, or belong to marginalized groups such as those with low income.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions feeling isolated, but this is not listed among the cognitive and personality factors in the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student mentions perceiving themselves as oppressed, but this is not among the specified cognitive and personality factors in the answer key.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

ongoing impact phenomenon

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The answer 'ongoing impact phenomenon' is too vague and does not specifically identify any of the psychological mechanisms mentioned in the answer key (source amnesia, proactive interference, or continued-influence effect). While it might loosely relate to the general concept, it lacks the precision and psychological terminology required.

Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

the tendency to develop a preference for things simply because they are familiar

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the mere exposure effect, describing it as the tendency to develop a preference for things simply because they are familiar, which matches the answer key's definition of mere exposure as the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

affirmative

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student simply answered 'affirmative' which does not demonstrate understanding of the key concept that people with major depressive disorder are more accurate at making predictions about negative events due to reduced optimism bias. The answer lacks any explanation of the relationship between depression and predictive accuracy.

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

Our perception is more influenced by prior beliefs when the sensory information or evidence is weak, causing it to align more closely with those prior beliefs.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when sensory information is weak/unreliable, prior beliefs have greater influence on perception, which directly matches the key concept in the answer key.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

The pre-conventional level involves making moral decisions centered on personal gain and the desire to avoid punishment. At the conventional level, moral judgments align with societal norms and rules. The post-conventional level reflects moral reasoning grounded in a more profound grasp of ethical principles.

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly describes pre-conventional level as focusing on personal gain and avoiding punishment, which matches the answer key's description of obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: Student accurately describes conventional level as aligning with societal norms and rules, which corresponds to the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies post-conventional level as grounded in ethical principles, which aligns with the answer key's description of focus on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

After learning the outcome, we often create a causal explanation or narrative of how it occurred. This process contributes to hindsight bias by leading us to construct a story that explains the actual result.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a causal model involves creating a causal explanation or narrative of how events occurred, which aligns with the answer key's definition of a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Incorrect: While the student mentions that constructing a story contributes to hindsight bias, they don't explain the key mechanism - that events within this causal model seem more inevitable than they actually were, which is the core of how causal models contribute to hindsight bias.

Score: 0.5

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

It is impossible to avoid acquiring new information (curse of knowledge), particularly the real result of an event. This makes it simpler to remember the actual outcome rather than the potential alternatives, which reinforces our hindsight bias and leads us to believe we predicted it from the start.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that newly learned information cannot be avoided when estimating past likelihood judgments, mentions the curse of knowledge by name, and explains how this contributes to hindsight bias by making actual outcomes seem more predictable in retrospect.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing involves aiming for the optimal result, while satisficing means choosing an outcome that is adequate. A person with a high level of neuroticism is more likely to use a maximizing approach to decision-making.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies maximizing as aiming for the optimal result, which aligns with the answer key's description of trying to make the best choice.
- Correct: The student correctly describes satisficing as choosing an outcome that is adequate, which matches the answer key's description of making a good-enough choice.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a person with high neuroticism is more likely to use a maximizing approach, which matches the answer key.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

The strategy involves finding ways to keep students actively involved while considering the constraints of limited time and resources. I would review various options, such as group assignments, group presentations, or still administering an exam but adopting a more efficient method for providing feedback and grading. Next, I would evaluate how suitable each assessment format is, considering factors like student engagement and feasibility within time and resource limits. Based on this assessment, I would choose the option that appears most appropriate as the examination method.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement with the question by acknowledging the key constraint (limited time and resources), proposing multiple concrete solutions (group assignments, presentations, efficient exam feedback methods), and outlining a systematic evaluation process to select the most appropriate assessment method. The answer shows thoughtful consideration of the balance between student engagement and practical feasibility.
