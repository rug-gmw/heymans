## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

- The function of System 1 thinking in moral reasoning accounts for the rapid nature of moral judgments, as we rely on intuition or gut feelings to determine what is morally right. - The function of System 2 thinking in moral reasoning involves consciously reflecting on a moral choice after an initial intuitive decision has been made. - In this model, System 1 is considered the most influential.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies System 1 thinking as involving intuition/gut feelings in moral reasoning, which aligns with the answer key's requirement that System 1 refers to intuitions or emotion.
- Correct: The student accurately describes System 2 thinking as involving conscious reflection on moral choices, which corresponds to the answer key's requirement that System 2 refers to reasoning or rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student correctly states that System 1 is 'most influential,' which satisfies the answer key's requirement that System 1 thinking is more dominant than System 2 thinking.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

- The assumption is based on the representativeness heuristic. - This heuristic occurs when an object or event is seen as typical of a particular category or matches its prototype. - In this case, the colleague resembles the typical image of a fashion model.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive mechanism for this assumption.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of the representativeness heuristic by explaining that it involves judging likelihood based on resemblance to a prototype/stereotype, and correctly applies this to the fashion model example.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

- Anchoring refers to the process of using the initial value selected as the reference point. - The primacy effect is a cognitive bias where greater emphasis is placed on the first piece of information or trait encountered. - Both anchoring and the primacy effect demonstrate the significant impact that the initial value has in a given context.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as using the initial value as a reference point, which matches the answer key's description of taking the first piece of information as the starting point.
- Incorrect: The student describes the primacy effect as placing greater emphasis on first information, but the answer key specifically requires mentioning that it's about better remembering the first piece of information, not just emphasizing it.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both phenomena demonstrate the significant impact of initial values/information, which aligns with the answer key's point about overreliance on the first piece of information.

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion centers on the absence of potential gains, while risk aversion concentrates on the impact that a loss has on a person.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly describes loss aversion as being about 'absence of potential gains' rather than the correct concept that losses are weighted more heavily than equivalent gains.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly describes risk aversion as concentrating on 'impact that a loss has on a person' rather than the correct concept of preferring certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 0.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias refers to the tendency to exaggerate the emotional intensity of a future event. This bias might lead individuals to avoid ending a relationship despite being unhappy, as they anticipate that the breakup will bring significant stress and anger, even though separating would be ultimately beneficial for them.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies impact bias as the tendency to exaggerate emotional intensity of future events, which aligns with overestimating the impact of future events on feelings.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that impact bias prevents breakups because people anticipate the breakup will cause significant negative emotions (stress and anger), demonstrating understanding of how overestimating negative impact leads to avoidance.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting refers to the present assessment of how a person believes they will feel in a future circumstance. It is crucial to take this into account in end-of-life decisions because individuals often have distorted predictions about their future emotions. One illustration of this distortion is the application of the peak-end rule.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines affective forecasting as predictions about future emotional states, using slightly different wording ('present assessment of how a person believes they will feel in a future circumstance') but capturing the same core concept.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of why affective forecasting matters in end-of-life decisions by explaining that people have 'distorted predictions about their future emotions,' which aligns with the answer key's point about healthy people's preferences potentially changing when they actually become sick.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

- People tend to undervalue events with low probabilities. - They often believe that while probabilities like 10% have a chance of happening, extremely low probabilities such as 0.01% are seen as impossible or never occurring. - However, the idea that very low probabilities cannot happen is mistaken, as there remains some possibility they may occur.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student states people 'undervalue events with low probabilities' but the answer key indicates that merely low probabilities (like 10%) are often overestimated, not undervalued.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that extremely low probabilities (0.01%) are seen as impossible or never occurring, which aligns with the answer key point about being interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 0.5

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

In prospect theory, loss aversion describes a tendency for people to avoid choices that could result in losses.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes loss aversion as a behavioral tendency to avoid losses, but does not explain how this is reflected in the utility function itself - specifically that negative utilities are weighted more heavily than positive utilities or that the value function is steeper for losses than gains.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

- Expected value theory centers on monetary outcomes, while expected utility theory emphasizes the personal significance of a decision. - Expected utility theory accounts for loss aversion, unlike expected value theory, which ignores such biases.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory focuses on monetary/financial outcomes while expected utility theory considers personal significance/non-financial values of decisions.
- Correct: The student correctly recognizes that expected utility theory accounts for psychological biases (specifically mentioning loss aversion) while expected value theory does not consider such heuristics and biases.

Score: 1.0

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

- Expected utility theory emphasizes the personal value or satisfaction derived from a choice. - Expected value theory concentrates on the financial or monetary outcome of a choice. - Multi-attribute utility theory (MAUT) considers various features of a choice, incorporating both the utility and importance assigned to each attribute. - Prospect theory resembles expected utility theory but additionally accounts for the influence of heuristics and biases in decision making.

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies expected value theory as focusing on financial/monetary outcomes, which aligns with the answer key's description of financial outcomes with probabilities.
- Correct: Student accurately describes expected utility theory as emphasizing personal value/satisfaction, which matches the answer key's explanation of subjective utility beyond just financial outcomes.
- Correct: Student correctly explains MAUT as considering various features/attributes with both utility and importance (weight), which directly corresponds to the answer key's description of multiple attributes with utilities and weights.
- Correct: Student accurately describes prospect theory as similar to expected utility theory but incorporating heuristics and biases, which matches the answer key's description of it being a descriptive behavioral model that considers these cognitive factors.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Loss aversion influences how risk-averse individuals are because people often perceive losses as risks. Both loss aversion and risk aversion result in negative utility, causing individuals to avoid taking risks.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that loss aversion reinforces risk aversion, when the answer key requires understanding that loss aversion can actually decrease risk aversion and make people risk-seeking when trying to avoid losses. The student misses the key insight that people become willing to take risks to avoid potential losses.

Score: 0.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning is the process of learning associations between events—classical conditioning involves understanding how two stimuli are linked, while operant conditioning involves learning how a specific behavior can result in rewards or consequences.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as learning associations between events, which aligns with the answer key's definition of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as understanding how two stimuli are linked, which matches the answer key's explanation of learning to associate things that happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning how behavior results in rewards or consequences, which aligns with the answer key's description of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation occurs when we mistakenly believe that event or object A causes or results in event or object B. Illusory correlation happens when we incorrectly assume that event or object A and event or object B are linked, such that changes in one correspond to changes in the other.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly distinguishes between illusory causation (mistakenly believing A causes B) and illusory correlation (incorrectly assuming A and B are linked/correlated). While the wording differs from the answer key, the core conceptual understanding is accurate - illusory causation involves incorrect causal interpretation while illusory correlation involves perceiving a relationship that doesn't exist.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

The Dutch healthcare system is viewed as a schema because it centers on understanding the structure of a process. In contrast, the expected behavior at a birthday party is regarded as a script since it involves a culturally recognized sequence of actions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the healthcare system as a schema and provides a valid explanation that it involves understanding structure and processes, which aligns with schemas being about knowledge and relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies birthday party behavior as a script and accurately explains it involves a sequence of actions in a specific cultural context, which matches the answer key's description of scripts as social schemas for specific situations.

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

Behaviorists took a physical perspective because they concentrated primarily on an individual's behavioral or physical characteristics.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly identifies the physical stance but provides an incomplete explanation. They mention focusing on 'behavioral or physical characteristics' but miss the key causal relationship that behaviorists emphasized - how stimuli trigger or cause behaviors. The answer key specifically requires understanding that behaviorists focused on the processes that caused stimuli to result in behavior, not just the behaviors themselves.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

- Evolutionary psychologists take an intentional or evolutionary perspective, emphasizing the inherent drive to adapt and evolve based on our environmental conditions.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the stance as 'intentional or evolutionary perspective' rather than the design stance. While they mention adaptation and evolution, they miss the key point that evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance because they analyze psychological processes in terms of their function or purpose, not because of intentional drives.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

- Uniqueness: event A occurs exclusively when event B happens. - Similarity: the degree to which event A resembles event B. - Proximity in location and timing: event A happens near event B both spatially and temporally. - Inhibition: event A and event B never occur simultaneously, possibly because something prevents them from happening together.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: Student mentions 'uniqueness' which is related to distinctness/specificity, but describes it incorrectly as A occurring when B happens, rather than B following A but not other events.
- Incorrect: Student does not mention consistency - the idea that B always follows A when A occurs.
- Incorrect: Student does not mention plausibility - the common sense assessment of whether A could reasonably cause B.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies proximity/contiguity in time and space as a heuristic for causation.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies similarity between cause and effect, though describes it as 'degree to which A resembles B' rather than superficial resemblance.

Score: 0.4

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Negativity bias plays a role because we are naturally attracted to emotionally negative material. The availability heuristic also influences this, as we tend to recall examples that come to mind quickly. These two factors combine, with our negativity bias causing us to concentrate on morally outraged content, and the availability heuristic making it easier to remember these negative events. As a result, we overestimate the number of people who are morally outraged based on what we encounter on social media.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias and explains it as our natural attraction to emotionally negative material, which aligns with the answer key's description of seeking out or placing more weight on negative information like morally outraged content.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the availability heuristic and explains it as our tendency to recall examples that come to mind quickly, which matches the answer key's definition of estimating frequency based on ease of recall.
- Correct: The student successfully explains how these biases work together - negativity bias causes focus on morally outraged content, and availability heuristic makes these negative events easier to remember, leading to overestimation of moral outrage frequency, which matches the answer key's explanation of their interaction.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

The example provided in the question illustrates how someone might apply their limited knowledge from various fields like physics, biology, and psychology beyond its appropriate scope.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions applying knowledge beyond appropriate scope but fails to specifically identify that biological contagion concepts are being incorrectly applied to the social/psychological domain, which is the core explanation required by the answer key.

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A delusional conspiracy theory is viewed as impossible and lacks cultural acceptance, while a non-delusional conspiracy theory is seen as possible and is culturally accepted.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the two key distinguishing factors: irrationality/impossibility (which aligns with 'irrational belief') and lack of cultural acceptance (which aligns with 'not commonly accepted'). The student accurately contrasts delusional theories as impossible and culturally unaccepted versus non-delusional theories as possible and culturally accepted.

Your answer:

The three elements are neuroticism, depression, and mental health conditions.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: Neuroticism is not listed among the cognitive and personality factors in the answer key that contribute to conspiratorial thinking.
- Incorrect: Depression is not mentioned in the answer key as one of the factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking.
- Incorrect: Mental health conditions are not specified in the answer key as factors contributing to conspiratorial thinking.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Incorrect answers can disrupt learning due to the psychological processes of blocking and source amnesia. Individuals may recall that the answer seemed important but fail to remember that it was actually incorrect.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies source amnesia as the key mechanism, explaining that people may remember the incorrect answer as important but forget that it was wrong. While 'blocking' is not from the answer key, the core concept of source amnesia causing confusion between correct and incorrect information is accurately described.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

The psychological principle they aim to utilize by repeatedly presenting their message to increase its appeal is known as the mere exposure effect.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the mere exposure effect as the psychological mechanism politicians use to make their messages more attractive through repetition. This directly matches the answer key, which states 'Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with.'

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Yes, major depressive disorder reduces individuals' accuracy in making such predictions.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that major depressive disorder reduces accuracy in predictions about negative events. According to the answer key, people with major depressive disorder are actually MORE accurate at making such predictions due to reduced optimism bias, not less accurate.

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

When sensory information becomes less reliable, prior beliefs have a greater impact on perception.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when sensory information becomes less reliable, prior beliefs have a greater impact on perception, which directly matches the key concept from the answer key.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

The three stages of moral development are: - the preconventional stage, where morality is understood primarily in terms of personal consequences and self-interest (somewhat hedonistic). - the conventional stage, where moral reasoning is based on social norms and the expectations of others. - the postconventional stage, where individuals develop a more advanced comprehension of morality and its complexities.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the preconventional level and accurately describes it as focusing on personal consequences and self-interest, which aligns with the answer key's description of avoiding punishment or gaining rewards.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the conventional level and accurately describes it as based on social norms and expectations of others, which matches the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Incorrect: While the student correctly identifies the postconventional level, the description is too vague ('more advanced comprehension of morality and its complexities') and fails to mention the key aspect of abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

The causal model of past events explains how we assign causes to an event after it has occurred. It plays a role in hindsight bias by reinforcing the belief that we "knew it all along," as our minds create a sense of causation.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a causal model explains how we assign causes to events after they occur, which aligns with the concept of creating a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student accurately describes how causal models contribute to hindsight bias by creating a sense of causation that reinforces the 'knew it all along' feeling, which relates to making events seem more inevitable than they actually were.

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Learning adds to hindsight bias by expanding the information we currently possess, making it difficult to distinguish between what we knew and didn't know at the time of the event, which results in a greater tendency toward hindsight bias.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that learning contributes to hindsight bias by making it difficult to separate current knowledge from past knowledge when making retrospective judgments. This aligns with the key concept that newly learned information cannot be avoided when estimating past likelihood judgments.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

- The maximizing decision style involves striving to select the optimal choice. - The satisficing decision style involves settling for an option that is adequate rather than the absolute best. - Individuals with high levels of neuroticism tend to prefer a maximizing decision style.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as striving to select the optimal choice, which aligns with the answer key's description of trying to make the best choice.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as settling for an adequate option rather than the absolute best, which matches the answer key's description of making a good-enough choice.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that individuals high in neuroticism tend to prefer a maximizing decision style, which directly matches the answer key.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

Drawing from what I've learned in this course, I recommend using a multiple-choice examination format. However, the questions should be very precise to minimize reliance on the representativeness heuristic. From my experience and that of my peers as students, in multiple-choice exams, we often select answers that broadly represent the concept or topic in the question. This approach helps reduce the time needed for grading and feedback while maintaining the test's reliability in demonstrating students' understanding of the course material.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement by connecting course concepts (representativeness heuristic) to practical teaching challenges, proposing a specific solution (precise multiple-choice questions), and supporting their reasoning with personal experience. They address the core constraint of limited time/resources while showing understanding of both cognitive biases and assessment design.
