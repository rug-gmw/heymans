## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

In his model, System 1 holds the greatest influence. The social-intuitionist model suggests that we respond to moral issues primarily through immediate emotional reactions. Even when logical reasoning challenges our initial judgment, it remains difficult to alter since the response is rooted in emotion rather than logic.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 involves emotional reactions, which aligns with the answer key's requirement that System 1 refers to intuitions/emotion.
- Incorrect: The student mentions 'logical reasoning' but does not explicitly connect this to System 2 thinking as required by the answer key.
- Correct: The student clearly states that 'System 1 holds the greatest influence' and explains that emotional responses dominate over logical reasoning, satisfying the requirement that System 1 is more dominant.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

The assumption is based on the representativeness heuristic, which suggests that when an improbable event appears more typical than a probable one, we tend to believe it is more likely, while ignoring the actual base rates.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process.
- Incorrect: The student's explanation focuses on improbable vs probable events and base rates, but misses the key concept that representativeness involves judging category membership based on similarity to stereotypes or prototypes of that category.

Score: 0.5

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring refers to the initial reference point we establish, which we use to evaluate all later information. The primacy effect means that the first information we encounter is the most strongly retained. Both influence how we perceive and process information and play a key role in forming impressions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as establishing an initial reference point that influences evaluation of subsequent information, which aligns with the answer key's definition of taking the first piece of information as a starting point.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as the first information being most strongly retained, which matches the answer key's definition of better remembering the first piece of information.
- Correct: The student identifies that both concepts influence information processing and impression formation, which demonstrates understanding of their shared characteristic of overreliance on first information, though expressed in slightly different terms.

Score: 1.0

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion specifically relates to financial matters, emphasizing that people perceive losses as more significant than gains of equal value. In contrast, risk aversion refers more broadly to the overall inclination to steer clear of risks.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly limits loss aversion to financial matters only, when it actually applies broadly to all types of losses and gains, not just financial ones.
- Incorrect: The student defines risk aversion as avoiding risks generally, but the answer key specifically refers to preferring certainty over uncertainty, which is more precise than just 'avoiding risks.'

Score: 0.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias is a tendency where people, after committing to something, are more inclined to continue their investment. This can make it difficult for individuals to end relationships because they want to avoid the feeling of loss associated with the effort they have already put in.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student confuses impact bias with sunk cost fallacy. Impact bias is about overestimating the emotional impact of future events, not about continuing investments due to past commitments.
- Incorrect: The student's explanation about difficulty ending relationships is based on sunk cost reasoning (avoiding loss of past investment) rather than overestimating how bad a breakup would feel emotionally.

Score: 0.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting refers to anticipating how future events will impact our emotions. It is crucial to keep this in mind for end-of-life choices because people tend to be inaccurate in predicting their feelings—someone who is healthy might believe they would prefer death over illness, but their perspective can change when they actually become ill.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines affective forecasting as predicting future emotional states, though they phrase it as 'anticipating how future events will impact our emotions' which captures the same concept.
- Correct: The student accurately explains the key point that healthy people may predict they would prefer death when sick, but their actual preferences may differ when they become ill, demonstrating understanding of the forecasting bias in end-of-life decisions.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

We often perceive very small probabilities as impossible, leading us to underestimate them. Whether we undervalue or overvalue these low probabilities depends on how the situation is presented (in terms of gains or losses).

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that low probabilities are underestimated, when the answer key indicates that merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that very small probabilities are perceived as impossible, which aligns with the answer key's point about extremely low probabilities being interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 0.5

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion means that the satisfaction from gaining something is less intense than the dissatisfaction experienced from losing that same thing.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly captures the core concept of loss aversion - that losses have greater psychological impact than equivalent gains. While they use 'satisfaction/dissatisfaction' rather than 'utility' terminology, they demonstrate understanding that negative outcomes are weighted more heavily than positive ones of equal magnitude.

Score: 1.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

- Expected value theory considers only the monetary outcomes, while expected utility theory incorporates the tendency to avoid losses.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory focuses on monetary outcomes while expected utility theory goes beyond just financial values, though they phrase it as 'tendency to avoid losses' rather than 'non-financial values'.
- Correct: The student correctly captures that expected utility theory incorporates behavioral aspects (tendency to avoid losses/risk aversion) while expected value theory does not consider such heuristics and biases.

Score: 1.0

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected utility theory resembles expected value theory but acknowledges that individuals consider not only value but also their emotions. Expected value theory posits that people choose financial options that maximize value. Prospect theory builds on expected utility theory by incorporating people's biases and mental shortcuts. Multi-attribute choice theory is a framework for optimal decision-making that evaluates each characteristic of a choice and calculates its worth.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as dealing with financial options and maximizing value, which aligns with the key point about financial outcomes and probabilities.
- Correct: The student accurately describes expected utility theory as building on expected value theory but incorporating subjective elements (emotions) beyond financial value, matching the answer key's emphasis on non-financial, subjective utility.
- Correct: The student correctly describes multi-attribute choice theory as evaluating multiple characteristics and calculating their worth, which corresponds to the answer key's description of multiple attributes with utilities and weights.
- Correct: The student accurately identifies prospect theory as building on expected utility theory while incorporating biases and mental shortcuts (heuristics), matching the answer key's description of it as a descriptive model that considers heuristics and biases.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Individuals tend to avoid risk when presented with gain-framed messages but are more willing to take risks when faced with loss-framed messages. As a result, the prospect of a loss makes people more inclined to engage in risky behavior.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion leads people to become more willing to take risks when facing potential losses, which directly addresses how loss aversion decreases risk aversion and can make people risk-seeking.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning is the process of learning by association. Classical conditioning involves learning based on the close timing and placement of two events. Operant conditioning involves learning by using rewards and punishments. In classical conditioning, a specific stimulus is linked to a particular response, while operant conditioning encourages behaviors through rewards and discourages them through punishment.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as learning by association, which aligns with the answer key's definition of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as learning based on close timing and placement of two events, which matches the answer key's explanation of learning to associate things that happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning through rewards and punishments, which directly corresponds to the answer key's definition of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation involves mistakenly believing that one event causes another, whereas illusory correlation involves mistakenly believing that two events are connected. Illusory correlation does not imply a causal relationship.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly distinguishes that illusory causation involves mistakenly inferring a causal relationship between events, while illusory correlation involves mistakenly perceiving a connection/correlation between variables that aren't actually correlated. The additional clarification that illusory correlation doesn't imply causation shows good understanding of the distinction.

Score: 1.0

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

Comprehending how healthcare operates is an example of a schema, while being aware of the appropriate behavior at a party is a script, since it typically involves a sequence of specific events occurring in order.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that understanding how healthcare operates is a schema, which aligns with the answer key's explanation that schemas correspond to knowledge and relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that knowing appropriate behavior at a party is a script. While their explanation focuses on sequential events rather than social behavioral expectations, they demonstrate understanding that scripts involve specific situational behaviors.

Score: 1.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

Physical stance – since they only examined the physiological process without inferring anything about the mental processes behind it.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the physical stance and provides accurate reasoning. They understand that behaviorists focused on observable physiological processes and stimulus-response relationships without making inferences about mental states or processes, which aligns with the physical stance's emphasis on mechanistic causation.

Score: 1.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

They take the intentional stance by concentrating on the motivations behind the communities' actions and making sense of them.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the intentional stance instead of the design stance. While they mention motivations and making sense of actions, evolutionary psychology focuses on the functional design and adaptive purpose of psychological processes, not on beliefs and desires that characterize the intentional stance.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

1. Plausibility – based on what we know, A could potentially lead to B. 2. Temporal and spatial closeness – A and B take place near each other in time and location. 3. Consistency – A and B nearly always occur together. 4. Cause and effect – A consistently precedes B. 5. Similarity – A and B happen under comparable conditions.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student does not mention distinctness/specificity, which requires that B follows A but not other events.
- Incorrect: The student describes consistency as 'A and B nearly always occur together' rather than 'B always follows A', missing the directional causation aspect.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies plausibility as being based on whether A could potentially lead to B given our knowledge.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies temporal and spatial closeness, describing that A and B take place near each other in time and location.
- Incorrect: The student describes similarity as 'happening under comparable conditions' rather than A and B superficially resembling each other.

Score: 0.4

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

This is influenced by the availability heuristic and negativity bias. The availability heuristic causes negative information to appear more frequent than it actually is. Meanwhile, negativity bias leads us to focus more on negative information. As a result, because we encounter it often and assume its frequency based on exposure, we greatly overestimate how common it truly is.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias and explains it as the tendency to focus more on negative information, which aligns with the answer key's definition of seeking out or placing more weight on negative information.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the availability heuristic and demonstrates understanding that it involves estimating frequency based on how often we encounter examples, which matches the answer key's definition of estimating probability based on ease of recall.
- Correct: The student successfully explains the interaction between the two biases - that negativity bias causes us to encounter negative content more often, which then leads the availability heuristic to make us overestimate its frequency, matching the answer key's explanation of the mechanism.

Score: 1.0

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

This occurs because individuals often apply framework theories from fields like biology or physics too broadly, causing them to believe that this kind of contagion can happen. For instance, while we understand that a sick person can spread germs by touching objects (biology), this concept does not hold true for psychological traits, yet people still mistakenly extend the theory into what is known as magical contagion.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that biological contagion concepts are being inappropriately applied to non-biological domains (psychological/social), which matches the answer key's requirement to explain how contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to other domains.

Score: 1.0

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A delusional conspiracy theory, unlike a non-delusional one, is not recognized or accepted by society.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student only mentions social acceptance as the distinguishing factor but omits the crucial element of irrationality. The answer key requires both conditions: the belief must be irrational AND not commonly accepted to be considered delusional.

Score: 0.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

-noticing patterns that aren’t actually there -attributing complex events to overly simple causes -having a lack of trust in government

Feedback:

- Correct: This correctly identifies 'seeing patterns in randomness' from the answer key, which matches the concept of noticing patterns that aren't actually there.
- Correct: This accurately describes 'believing in simple explanations for complex events' from the answer key, capturing the essence of attributing complex events to overly simple causes.
- Incorrect: While lack of trust in government may relate to conspiratorial thinking, it is not listed among the specific cognitive and personality factors in the answer key.

Score: 2.0

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Corrective learning refers to the difficulty we face in discarding previously acquired knowledge, even when we are aware that it is incorrect.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes a general concept about difficulty discarding incorrect knowledge but doesn't identify the specific psychological mechanism. The answer key requires naming source amnesia (forgetting the answer was incorrect), proactive interference (initial incorrect answer interfering with correct one), or continued-influence effect. The student's description of 'corrective learning' is too vague and doesn't match any of the required mechanisms.

Score: 0.0

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

They aim to increase its appeal by leveraging the mere exposure effect, which suggests that repeated exposure to something generally leads to greater liking.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the mere exposure effect as the psychological mechanism and accurately describes how repeated exposure leads to increased liking/preference, which directly matches the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Yes, because individuals with depression tend to focus more on negative aspects.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that depression makes people less accurate at predictions, when the correct answer is that depression makes people more accurate due to reduced optimism bias. The student also provides an incorrect explanation focusing on negative attention rather than realistic assessment.

Score: 0.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

Prior beliefs have a greater impact because the brain relies more on them to compensate for missing sensory information.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that prior beliefs have greater impact when sensory reliability decreases, and provides a reasonable explanation that the brain compensates for unreliable sensory information by relying more heavily on prior expectations.

Score: 1.0

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

1. Pre-conventional stage - moral decisions are based on avoiding punishment or seeking rewards. 2. Conventional stage - moral decisions are influenced by personal benefits and an awareness of societal norms; many individuals remain at this level. 3. Post-conventional stage - moral reasoning becomes more advanced, involving strong feelings about moral wrongs in certain laws and rules.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the pre-conventional level and accurately describes it as being based on avoiding punishment or seeking rewards, which matches the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the conventional level and mentions awareness of societal norms, which aligns with the answer key's focus on social norms, though they also mention personal benefits which is less precise.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the post-conventional level and describes it as involving advanced moral reasoning with strong feelings about moral wrongs in laws and rules, which captures the essence of abstract principles and values from the answer key.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model outlines the logical story we construct to explain why events occurred as they did. It leads to hindsight bias because the explanation becomes easier for us to recall.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a causal model is a logical story or explanation of how events occurred, which aligns with the key point about it being a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Incorrect: While the student mentions that causal models lead to hindsight bias through easier recall, they miss the key mechanism that events seem more inevitable than they actually were once incorporated into a causal model.

Score: 0.5

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

After acquiring knowledge, we cannot simply erase it from our minds. Thus, when recalling how probable we believed an event was before it happened, we inevitably consider what we now know about the event. This leads to hindsight bias, where we fail to remember our original thoughts and instead believe we predicted or understood the outcome all along.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly explains that newly learned information cannot be avoided when estimating past likelihood judgments, which is the core mechanism of how learning contributes to hindsight bias. The answer demonstrates understanding that acquired knowledge inevitably influences retrospective probability assessments, leading to the inability to accurately recall original predictions.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

- Maximizing involves striving to make the optimal decision and is linked to neuroticism, while satisficing means choosing an option that is adequate and tends to lead to higher contentment. - She is more inclined to use a maximizing approach.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies maximizing as striving to make the optimal decision, which aligns with 'trying to make the best choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly describes satisficing as choosing an option that is adequate, which matches 'making a good-enough choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly states that someone high in neuroticism is more inclined to use a maximizing approach, matching the answer key's requirement.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

I would create mandatory questionnaires for each chapter and require their completion. At the end of each week, I would share students' quiz rankings to encourage competition and reward those who prepared while discouraging those who didn't, applying operant conditioning. Additionally, I would offer the option to join smaller study groups on Brightspace, as, based on expected utility theory, students might prefer relying less on their own motivation and benefit from group support and accountability. I would also provide podcasts featuring useful information or lectures in audio format, since they are easily accessible and many students enjoy listening to podcasts during activities like cooking, walking, or biking.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement with the question by proposing multiple concrete strategies that address the core challenge of promoting active engagement with limited resources. The answer shows thoughtful application of course concepts (operant conditioning, expected utility theory) and presents practical, scalable solutions including automated questionnaires, study groups, and accessible podcast content. The response reflects genuine consideration of both pedagogical principles and practical constraints.
