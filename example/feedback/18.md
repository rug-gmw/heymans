# Exam grade and feedback for 18

Grade: 8.0

## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

System One operates quickly, relying on shortcuts and emotions, while System Two is slower and more logical. System One tends to be more influential because it depends on intuition and feelings, similar to how moral judgments are formed. Moral judgments often stem from gut feelings and emotions. For example, the instinctive sense that sexual relations between siblings are wrong comes from intuition, even if it's difficult to rationally explain why it feels so unacceptable.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 operates quickly and relies on emotions/intuition, which aligns with the answer key's requirement that System 1 refers to intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student correctly describes System 2 as slower and more logical, which corresponds to the answer key's requirement that System 2 refers to reasoning/rational thought.
- Correct: The student clearly states that System 1 tends to be more influential and explains that moral judgments often stem from gut feelings and emotions, demonstrating understanding that System 1/intuition is more dominant than System 2/reasoning.

Score: 1.0

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

Representativeness heuristic is a mental shortcut that determines whether A is B by judging if A resembles B. Stereotypes and prototypes arise from this heuristic. For example, when meeting a new colleague, you might wonder if they are your boss or a coworker. In your mind, a boss is typically older, dressed in a suit, and speaks formally. If the new colleague doesn’t match this image—being younger and casually dressed—you conclude they are likely a coworker rather than the boss.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive mechanism, demonstrating understanding of the specific heuristic involved in the scenario.
- Correct: The student provides a clear explanation of how the representativeness heuristic works by judging similarity to stereotypes/prototypes, and gives a relevant example that illustrates the concept of estimating category membership based on resemblance to typical characteristics.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

The primacy effect refers to the significance of first impressions, which carry more weight than people often realize. Even when new information is presented, it's difficult to let go of your initial perception of a person or object, no matter how different the new information is. Anchoring relates to having a reference point based on that first or early impression. For example, if you see an item priced at 5 euros, that price becomes your anchor. When you later see the same item priced at 10 euros, it seems very expensive compared to your anchor. Both concepts emphasize the importance of the initial impression.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes anchoring as having a reference point based on first impressions, but doesn't clearly explain it as the tendency to use the first piece of information as a starting point for judgments or decisions.
- Incorrect: The student describes primacy effect as the significance of first impressions that are hard to change, but doesn't identify it as the tendency to better remember the first piece of information.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both concepts emphasize the importance of the initial impression, which aligns with the overreliance on first information.

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion means that losing feels more impactful than gaining an equivalent amount (losing 100 euros feels worse than winning 110 euros feels good). Risk aversion refers to a preference for certainty over uncertainty, which is why people are generally reluctant to take risks.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly explains loss aversion as losses being more impactful than equivalent gains, providing a clear example with specific amounts (losing 100 euros vs winning 110 euros).
- Correct: The student accurately defines risk aversion as preferring certainty over uncertainty and connects this to people's general reluctance to take risks.

Score: 1.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias refers to the tendency to overestimate the intensity and duration of future emotional responses. In this case, it relates to ending a relationship. For instance, if Kees is unhappy in his relationship, he may avoid breaking up because he believes the emotional distress will be much stronger and last longer than it actually will.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies impact bias as overestimating future emotional responses, which aligns with the answer key's definition of overestimating the impact of future events on feelings.
- Correct: The student provides a clear example explaining how impact bias prevents breakups by making people believe the emotional distress will be stronger and longer-lasting than reality, which matches the answer key's point about overestimating how bad a breakup will feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting refers to predicting how you will feel in the future about a certain event, often overestimating how negative those feelings will be. This concept is significant for end-of-life decisions because people tend to believe they will feel worse than they actually do and might think they want to end their life. However, when that time arrives, individuals usually find their experience is not as bad as anticipated, and they do not want to end their life. Therefore, considering affective forecasting is crucial in making end-of-life choices.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines affective forecasting as predicting future emotional states about events, which aligns with the answer key's definition of predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Correct: The student accurately captures the core concept that healthy people may predict they'll prefer to die when sick, but when actually experiencing illness, they typically don't want to die - demonstrating understanding of the discrepancy between predicted and actual preferences.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

Prospect theory suggests that individuals tend to overvalue small probabilities, which helps explain why activities like the 'vriendenloterij' remain popular. However, there is a distinction between low probabilities and extremely low probabilities; the latter are often perceived as impossible, so people do not overestimate them.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that prospect theory suggests people overvalue/overestimate small/low probabilities, which aligns with the answer key point about merely low probabilities being overestimated.
- Correct: The student accurately distinguishes between low and extremely low probabilities, correctly stating that extremely low probabilities are perceived as impossible and thus not overestimated, matching the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Losing something feels worse than gaining the same amount feels good. For example, people perceive losing 100 euros as more painful than the pleasure of winning 110 euros, leading them to do anything to avoid losses. According to prospect theory, this results in people taking riskier actions and being less risk-averse when facing potential losses.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion means losses are felt more strongly than equivalent gains, which reflects that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. The example of losing 100 euros feeling worse than gaining 110 euros demonstrates understanding of the steeper value function for losses than gains.

Score: 1.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

- Expected value theory focuses solely on value and ignores individual preferences. - Expected value theory is objective, whereas expected utility theory is subjective.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions that expected value theory ignores individual preferences, but doesn't specifically address the key distinction that expected value deals only with financial values while expected utility deals with both financial and non-financial values.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory is objective while expected utility theory is subjective, which captures the essence that expected utility theory considers risk aversion and individual preferences while expected value theory does not.

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

- Expected value theory focuses solely on the proportions and values involved, without considering utility or the personal significance of an outcome.  
- Expected utility theory accounts for the varying importance of different factors. For example, when deciding on a new job, someone might prioritize location more than colleagues, so location is given greater weight in the decision-making process.  
- MAUT (Multi-Attribute Utility Theory) is similar to expected utility theory but involves evaluating several attributes. In this case, besides colleagues and location, factors like salary and the number of workdays per week are also considered.  
- Prospect theory deals with loss aversion. It explains why someone who chooses option A over B might not make a similar choice between D and C, even if D and A seem comparable. Instead, individuals may choose C over D because they tend to take greater risks to avoid losses.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as focusing on proportions and values without considering personal significance, which aligns with the normative model dealing with financial outcomes and probabilities.
- Incorrect: The student confuses expected utility theory with multi-attribute utility theory. Expected utility theory is about subjective utility of outcomes (not financial), while the student describes weighting different factors, which is actually MAUT.
- Correct: The student correctly describes MAUT as involving multiple attributes with different considerations (salary, workdays, etc.), which matches the answer key's description of multiple attributes with utilities and weights.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies prospect theory as a descriptive model involving loss aversion and risk-taking behavior to avoid losses, which aligns with the behavioral model that considers heuristics and biases.

Score: 0.75

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

People generally prefer certainty over uncertainty, except when it comes to loss aversion. In cases of loss aversion, individuals tend to take greater risks than they would in other scenarios.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion makes people take greater risks than they normally would, which aligns with the key point that loss aversion can decrease risk aversion and make people risk seeking when facing potential losses.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning is a type of learning. Classical conditioning involves learning that one stimulus predicts another event—for example, a dog learns to associate the sound of a bell with food and begins to wag its tail in anticipation. Operant conditioning, on the other hand, occurs when learning happens through receiving rewards or punishments, influencing whether a behavior is repeated or avoided in the future.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as a type of learning, which aligns with the answer key's definition of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as learning that one stimulus predicts another event, demonstrating understanding of temporal/spatial associations between stimuli.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning through rewards or punishments that influence future behavior, matching the key concept that actions cause consequences.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

- Illusory causation occurs when you believe one event causes another, but this impression is actually due to regression to the mean.  
- Illusory correlation happens when you assume one event causes another and notice a correlation, but in reality, it is just a coincidence.  
Illusory correlation arises from chance, whereas illusory causation stems from regression to the mean.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student confuses the concepts. They incorrectly define illusory causation as being due to regression to the mean, and illusory correlation as assuming causation. The correct distinction is that illusory causation involves misinterpreting real correlations as causal relationships, while illusory correlation involves perceiving correlations that don't actually exist.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

Schema refers to understanding the structure of the Dutch healthcare system. It is considered a schema because it involves knowledge of a broad concept rather than guidelines for a particular occasion or behavior. For example, the entire Dutch healthcare system represents a larger framework, unlike a specific event such as a birthday party. In contrast, a script outlines the appropriate behavior to follow at a birthday party. It is called a script because it provides detailed instructions for conduct in a specific situation. Essentially, a script is a type of schema, but it is more focused and event-specific.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that understanding the Dutch healthcare system is a schema and provides appropriate reasoning that it involves knowledge of a broad concept and represents a larger framework, which aligns with the answer key's explanation about schemas corresponding to knowledge and relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script and provides sound reasoning that it provides detailed instructions for conduct in a specific situation, which matches the answer key's explanation about scripts being social schemas that describe behavior in specific situations.

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

Physical stance: it focuses on how the mind and external stimuli cause behavior, emphasizing physical aspects.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that behaviorists adopted the physical stance and provides accurate reasoning, noting that it focuses on how stimuli cause behavior and emphasizes physical aspects, which aligns with the behaviorist emphasis on observable stimulus-response relationships.

Score: 1.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

Stance intuition refers to understanding the reasons behind people's behavior. In this context, it matters because you tend to support your own groups.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student does not correctly identify the design stance as the level of analysis used by evolutionary psychologists. Instead, they appear to confuse Dennett's stances with general concepts about understanding behavior, and they don't explain how evolutionary psychology considers psychological processes in terms of their function.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

- plausible: something that is likely according to your understanding - distinct - consistent across different times and locations - cause and effect -

Feedback:

- Incorrect: Student mentions 'distinct' but doesn't explain distinctness/specificity correctly - should explain that B follows A but not other events.
- Incorrect: Student mentions 'consistent across different times and locations' but this conflates consistency with contiguity - consistency means B always follows A, not about locations.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies plausibility as something likely according to understanding, which matches the answer key concept.
- Incorrect: Student mentions consistency being 'across different times and locations' which partially touches on contiguity but doesn't clearly explain temporal and spatial proximity.
- Incorrect: Student only mentions 'cause and effect' without explaining similarity between cause and effect - doesn't address that A and B should superficially resemble each other.

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

Framework theories involve how we comprehend the world and its different areas. When something moves from one area to another, a kind of magical transfer might occur. For example, if you dislike a person, you won't consciously see them in an object that belonged to them, but mentally, you associate the object with that person, which is why you may reject it.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that this involves the misapplication of concepts from one domain (biological contagion) to another domain (social/psychological), explaining how mental association creates an irrational transfer of properties from person to object.

Score: 1.0

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

Being aware that you're mistaken, yet continuing to believe it.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's answer focuses on awareness of being mistaken while continuing to believe, which describes a different psychological phenomenon. The answer key requires understanding that delusional conspiracy theories are both irrational beliefs AND not commonly accepted, which the student did not address.

Score: 0.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

- narcissistic - lacking intelligence - curious about and attempting to explain things that are difficult or impossible to clarify

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identified narcissism as a personality factor contributing to conspiratorial thinking, which directly matches the answer key.
- Correct: The student mentioned 'lacking intelligence' which corresponds to 'having a low level of intelligence' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student's description of 'curious about and attempting to explain things that are difficult or impossible to clarify' aligns with 'believing in simple explanations for complex events' from the answer key.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Counterfactual debunking: initially, you understand which information is accurate and which is false, but after about 30 minutes, you no longer remember whether the information was right or wrong, or you mistakenly believe incorrect information is correct. Additionally, the conflicting answers disrupt the learning process.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the core mechanism of source amnesia - forgetting whether information was correct or incorrect and potentially mistaking incorrect answers for correct ones. The reference to '30 minutes' shows understanding of the temporal aspect, and mentioning that conflicting answers disrupt learning aligns with interference concepts from the answer key.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

The availability heuristic involves making judgments based on how quickly examples come to mind. For instance, a plane crash is widely reported in the news, whereas car accidents are not covered as extensively. Because of this, it's easier to recall plane crashes than car accidents, which may lead you to mistakenly believe that plane crashes occur more frequently than car accidents, even though that's not the case. Similarly, repeated statements are easier to remember than those heard less frequently, influencing your perception.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student only explains the availability heuristic and its relationship to memory/recall, but does not identify the specific psychological mechanism asked for in the question (mere exposure effect or illusory-truth effect). The answer fails to address how repetition makes messages more attractive beyond just being more memorable.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

No, it actually increases their accuracy. While many people believe that negative events won't affect them, individuals with major depressive disorder do not hold this belief, making their perceptions more realistic.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that major depressive disorder increases accuracy in predictions about negative events and provides the correct mechanism - that depressed individuals lack the typical optimistic bias that leads most people to underestimate their risk of negative events, making their predictions more realistic.

Score: 1.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

The prior will carry greater significance.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that prior beliefs become more influential when sensory information is less reliable, which matches the core concept from the answer key.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

- Pre-conventional: "If you help me, I'll help you." There's a sense of morality, but it mainly revolves around personal gain.  
- Conventional: Acting with consideration for others, even when there's no direct benefit to yourself.  
- Post-conventional: Adhering to a broader, more universal set of moral principles.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the pre-conventional level as focused on personal gain and reciprocal benefits, which aligns with the answer key's description of obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as acting with consideration for others without direct personal benefit, which matches the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the post-conventional level as adhering to universal moral principles, which aligns with the answer key's description of focus on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model is one where one event leads to another. Hindsight bias refers to the feeling that you "knew it all along" after an event's outcome is known, even though you actually did not. For example, before a match between Ajax and Feyenoord, you don't know who will win. After Ajax wins, you believe you predicted their victory and have reasons to support that belief. You feel you "knew it all along," but in reality, you did not. Since one event causes another (as in a causal model), you cannot easily imagine the event not happening, which makes you think you "knew it all along."

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student defines a causal model as 'one where one event leads to another' which is too simplistic. The answer key requires understanding that a causal model is 'a coherent narrative of how past events are related' - a more comprehensive explanation involving interconnected events forming a coherent story, not just simple cause-and-effect chains.
- Correct: The student correctly explains how causal models contribute to hindsight bias by noting that when events are causally connected, 'you cannot easily imagine the event not happening, which makes you think you knew it all along.' This captures the key idea that events in a causal model seem more inevitable than they actually were.

Score: 0.5

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Once an event has occurred, you gain new information and learn from it. When you reflect on your original prediction about the outcome (for example, who would win), you cannot ignore the new information you now have. As a result, when you reconsider who you believed would win, your thinking isn’t as clear as it was before the event, since you can’t set aside the new knowledge. This is why you might feel like you “knew it all along.”

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly explains that newly learned information cannot be avoided when estimating past likelihood judgments, which is the core mechanism of hindsight bias described in the answer key. The explanation captures how new knowledge interferes with recalling original predictions, leading to the 'knew it all along' phenomenon.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

The maximizing style involves seeking the very best option, while the satisficing style aims for an outcome that is sufficiently satisfactory. Individuals who score high in the neuroticism personality trait are more likely to adopt a maximizing decision style.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as seeking the very best option, which aligns with the answer key's description of trying to make the best choice.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as aiming for a sufficiently satisfactory outcome, which matches the answer key's definition of making a good-enough choice.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that individuals high in neuroticism are more likely to adopt a maximizing decision style, which directly matches the answer key.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

I would create a practice exam with the correct answers available online. There would also be time during the final lecture for students to ask questions. I would avoid using AI to grade the exam. If I were short on time, I would include both multiple-choice and some open-ended questions. However, if I had enough time, I would only use open-ended questions and grade them myself, as I believe this provides a better understanding of a student's knowledge than AI grading does. We also had a practice session on a topic of our choice, and I would have other students provide feedback since giving feedback is a valuable learning experience.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement by providing multiple concrete strategies: practice exams with answer keys, Q&A sessions, peer feedback activities, and thoughtful consideration of assessment methods (balancing multiple-choice vs open-ended questions based on time constraints). The response shows understanding of pedagogical principles like the value of peer feedback as a learning experience and reflects on trade-offs between different approaches.
