## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

The social-intuitionist model of moral judgment suggests that system 1 plays a more prominent role because it involves intuitive thinking. Additionally, system 1 operates more quickly, which is frequently necessary in social contexts. In contrast, system 2 is associated with deliberate, complex, and slower reasoning.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 involves intuitive thinking, which aligns with the answer key's requirement that System 1 refers to intuitions.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies System 2 as involving 'deliberate, complex, and slower reasoning,' which matches the answer key's description of System 2 as reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student clearly states that 'system 1 plays a more prominent role,' which directly addresses that System 1 is more dominant than System 2 according to Haidt's model.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

This assumption is based on the representativeness heuristic, which occurs when you categorize people or objects according to existing stereotypes or prototypes. Since you have a mental image of what a fashion model looks like, and your colleague matches that image, you assume they must be a fashion model.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process in this scenario.
- Correct: The student provides an accurate explanation of the representativeness heuristic, describing how we categorize people based on how well they match our stereotypes or prototypes, which aligns with the answer key's explanation about estimating likelihood based on resemblance to stereotypes.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring is the process where initial information serves as a reference point for evaluating subsequent information (for example, noticing long lines on a screen might lead you to estimate the Mississippi River as longer compared to seeing shorter lines). The primacy effect refers to the tendency to better recall the first piece of information presented compared to later details. Both concepts are alike in that they emphasize the impact of the first piece of information on memory or judgment.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as using initial information as a reference point, which aligns with the answer key's description of taking the first piece of information as the starting point. The example provided demonstrates understanding of the concept.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as the tendency to better recall the first piece of information presented, which directly matches the answer key definition.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both concepts emphasize the impact of the first piece of information, which corresponds to the answer key's point about overreliance on first information, though using slightly different wording.

Score: 1.0

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency to strongly avoid losses because they feel more significant than equivalent gains. Risk aversion involves steering clear of uncertainty and potential negative outcomes, such as facing a 70% chance of winning $5 and a 30% chance of losing $5, due to a dislike of unpredictability.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves weighing losses more heavily than equivalent gains, capturing the core concept accurately.
- Incorrect: The student conflates risk aversion with loss aversion by focusing on avoiding negative outcomes rather than the preference for certainty over uncertainty regardless of whether outcomes are positive or negative.

Score: 0.5

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias occurs when individuals overestimate the intensity of their emotions following a decision. As a result, they may avoid ending relationships because they anticipate severe negative emotions, even though they may actually feel better afterward.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies impact bias as overestimating the intensity of emotions following future events/decisions, which matches the key concept of overestimating impact on future feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly explains that impact bias prevents breakups because people anticipate severe negative emotions from breaking up, which aligns with overestimating how bad a breakup will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves anticipating the emotions we think we will feel in the future. This concept is crucial for end-of-life choices because we often assume we will feel negative emotions in situations like having dementia, yet we may actually experience positive feelings during that time. Consequently, the decisions we make earlier in life might not align with how we truly feel later on, highlighting its significance in end-of-life planning.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines affective forecasting as anticipating or predicting future emotions, which aligns with the answer key's definition of 'predictions about our own future emotional state.'
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of the core concept by explaining that healthy people may assume they'll feel negative emotions in situations like dementia but may actually experience positive feelings, and that earlier decisions might not align with later feelings. This captures the essence of the answer key's point about healthy people predicting they'll prefer to die when sick, but not actually preferring to die when they become sick.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

Prospect theory suggests that individuals tend to undervalue small probabilities, particularly those that are extremely low (0.01%), often treating them as if they have a zero chance of occurring. Even moderately low probabilities (around 10%) are underestimated, with most people believing they probably do not fall within those less likely outcomes. Thus, there is a subtle distinction between how people perceive moderately low and extremely low probabilities.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student states that moderately low probabilities (10%) are underestimated, but according to prospect theory, merely low probabilities are actually overestimated, not underestimated.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that extremely low probabilities (0.01%) are often treated as having zero chance of occurring, which aligns with the answer key point about interpreting them as impossibilities.

Score: 0.5

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion is connected to negative utility since we tend to experience loss aversion when something is perceived as having negative utility. Loss inherently carries negative utility.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly explains loss aversion as simply being about negative utility from losses. The correct answer requires understanding that loss aversion means losses are weighted more heavily than equivalent gains - i.e., the value function is steeper for losses than gains. The student misses this key asymmetric weighting concept.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory focuses solely on the anticipated monetary outcome, whereas expected utility theory extends beyond money by assigning a utility value to all factors pertinent to a decision.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory focuses on monetary outcomes while expected utility theory extends beyond financial values to include broader utility considerations.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention the key distinction regarding heuristics/biases and risk aversion, which is the second main difference according to the answer key.

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

- expected value model: choices are based on their monetary value - expected utility model: choices are based on their anticipated utility - prospect theory: similar to expected utility theory but incorporates heuristics and biases - behavioral life-cycle hypothesis: expands further on prospect theory by examining how these decisions occur throughout a person’s lifetime

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as being based on monetary value, but fails to mention that it's a normative model involving probabilities of different financial outcomes.
- Incorrect: The student correctly identifies expected utility theory as being based on anticipated utility, but doesn't explain that it's like expected value theory except outcomes have subjective utility beyond just financial value.
- Incorrect: The student mentions prospect theory and correctly notes it incorporates heuristics and biases, but fails to identify multi-attribute utility theory as a separate model with multiple attributes, utilities, and weights.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies 'behavioral life-cycle hypothesis' as the fourth model instead of prospect theory. This is not one of the four models from the answer key.

Score: 0.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

In loss aversion, individuals perceive losses as more significant than gains of the same size. As a result, to prevent the unpleasant emotions associated with potential losses, they tend to avoid taking risks. When situations are presented negatively, people are more likely to exhibit risk-averse behavior.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that loss aversion makes people more risk-averse when situations are framed negatively. The correct answer is that loss aversion can actually decrease risk aversion and make people risk-seeking when they face potential losses, as people become willing to accept risk to avoid those losses.

Score: 0.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning occurs when you link one stimulus to another through experience. Operant conditioning is illustrated by the famous bell and dog experiment: when food is given to the dog while a bell rings, the dog eventually connects the bell with the food and begins to salivate at the sound of the bell alone, even without food present. Classical conditioning involves having a stimulus and a response, but if we connect that stimulus to a different response, our learning adapts to include this new reaction. For example, pain triggers fear, fire causes pain, so fire becomes something that elicits fear.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as linking stimuli through experience, which aligns with learning associations through covariation.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly describes the bell and dog experiment as operant conditioning when it is actually classical conditioning (Pavlov's experiment involving temporal association of stimuli).
- Incorrect: The student's description of classical conditioning as connecting a stimulus to a different response is somewhat accurate, but they fail to distinguish it from operant conditioning as learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation occurs when you believe that event A causes event B, even though no actual causal link exists and the connection may simply be due to chance. Illusory correlation happens when you think there is a correlation between A and B, regardless of whether the relationship is causal or nonexistent.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly describes illusory correlation as thinking there is a correlation regardless of causality, missing that it specifically refers to perceiving correlation where none actually exists. They also don't clearly distinguish that illusory causation involves misinterpreting an existing correlation as causal.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

Knowing the appropriate behavior at a birthday party follows a script, as there are implicit rules guiding how the event typically unfolds. In contrast, understanding the Dutch healthcare system serves as an example of a schema, which is a comprehensive set of guidelines often subconsciously understood by those who interact with the system.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that understanding the Dutch healthcare system is a schema and provides a reasonable explanation that it represents a comprehensive set of guidelines and knowledge, which aligns with the concept of schemas as knowledge structures about relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that knowing appropriate behavior at a birthday party is a script and explains it involves implicit rules for how events unfold, which accurately captures the concept of scripts as behavioral sequences for specific situations.

Score: 1.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

The physical stance aligns closely with the behaviorist perspective because it focuses on observable actions rather than internal mental processes.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that behaviorists adopted the physical stance and provides appropriate reasoning - they focused on observable actions (behaviors) rather than internal mental processes (the mind), which aligns with the behaviorist emphasis on measurable stimuli and responses.

Score: 1.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

The mechanical perspective is closely associated with evolutionary psychologists, as it focuses on the adaptive value of behaviors.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the 'mechanical perspective' as the stance adopted by evolutionary psychologists. According to Dennett's stances, evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance because they focus on function and purpose, not the mechanical/physical stance which deals with physical mechanisms and processes.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

- Confirmation bias: We believe there is a causal or correlational link between A and B, so we look for information that supports this belief. - Availability heuristic: When certain information is easier to recall, such as knowing A leads to B but forgetting that C intervenes, we are more likely to assume a direct causal or correlational connection between A and B. - Hindsight bias: After an event occurs, we tend to view the relationship between A and B as obvious or clearly causal/correlational. - Anchoring and adjustment: Once we learn about a causal or correlational link between A and B, it becomes challenging to revise that initial belief. - Consistency: If A always results in B, we are inclined to infer a causal relationship. - Distinctiveness: If only A causes B, this leads us to assume a causal link between them.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: Student mentions 'distinctiveness' which is similar to distinctness/specificity, but provides 6 heuristics instead of 5 and includes irrelevant cognitive biases not from the answer key.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies consistency and provides an accurate explanation that matches the answer key.
- Incorrect: Student does not mention plausibility at all, instead discussing unrelated cognitive biases like confirmation bias and availability heuristic.
- Incorrect: Student does not mention contiguity in time and space, which is a key heuristic from the answer key.
- Incorrect: Student does not mention similarity in cause and effect, instead focusing on cognitive biases not relevant to the five heuristics.

Score: 0.2

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

The availability heuristic occurs when we assume something is more common simply because it comes to mind more easily, which can happen with recent events or, in this case, because morally outraged comments evoke stronger emotions and are therefore more memorable. Negativity bias means we tend to view the world more negatively than it truly is. Additionally, morally outraged posts or comments often generate high engagement on social media, leading algorithms to deem them popular and display them to a wider audience.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions negativity bias but defines it incorrectly as 'viewing the world more negatively than it truly is' rather than as the tendency to seek out or place more weight on negative information.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies and defines the availability heuristic as assuming something is more common because it comes to mind more easily, and appropriately connects it to memorable morally outraged content.
- Incorrect: While the student mentions some relevant connections between moral outrage and social media algorithms, they do not clearly explain how negativity bias and availability heuristic work together to cause overestimation of moral outrage.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

The idea of magical contagion from someone you dislike is viewed negatively. Therefore, it has a negative context, which might be connected to concepts like loss aversion.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student discusses loss aversion and negative context but fails to identify the key concept: that biological contagion frameworks are being incorrectly applied to social/psychological domains. The answer doesn't address framework theories or domain-specific knowledge transfer.

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A non-delusional conspiracy is one believed by most people, whereas a delusional conspiracy theory is accepted by only a small number of individuals.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student only addresses the 'commonly accepted' criterion but misses the crucial 'irrational belief' component. According to the answer key, a conspiracy theory is delusional when it is BOTH irrational AND not commonly accepted - the student's answer lacks the rationality/irrationality distinction.

Score: 0.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

Individuals who are drawn to conspiracy theories generally have lower trust in authorities, such as the government and scientific community (COVID-19 being a clear example). In terms of the Big Five personality traits, these individuals often score high in Agreeableness because they are more susceptible to influence from those around them. The anchoring-and-adjustment heuristic also plays a role, as the initial information we encounter heavily shapes how we interpret subsequent information; therefore, if our first exposure is to a conspiracy theory, we are more inclined to accept it as true, which is also connected to confirmation bias. Confirmation bias further contributes by leading us to seek out information that supports our existing beliefs while ignoring evidence that contradicts them.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions 'lower trust in authorities' which is not listed among the specific cognitive and personality factors in the answer key. While related to conspiratorial thinking, this doesn't match the required factors.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that conspiracy theorists score high in Agreeableness, but the answer key specifies narcissism as a personality factor. High Agreeableness would actually contradict narcissistic tendencies.
- Incorrect: The student discusses anchoring-and-adjustment heuristic and confirmation bias, but these are not among the specific factors listed in the answer key. The answer key focuses on different cognitive biases like seeing patterns in randomness and attributing agency incorrectly.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Because of anchoring-and-adjustment, your initial wrong answer serves as a reference point that influences all subsequent responses you provide. Although you can modify your information, the anchoring effect is strong and hard to overcome.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes anchoring-and-adjustment, which is a cognitive bias about numerical estimates being influenced by initial values. However, the answer key requires explanation of source amnesia (forgetting the source of information and mistaking incorrect answers for correct ones) or proactive interference (old incorrect information interfering with new correct information). Anchoring-and-adjustment does not explain how incorrect answers interfere with learning the correct material.

Score: 0.0

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

They attempt to leverage the familiarity heuristic or bias by repeating their message—meaning that when you encounter something frequently, it feels familiar and is more readily recalled, leading you to believe it is accurate.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the psychological mechanism as familiarity-based processing through repetition. While they use the term 'familiarity heuristic' rather than 'mere exposure effect,' they accurately describe the core concept that repeated exposure leads to increased preference and perceived accuracy, which matches the answer key's explanation of mere exposure and its alternative, the illusory-truth effect.

Score: 1.0

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Yes, since they often view the world pessimistically, their forecasts are more prone to being negative and therefore less precise.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that depression makes predictions less accurate due to pessimistic bias, when the answer key indicates that depressed individuals are actually MORE accurate because they have reduced optimistic bias compared to non-depressed people.

Score: 0.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

When sensory information is unreliable, your prior beliefs play a greater role in shaping your perception, causing your perception to align more closely with those prior beliefs.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when sensory information is unreliable, prior beliefs have a greater influence on perception, which directly matches the key concept from the answer key.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

- Pre-conventional: This stage is common among children, where their sense of right and wrong is shaped by authority figures (e.g., "Pushing my sister is wrong because my parents would scold me"). - Conventional: At this stage, which includes most individuals, moral judgments are guided by the opinions and expectations of others. - Post-conventional: Here, moral reasoning is guided by personal principles rather than external opinions, representing a more advanced level of thinking that few people, like scholars, typically reach.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the pre-conventional level as being shaped by authority figures and avoiding punishment (scolding), which aligns with the answer key's description of obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as being guided by opinions and expectations of others, which matches the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the post-conventional level as being guided by personal principles rather than external opinions, which aligns with the answer key's description of focus on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

The causal model of past events refers to recognizing the cause-and-effect link between A and B only after the event has happened. This leads to hindsight bias because, in retrospect, the connection seems obvious, but we often overlook that we didn’t perceive it beforehand.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes causal models as recognizing cause-and-effect links after events happen, but doesn't capture that a causal model is a coherent narrative of how past events are related. The focus is too narrow on simple A-B connections rather than broader narrative structure.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that causal models contribute to hindsight bias by making connections seem obvious in retrospect that weren't perceived beforehand, which aligns with the concept that events seem more inevitable than they actually were.

Score: 0.5

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

When we learn, we revise our previous knowledge with new information, which leads to hindsight bias. This bias occurs because, with the new information, it seems more apparent that the outcome was predictable all along.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that learning involves incorporating new information that affects how we evaluate past events, making outcomes seem more predictable in retrospect. This captures the core mechanism of hindsight bias where newly acquired knowledge contaminates our ability to accurately recall or estimate our previous state of knowledge.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing involves choosing the most ideal and optimal option, while satisficing means selecting a decision that is adequate or satisfactory. Individuals who score high in neuroticism tend to prefer the maximizing approach to decision-making.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as choosing the most ideal and optimal option, which aligns with 'trying to make the best choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as selecting a decision that is adequate or satisfactory, which matches 'making a good-enough choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that individuals high in neuroticism tend to prefer the maximizing approach, which matches the answer key's expectation.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

You can encourage students to actively participate by assigning a group project that requires documenting a timeline of each member's contributions. Since grading time is limited, the assignment should be pass/fail, with passing contingent on genuine engagement with the material. Another method to ensure serious involvement is to use short-answer exams evaluated by AI, which can save considerable grading time. Additionally, making lectures more interactive—such as incorporating questions throughout or using tools like Kahoot at the end—can increase student participation and improve retention through the availability heuristic.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement by providing multiple concrete strategies that address the core challenge of promoting active engagement with limited resources. They propose group projects with documented contributions, pass/fail grading systems, AI-assisted evaluation, and interactive lecture elements like Kahoot. The answer shows thoughtful consideration of practical constraints and incorporates course concepts like the availability heuristic, indicating genuine reflection on the question.
