## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

System 1 corresponds to moral intuition and is the primary influence when making moral judgments before any deliberate thinking occurs. System 2 is involved in moral reasoning, but it comes into play afterward, such as when there is sufficient time for reflection or when a person lacks a strong initial moral intuition. Additionally, the 'wag-the-tail' effect refers to situations where individuals believe their opinions stem from deliberate moral reasoning (system 2), but in reality, they are driven by their intuition and emotions (system 1).

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 corresponds to moral intuition, which aligns with the answer key's requirement that System 1 refers to intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 2 is involved in moral reasoning, which matches the answer key's requirement that System 2 refers to reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student clearly states that System 1 is the 'primary influence' in moral judgments and explains the 'wag-the-tail' effect where people think they're using System 2 but are actually driven by System 1, demonstrating understanding that System 1/intuition is more dominant.

Score: 1.0

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

The assumption is based on the representativeness heuristic, which involves judging the likelihood that a person fits into a certain group by how closely they match our idea of that group. For instance, if we see a stylish coworker, we might believe he is a model because he strongly resembles what we think a model looks like.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process in this scenario.
- Correct: The student provides an accurate explanation of the representativeness heuristic, describing how we estimate likelihood of category membership based on resemblance to stereotypes, and gives a relevant example that demonstrates understanding.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring is the idea that our beliefs are influenced by an initial piece of information we receive. Later information is interpreted in relation to this initial anchor and used to modify our belief. The primacy effect highlights how the sequence of information impacts our impression of someone. For instance, if you learn from a friend that a new acquaintance wronged them, this first piece of information serves as an anchor, and due to the primacy effect, your overall opinion will be shaped primarily by that negative fact, with subsequent information viewed through that lens.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as being influenced by initial information that serves as a starting point, though they elaborate with belief modification which goes beyond the basic definition.
- Incorrect: The student describes primacy effect in terms of sequence impact on impressions rather than the tendency to better remember first information. They confuse primacy effect with anchoring bias in impression formation.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding that both concepts involve overreliance on first information through their example showing how initial negative information dominates subsequent impressions.

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to placing greater importance on small gains and losses, whereas risk aversion is the tendency to favor certainty instead of uncertainty.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly describes loss aversion as placing greater importance on 'small gains and losses' rather than the key concept that losses are weighted more heavily than equivalent gains.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies risk aversion as the tendency to favor certainty over uncertainty, which matches the answer key.

Score: 0.5

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias is a type of affective forecasting where people tend to exaggerate how much future events will influence their emotions. For instance, someone considering ending a relationship may be held back by impact bias because they overestimate the emotional toll the breakup will take. However, in reality, they might feel better afterward since the cause of their unhappiness has been removed.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as exaggerating how much future events will influence emotions, which matches the answer key's definition of overestimating the impact of future events on future feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly explains that impact bias prevents breakups because people overestimate the emotional toll/impact of breaking up, which aligns with the answer key's point about overestimating how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting is the capacity to anticipate how we will feel in the future. It is crucial to take this into account in end-of-life choices because while decisions are made now for a future situation, when someone is actually ill, the disability paradox may occur: people often wouldn't make the same choices they made when healthy. Thus, it is essential for an individual to create a living will and seek the endorsement of multiple healthcare providers.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines affective forecasting as the capacity to anticipate how we will feel in the future, which matches the answer key's definition of predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of the core concept by explaining that healthy people make different choices than when actually ill, referencing the disability paradox, which aligns with the answer key's point about healthy people predicting they'd prefer to die when sick but changing preferences when actually sick.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

Prospect theory suggests that individuals tend to exaggerate the significance of low probabilities, leading to heightened fear. However, this changes with extremely low probabilities, which people frequently regard as impossible. As a result, when faced with a dread risk that has an extremely low chance of occurring, they often dismiss it as impossible, overlooking the tiny but potentially disastrous risk.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that low probabilities are overestimated, describing this as 'exaggerate the significance of low probabilities' which aligns with the answer key's point about overestimation.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that extremely low probabilities are treated as impossibilities, stating 'people frequently regard as impossible' and 'dismiss it as impossible,' which matches the answer key's second point.

Score: 1.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

In prospect theory, loss aversion plays a greater role in determining objective utility. Unlike the expected utility theory, which is depicted by a straight, constant line, prospect theory incorporates heuristics and biases, resulting in a line with multiple curves.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions that loss aversion plays a greater role and references curves in prospect theory, but fails to clearly state the key concept that negative utilities (losses) are weighted more heavily than positive utilities (gains), or that the value function is steeper for losses than gains.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

The key distinction is that expected value theory focuses solely on financial results, whereas expected utility theory accounts for any kind of subjective outcome. Consequently, expected value theory is primarily applied to specific economic or financial choices (and does not accurately reflect human behavior), while expected utility theory evaluates the utility of a wide range of subjective decisions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory focuses on financial results while expected utility theory deals with subjective outcomes (non-financial values). This matches the first point in the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student mentions that expected value theory doesn't accurately reflect human behavior, but fails to specifically address risk aversion or heuristics and biases as the key behavioral consideration in expected utility theory.

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

The four models include: - Expected value theory, a normative approach for selecting between various options, each associated with a financial result and a probability. - Expected utility theory, a normative approach for choosing among options, each having a subjective outcome and a probability. - Multi-attribute utility theory, a normative approach for decisions involving options that have subjective outcomes along with assigned weights and utilities. - Prospect theory, a descriptive model for decision-making that involves options with subjective outcomes and takes into account heuristics and biases.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as a normative model for choosing between options with financial outcomes and probabilities, matching the key elements from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes expected utility theory as a normative approach with subjective outcomes and probabilities, capturing the essence that utility doesn't need to be financial but can be subjective.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies multi-attribute utility theory as a normative model involving multiple attributes with weights and utilities, though they mention 'subjective outcomes' rather than 'multiple attributes' - the core concept is still captured.
- Correct: The student accurately describes prospect theory as a descriptive model that accounts for heuristics and biases, correctly distinguishing it as behavioral rather than normative and noting its consideration of cognitive factors.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Loss aversion influences how risk-averse individuals are by exaggerating or downplaying risks. For instance: - When a person feels confident about their future, they view situations with a gain perspective, tend to avoid risks, and lean towards moderate political opinions. - When a person is anxious about their future, they adopt a loss perspective, become more willing to take risks, and favor extreme political views. When people believe they understand a risk, they tend to be less fearful of it. If they think they can control the risk, they often underestimate its severity and potential impact, leading them to take more risks.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion can make people more willing to take risks when they adopt a loss perspective, which aligns with the key point that loss aversion decreases risk aversion and can make people risk seeking when trying to avoid potential losses.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves learning connections based on occurrences that happen together. Classical conditioning links two events that usually occur simultaneously, whereas operant conditioning connects behaviors with consequences like rewards or penalties.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as learning connections/associations based on things that happen together, which aligns with the answer key's definition of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as linking two events that occur simultaneously, which matches the answer key's explanation of learning to associate things that happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as connecting behaviors with consequences like rewards or penalties, which corresponds to the answer key's definition of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation is the frequent error of interpreting actual correlations as causal links when they are not. Illusory correlations involve the mistaken perception of correlations within causal relationships.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly identifies that illusory causation involves misinterpreting correlations as causal relationships, but incorrectly defines illusory correlation as mistaken perception of correlations within causal relationships. The answer key states that illusory correlation is perceiving correlation between variables that don't actually correlate, not about correlations within causal relationships.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

A schema is knowledge that represents the connections between concepts. Being part of framework theories, it can also denote smaller categories of knowledge. For instance, knowing how the Dutch healthcare system operates is an example of a schema. A script, on the other hand, is a type of social schema, which outlines generally accepted behaviors in specific situations. These scripts can follow a sequence, such as the steps involved in grocery shopping, but in cases like appropriate conduct at a birthday, simply recognizing it as a script is sufficient.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that understanding the Dutch healthcare system is a schema and provides an accurate explanation that schemas represent knowledge and connections between concepts.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script and accurately explains that scripts are social schemas that outline accepted behaviors in specific situations.

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

Behaviorists take an intentional stance, viewing individuals as rational creatures with beliefs and desires, while acknowledging that the mind itself cannot be directly measured. Rather than examining specific mental processes, they concentrate on how stimuli provoke behavior, recognizing each person as unique and focusing on the individual as a whole.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the intentional stance instead of the physical stance. The intentional stance involves attributing beliefs and desires to explain behavior, but behaviorists explicitly rejected studying mental states and instead focused on observable stimulus-response mechanisms, which corresponds to the physical stance.

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

Evolutionary psychologists take a functional perspective, assessing psychological processes based on their usefulness. They consider the role these processes play in evolution. For instance, displaying empathy and avoiding causing harm are seen as advantageous traits.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that evolutionary psychologists adopt a functional perspective by assessing psychological processes based on their usefulness and evolutionary role. While they don't explicitly use the term 'design stance,' they accurately describe the core concept that defines this stance - analyzing processes in terms of their function and purpose.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

To determine if event A is related to event B, we can use causal heuristics. For example, consider a cat purring as a result of being scratched. The likelihood of a correlation is higher if the event is: - Distinct (specific): the observed behavior is the cat purring when scratched - Consistent: the cat always purrs whenever it is scratched - Contiguous in time and space: the purring occurs from my own cat being scratched, not another cat - Similar in cause and effect: this doesn't apply in this case, but would in situations like a leg kicking causing a ball to move. In summary, even without concrete proof and lacking similarity in cause and effect, it can be inferred that the cat purrs because it is being scratched.

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies distinctness/specificity and explains it as the cat purring specifically when scratched, which matches the answer key concept that B follows A but not other events.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies consistency and explains it as the cat always purring when scratched, which aligns with the answer key that B always follows A.
- Incorrect: Student does not mention plausibility as a heuristic, which is a key component from the answer key about common sense making the causal relationship believable.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies contiguity in time and space, explaining it occurs from their own cat being scratched rather than another cat, demonstrating understanding of same time/location requirement.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies similarity in cause and effect, acknowledging it doesn't apply to their cat example but providing an appropriate alternative example of leg kicking causing ball movement.

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

The biases that lead us to overestimate the number of people who feel moral outrage include: the negativity bias, which causes negative content to have a stronger influence on our view of the issue; the confirmation bias, which makes frequent exposure to such content lead us to believe that others behave similarly in real life, skewing our perception; and the availability heuristic, which can also affect our judgment.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the negativity bias and provides an accurate description of how it causes negative content (including morally outraged content) to have stronger influence on our perceptions.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the availability heuristic as one of the two primary biases, though they provide less detail about how it specifically works compared to the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student does not explain the connection between the two biases - how negativity bias increases exposure to moral outrage examples, which then feeds into the availability heuristic to cause overestimation. They mention confirmation bias instead, which is not part of the answer key.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

Magical contagion is a superstition, meaning it is an irrational belief that goes against the natural laws. Such superstitions often arise when knowledge from one area is mistakenly applied to another, as seen in magical contagion. This concept combines real contagion (like the spread of viruses) with magic, which is not real.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that magical contagion involves the misapplication of knowledge from one domain (biological contagion/spread of viruses) to another domain (social/psychological realm where objects retain associations with their previous owners). The answer demonstrates understanding of how framework theories from different domains can be incorrectly transferred.

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A delusional conspiracy theory is characterized by being false and not commonly accepted, whereas a non-delusional conspiracy theory is supported by a large group of people and is therefore, by definition, not delusional (since a delusion is an irrational belief that lacks cultural acceptance).

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that a delusional conspiracy theory is characterized by being 'false and not commonly accepted.' The answer key specifies that the distinguishing factors are being 'irrational' and 'not commonly accepted.' The student substitutes 'false' for 'irrational,' which are different concepts - something can be irrational without necessarily being false, and the clinical definition of delusion focuses on irrationality rather than truth value.

Score: 0.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

Certain cognitive and personality traits associated with conspiratorial thinking include being male, exhibiting narcissistic tendencies, and perceiving patterns where none exist.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'being male' as a factor, which matches 'being a man' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'exhibiting narcissistic tendencies' which corresponds to 'being narcissistic' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'perceiving patterns where none exist' which matches 'seeing patterns in randomness' from the answer key.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

False information can hinder learning by causing a backfire effect when attempts are made to debunk it. For instance, during a flu vaccine campaign, individuals were initially able to distinguish between myths and facts. However, after just 30 minutes, some began to accept certain myths as true.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes the backfire effect with a flu vaccine example, but this doesn't address the specific mechanism asked about in the question. The question asks how incorrect answers during self-quizzing can interfere with later learning, and the answer key focuses on source amnesia (forgetting that your own answer was incorrect) or proactive interference (initial incorrect answers interfering with correct ones). The backfire effect relates to resistance to correction of misinformation, which is a different psychological mechanism than what's being asked.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

Besides relying on the availability heuristic, politicians aim to reinforce existing beliefs. By continuously repeating the same message, they increase the chances that people will accept it as true and become more confident in their opinions.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes reinforcement of beliefs and increased acceptance through repetition, but does not identify the specific psychological mechanism of mere exposure effect or illusory-truth effect that the answer key requires.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

When forecasting outcomes, individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) often exhibit a negativity bias, perceiving the world as more bleak than it really is. In a study examining how people update their beliefs after receiving positive or negative information, healthy individuals were more likely to revise their beliefs in response to positive information than negative. In contrast, those with MDD showed no such difference, indicating they tend to overestimate the chances of negative events occurring.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student answer contradicts the answer key by stating that people with MDD 'tend to overestimate the chances of negative events occurring' and exhibit 'negativity bias,' whereas the answer key indicates that people with MDD are actually more accurate at predictions due to reduced optimism bias, not less accurate due to pessimistic overestimation.

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

As the trustworthiness of sensory data diminishes, the evidence becomes less dependable, causing prior beliefs to weigh more heavily on the resulting perception, and thus the evidence plays a smaller role in shaping the perception.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when sensory information becomes less reliable (described as 'trustworthiness of sensory data diminishes'), prior beliefs have increased influence on perception ('prior beliefs to weigh more heavily on the resulting perception'). This directly addresses the core concept from the answer key.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

1. Pre-conventional - centered on personal gain, involving minimal consideration of others 2. Conventional - centered on adhering to laws and caring about others' views and emotions 3. Post-conventional - centered on overarching ethical principles that apply universally

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the pre-conventional level as focused on personal gain with minimal consideration of others, which aligns with the answer key's description of obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as adhering to laws and caring about others' views and emotions, which matches the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the post-conventional level as centered on overarching ethical principles that apply universally, which corresponds to the answer key's description of focus on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

In hindsight bias, causal models are the stories we create to explain events that occurred, rather than those that might have happened but didn't. As a result, after an event takes place, it becomes easier to generate reasons for what actually happened when reflecting on our prior expectations.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that causal models are explanatory stories/narratives about events that occurred, which aligns with the answer key's definition of a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding that causal models contribute to hindsight bias by making actual events seem more explainable/reasonable in retrospect, which corresponds to the answer key's point about events seeming more inevitable than they were.

Score: 1.0

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Learning relates to the curse of knowledge, which means that once we acquire new information, we cannot help but incorporate it, even when reflecting on past events. In the case of hindsight bias, when a person attempts to remember an outcome they believed was most probable, their view is influenced by the actual result, since they are already aware of it.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that learning contributes to hindsight bias through the curse of knowledge, explaining that once new information is acquired, it cannot be avoided when making judgments about past likelihood estimates. The student demonstrates understanding that knowledge of actual outcomes influences retrospective probability judgments.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

The maximizing decision style describes how individuals, faced with numerous options, often experience regret and dissatisfaction with their decisions. This relates to the choice overload effect, where an excess of options can be overwhelming. In contrast, the satisficing decision style involves selecting an option that is simply adequate. People usually feel satisfied when they have a moderate number of choices and choose an option that meets their needs sufficiently. Individuals who score high in neuroticism, a trait linked to emotional instability and perfectionism, are more likely to adopt a maximizing approach. They tend to carefully evaluate all options and may feel unhappy with their decision, dwelling on what the other alternatives might have offered.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes maximizing in terms of regret and dissatisfaction rather than the core definition of trying to make the best choice. While these can be consequences of maximizing, the fundamental concept is missing.
- Correct: The student correctly describes satisficing as selecting an option that is adequate or meets needs sufficiently, which aligns with making a good-enough choice.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that individuals high in neuroticism are more likely to adopt a maximizing approach, mentioning relevant traits like perfectionism and careful evaluation of options.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

Many individuals rely on their clinical intuition, which is often mistaken for improvement over time, although without feedback, actual progress may not occur. They may also employ statistical intuition, meaning they base broad decisions on general data. For instance, students receiving vague grades without specific feedback struggle to understand their mistakes and may continue to depend on clinical intuition. To encourage student engagement, incorporating quizzes, assignments, and making the material more enjoyable can be effective.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement with the question by discussing the limitations of clinical intuition without feedback, connecting this to the educational context by explaining how vague grades hinder student learning, and proposing concrete solutions (quizzes, assignments, making material enjoyable) that address the constraint of limited time and resources while promoting active engagement.
