## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

In this model, System 1 plays a larger role because individuals form moral judgments instinctively and emotionally. In contrast, a rationalist perspective involves careful consideration of consequences before making moral decisions, which aligns with System 2. Since judgments in this model are primarily intuitive, System 1 is emphasized.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 involves instinctive and emotional judgments, which aligns with the answer key's requirement that System 1 refers to intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student correctly describes System 2 as involving 'careful consideration of consequences' and 'rationalist perspective,' which corresponds to the answer key's requirement that System 2 refers to reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student clearly states that 'System 1 plays a larger role' and 'System 1 is emphasized,' correctly identifying that System 1 thinking is more dominant according to Haidt's model.

Score: 1.0

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

Using the representativeness heuristic, we view the friend as a typical example of a model and thus assume he is one, without considering the overall proportion of models in the population.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive bias in this scenario.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of the heuristic by explaining that it involves judging someone as a typical example of a category (model) based on resemblance, and correctly notes the failure to consider base rates (proportion of models in population).

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

An anchor is an initial belief we hold about a subject or individual, which we use as a reference point when making predictions or judgments. The primacy effect refers to our tendency to recall information presented first more accurately than what comes afterward. This effect can act as an anchor, such as a first impression, which may explain why we tend to remember that information more clearly.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as using an initial belief/reference point for judgments and predictions, which aligns with the answer key's description of taking first information as a starting point.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as the tendency to recall information presented first more accurately, which matches the answer key's point about better remembering first information.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the connection by stating that primacy effect can act as an anchor and explains why first impressions are remembered more clearly, demonstrating understanding of their shared overreliance on first information.

Score: 1.0

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

In risk aversion, we favor certainty instead of uncertainty. In loss aversion, we try to avoid losses because we perceive a loss as more harmful than an equivalent gain is beneficial.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly explains that loss aversion involves perceiving losses as more harmful than equivalent gains are beneficial, which accurately captures the concept of weighing losses more heavily than gains.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that risk aversion involves favoring certainty over uncertainty, which matches the answer key's definition of preferring certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 1.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

The impact bias refers to our tendency to exaggerate how strong and long-lasting the effects of a decision will be when predicting our future emotions. In this situation, we avoid breaking up because we overestimate the emotional harm the breakup would cause us.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as the tendency to exaggerate/overestimate the effects of future events on emotions, which matches the answer key's definition.
- Correct: The student correctly explains that impact bias prevents breakups because people overestimate the emotional harm/negative feelings a breakup would cause, which aligns with the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting refers to our ability to anticipate how future events will impact our emotions. However, we often struggle to accurately estimate how strong and how long these feelings will last. In decisions made at the end of life, such as creating a living will, healthy individuals might make choices they later regret when they become ill, due to their inaccurate predictions of their future emotional states.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines affective forecasting as predicting future emotional states, though they add extra detail about duration and intensity that goes beyond the basic definition.
- Correct: The student accurately captures the key concept that healthy people may make end-of-life decisions they later regret when sick, demonstrating understanding of the disconnect between predicted and actual preferences.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

If the probability is extremely low, for example 0.01%, people tend to perceive it as impossible to occur according to prospect theory, leading to an underestimation. With slightly higher low probabilities, such as a 10% chance, people still underestimate them but recognize them as a possible outcome.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that people underestimate merely low probabilities like 10%, when prospect theory actually shows people tend to overestimate such probabilities.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that extremely low probabilities like 0.01% are perceived as impossible to occur according to prospect theory.

Score: 0.5

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

A loss is perceived as having a greater negative impact than an equivalent gain, meaning we subjectively view losses as more significant than they objectively are, which leads us to try to avoid them.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that losses have a greater impact than equivalent gains and are perceived as more significant, which captures the core concept that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities in prospect theory's value function.

Score: 1.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory uses numerical values to make objective decisions by selecting the option with the highest expected value. When applied to utilities, it assigns values to options and chooses the one with the greatest expected utility, additionally considering risk aversion.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student does not distinguish between financial and non-financial values. They describe both theories as using numerical values but miss that expected value theory specifically deals with financial values while expected utility theory encompasses broader non-financial values.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected utility theory considers risk aversion, which is a key difference from expected value theory that does not account for such heuristics and biases.

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected value theory assumes that individuals act rationally and select the option with the highest expected value. Expected utility theory suggests that people choose the option offering the greatest utility, incorporating risk aversion. The behavioral life cycle model is a descriptive framework explaining how people allocate their resources, highlighting that they sometimes violate the principle of fungibility. Prospect theory, an extension of expected utility theory, considers heuristics and biases, recognizing that people perceive gains and losses differently.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as involving rational selection of the highest expected value option, which aligns with the normative model concept from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes expected utility theory as choosing options with greatest utility and mentions risk aversion, which corresponds to the subjective utility aspect in the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student describes the behavioral life cycle model instead of multi-attribute utility theory. This is a completely different model that doesn't match the answer key's description of multiple attributes with utilities and weights.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies prospect theory as considering heuristics and biases, and mentions differential perception of gains and losses, which aligns with the descriptive behavioral model from the answer key.

Score: 0.75

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

When individuals believe they stand to lose something, they tend to take more risks.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion leads people to take more risks when facing potential losses, which aligns with the key point that loss aversion can decrease risk aversion and make people risk-seeking.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning is a learning process where we link two stimuli together. Classical conditioning involves learning that one stimulus predicts another (when A occurs, B follows), while operant conditioning connects two stimuli through the use of rewards or punishments.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as a learning process involving associations/links between stimuli, which aligns with learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as learning that one stimulus predicts another, which captures the essence of associating things that happen together in time and space.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly describes operant conditioning as connecting 'two stimuli' through rewards/punishments, when it should be about learning that actions (behaviors) cause rewards or punishments.

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

In illusory causation, individuals believe there is a cause-and-effect link between two stimuli simply because they occur together, even when no actual causal connection exists. Illusory correlation refers to the mistaken perception that two unrelated events are associated, such as noticing patterns or connections in random data.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly distinguishes both concepts: illusory causation as incorrectly inferring causation from correlation/co-occurrence, and illusory correlation as perceiving associations between unrelated/uncorrelated variables. The explanations align well with the answer key definitions.

Score: 1.0

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

A healthcare system is a schema because it represents general knowledge we have about a subject. A birthday party is a very familiar real-life event, making it a script.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the healthcare system as a schema and provides an accurate explanation that it represents general knowledge about a subject, which aligns with schemas being knowledge structures about relationships between things.
- Incorrect: While the student correctly identifies birthday party behavior as a script, their explanation is incomplete. They mention it's a 'familiar real-life event' but fail to explain that scripts are behavioral sequences for specific situations, missing the key concept of procedural knowledge for social behavior.

Score: 0.5

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

Mechanical (physical) perspective: behaviorists interpret behavior objectively as a response to stimuli.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that behaviorists adopted the physical (mechanical) stance and provides an accurate justification - they viewed behavior objectively as responses to stimuli, which aligns with the physical stance's focus on causal processes between stimulus and behavior.

Score: 1.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

The design stance interprets behavior by highlighting how it benefits humans, rather than relying on intuitive or intentional explanations.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the design stance and demonstrates understanding that it focuses on functional benefits rather than intentional explanations, which aligns with evolutionary psychology's approach of analyzing psychological processes in terms of their adaptive function.

Score: 1.0

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Cause and effect share similarities: A and B should be related or belong to the same category, such as covariates. They should occur simultaneously in terms of time and be close in physical proximity. Additionally, if A causes B, this relationship should be clearly evident within the context of our causal framework.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student does not mention distinctness/specificity - the idea that B should follow A but not other events.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention consistency - that B should always follow A.
- Incorrect: The student vaguely mentions 'causal framework' but does not clearly address plausibility or common sense reasoning.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies contiguity in time and space, mentioning simultaneous occurrence and physical proximity.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies similarity in cause and effect, stating that A and B should be related or belong to the same category.

Score: 0.4

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Negativity bias and availability bias are at play. People tend to pay more attention to negative information (such as headlines) than to neutral or positive content, which can make instances of moral outrage more easily recalled and lead to an exaggerated perception of their frequency.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias and explains it as the tendency to pay more attention to negative information, which aligns with the answer key's description of seeking out or placing more weight on negative information.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies availability bias (availability heuristic) and demonstrates understanding that easily recalled instances lead to overestimation of frequency, which matches the answer key's definition.
- Correct: The student successfully connects how negativity bias makes moral outrage more easily recalled, which then leads to exaggerated perception of frequency through availability bias, capturing the causal relationship described in the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

That you apply a particular schema (understanding or knowledge about something or someone) incorrectly to a different context, such as to a person.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions applying a schema incorrectly to a different context, but fails to specifically identify that biological contagion concepts are being misapplied to the social/psychological/cultural domain, which is the key insight required by the answer key.

Score: 0.0

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

If a conspiracy theory is widely accepted within a culture, then cultural influences contribute to the formation of delusional beliefs.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's answer discusses cultural influences on belief formation but does not address the key distinction between delusional and non-delusional conspiracy theories, which requires both irrationality and lack of common acceptance.

Score: 0.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

Narcissism involves a lack of understanding of the world, perceiving connections in unrelated patterns, and looking for simple answers to complicated issues.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies narcissism as one of the cognitive/personality factors contributing to conspiratorial thinking.
- Correct: The student mentions 'perceiving connections in unrelated patterns' which corresponds to 'seeing patterns in randomness' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student mentions 'looking for simple answers to complicated issues' which matches 'believing in simple explanations for complex events' from the answer key.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

In source amnesia, we may recall the incorrect information we recorded but forget where it came from and that it was inaccurate.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies source amnesia as the mechanism and accurately explains that you may recall the incorrect information while forgetting its source and inaccuracy, which matches the answer key's explanation of mistaking incorrect answers for correct ones due to forgetting they were initially wrong.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

The mere exposure effect refers to the tendency for people to develop a preference for things simply because they encounter them repeatedly.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the mere exposure effect and accurately describes it as the tendency to develop preferences for things encountered repeatedly, which directly answers the question about the psychological mechanism politicians use when repeating statements.

Score: 1.0

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

No, it actually improves their accuracy because individuals without depressive disorders tend to have a positivity bias, causing them to underestimate the chances of negative events occurring. In contrast, people with depression are more likely to believe that bad things are more probable to happen to them.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people with major depressive disorder are more accurate at predictions and explains this through the mechanism of reduced optimism bias in non-depressed individuals, which aligns with the answer key's point about reduced overly optimistic tendencies.

Score: 1.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

It moves a bit closer to the evidence, but the level of certainty (the graph's peak) remains unchanged.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that prior beliefs move closer to evidence when sensory reliability decreases. The correct answer is that prior beliefs have MORE influence on perception when sensory information is unreliable, not that they move toward the evidence.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

Pre-conventional level: individuals base their moral choices on the prospect of rewards or avoidance of punishment. Conventional level: individuals consider social norms and rules when making moral decisions to uphold the well-being of society. Post-conventional level: individuals develop a more profound and universal comprehension of morality. Each level is divided into two stages.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the pre-conventional level as focusing on rewards and punishment avoidance, which matches the answer key requirement of 'obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.'
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as considering social norms and rules for society's well-being, which aligns with the answer key's focus on 'social norms and other people's feelings.'
- Correct: The student describes the post-conventional level as developing 'universal comprehension of morality,' which corresponds to the answer key's focus on 'abstract principles and values.'

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

In the causal model, we aim to identify a variable that led to the outcome. This helps to partially explain hindsight bias because when people are aware of the result, they look for possible causes, which leads them to believe the outcome was unavoidable. They are making a causal attribution.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes identifying a variable that led to an outcome, but doesn't capture that a causal model is a coherent narrative of how past events are related to each other.
- Correct: The student correctly explains that awareness of results leads people to look for causes, making the outcome seem unavoidable, which accurately describes how causal models contribute to hindsight bias.

Score: 0.5

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

When making judgments about our previous likelihood estimates, we inevitably consider new information we've learned. As a result, we might believe our prediction was more accurate than it actually was.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when making judgments about past likelihood estimates, newly learned information is inevitably incorporated, which is the core mechanism of hindsight bias described in the answer key. The student also accurately explains the consequence - believing predictions were more accurate than they actually were.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizers aim to select the best possible option, while satisficers opt for a choice that meets their criteria. Individuals with high levels of neuroticism tend to adopt a maximizing decision style. Maximizing is associated with feelings of regret and higher neuroticism scores.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as aiming to select the best possible option, which aligns with 'trying to make the best choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as opting for a choice that meets their criteria, which corresponds to 'making a good-enough choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that individuals with high neuroticism tend to adopt a maximizing decision style, matching the answer key requirement.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

I would utilize peer feedback or AI tools to provide feedback, as we learned that feedback is crucial for enhancing intuition and knowledge. Additionally, nudges could be employed, such as a default nudge that automatically enrolls all students in a voluntary extra assignment. By making it the default option, many students may choose not to opt out and thus participate in the additional work willingly.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement by proposing specific, practical solutions (peer feedback, AI tools, default nudges for assignments) and connects these to course concepts like the importance of feedback for learning and nudging strategies. The answer shows thoughtful consideration of the constraint of limited time/resources while addressing student engagement.
