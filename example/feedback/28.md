Grade: 9.0

## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

In the social intuitionist model, moral judgments are primarily influenced by System 1 thinking through intuitive responses. System 2 thinking comes into play afterward, providing reasoning that serves as a retrospective justification for the moral judgment. The model emphasizes that System 1 thinking is the predominant force in this process.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 thinking involves intuitive responses, which aligns with the answer key's requirement that System 1 refers to intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student correctly describes System 2 thinking as providing reasoning and retrospective justification, which corresponds to the answer key's requirement that System 2 refers to reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student explicitly states that 'System 1 thinking is the predominant force in this process,' which directly satisfies the answer key's requirement that System 1 is more dominant than System 2.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

This assumption is based on the representative heuristic, which means people estimate the likelihood that something belongs to a category by how much it resembles other items in that category.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive bias in this scenario.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that the representativeness heuristic involves estimating likelihood of category membership based on resemblance to other items/stereotypes in that category, which matches the key concept from the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

-Anchoring: the first impressions or information received about a person serve as a reference point that influences how all subsequent information about that person is interpreted. -Primacy effect: the early information gathered about someone has a significantly greater impact on the overall impression formed of that individual. - Both concepts share the idea that initial impressions heavily shape the formation of opinions about a person.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as using first information as a reference point for interpreting subsequent information, which aligns with the answer key's definition of taking first information as a starting point.
- Incorrect: The student describes primacy effect as early information having greater impact on impression formation, but misses the key aspect from the answer key about better remembering the first piece of information.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both concepts involve initial impressions heavily shaping opinions, which corresponds to the answer key's point about overreliance on first information.

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

-Loss aversion: individuals tend to value losses more intensely than equivalent gains, leading them to steer clear of scenarios involving similar amounts of potential loss and gain. -Risk aversion: individuals favor certainty over unpredictability, causing them to shy away from unfamiliar situations or those that evoke feelings of fear or anxiety.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves valuing losses more intensely than equivalent gains and describes the tendency to avoid scenarios with potential losses, which aligns with the answer key's definition.
- Incorrect: While the student correctly states that risk aversion involves favoring certainty over unpredictability, they incorrectly extend this to include avoidance of unfamiliar situations or those causing fear/anxiety, which conflates risk aversion with other psychological concepts and goes beyond the core definition.

Score: 0.5

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Individuals tend to exaggerate how much future events will influence their feelings, a phenomenon called impact bias. This bias can cause people to stay in unhappy relationships because they overpredict the emotional pain of breaking up and overlook other influences that might improve their mood (Focalism). They also often overestimate the duration of strong emotions, assuming these feelings will last longer than they actually do (Emotional evanescence).

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as the tendency to exaggerate how much future events will influence feelings, which matches the answer key's definition of overestimating the impact of future events on future feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly explains that impact bias prevents breakups because people overpredict the emotional pain of breaking up, which aligns with the answer key's point about overestimating how bad a breakup will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting refers to predicting how one will feel emotionally as a result of a future event. It is crucial to take this into account in end-of-life decisions because of the disability paradox, which highlights that healthy individuals often believe they would prefer death over severe illness or disability, yet when faced with such circumstances, their feelings usually change.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines affective forecasting as predicting future emotional states, which aligns with the answer key's definition of 'predictions about our own future emotional state.'
- Correct: The student accurately explains the importance by referencing the disability paradox, which directly corresponds to the answer key's point that healthy people may predict preferring death when sick, but may not actually prefer to die when they become sick.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

Prospect theory suggests that individuals tend to overvalue low probabilities. However, there is a distinction between simply low probabilities (such as 10%) and extremely low probabilities (like 0.01%); people give too much weight to just low probabilities but generally regard extremely low probabilities as if they were impossible.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that merely low probabilities (like 10%) are overestimated or given too much weight according to prospect theory.
- Correct: The student accurately states that extremely low probabilities (like 0.01%) are treated as if they were impossible, which aligns with the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion represents a dislike or negative reaction to losses.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The answer describes loss aversion as a general dislike of losses, but does not capture the key aspect that loss aversion in prospect theory specifically means that negative utilities (losses) are weighted more heavily than positive utilities (gains) of the same magnitude, or that the value function is steeper for losses than gains.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

In expected value theory, outcomes are strictly monetary, whereas in expected utility theory, outcomes can be non-financial. Additionally, expected utility theory allows for subjective outcomes, unlike expected value theory.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory deals with monetary/financial outcomes while expected utility theory can handle non-financial outcomes, which matches the first point in the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student mentions 'subjective outcomes' but fails to address the key distinction about risk aversion and heuristics/biases that differentiate how the two theories handle decision-making under uncertainty.

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

-Expected Value Theory: A prescriptive decision-making model suggesting that the best choice is the one that maximizes value over time. -Expected Utility Theory: Like expected value theory, but assumes that outcomes have utilities which may be subjective and not necessarily monetary. -Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT): A prescriptive decision model where each option is evaluated based on multiple weighted attributes, similar to expected utility theory. -Prospect Theory: A descriptive decision-making model resembling expected utility theory but also includes the effects of heuristics and biases.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as a prescriptive/normative model and mentions maximizing value, though they say 'over time' rather than focusing on probabilistic outcomes with financial values.
- Correct: The student accurately describes expected utility theory as similar to expected value theory but with subjective utilities that aren't necessarily monetary, matching the key points.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies MAUT as a prescriptive model involving multiple weighted attributes, capturing the essential elements of the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes prospect theory as a descriptive model similar to expected utility theory but incorporating heuristics and biases, matching the answer key perfectly.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

When a scenario is presented as a loss, individuals are more likely to take risks instead of avoiding them.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion leads people to take risks when facing potential losses, which demonstrates understanding that loss aversion can override typical risk aversion and make people risk-seeking in loss domains.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves learning connections through the occurrence of events together. Classical conditioning is the process of learning to link events that occur simultaneously or in close proximity. Operant conditioning involves learning the relationship between a behavior and its consequences, such as rewards or punishments.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as learning connections/associations through events occurring together, which matches the key concept of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as learning to link events that occur simultaneously or in close proximity, which aligns with the answer key's description of associating things that happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning the relationship between behavior and consequences (rewards or punishments), which matches the answer key's definition of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

-In illusory correlation, individuals perceive relationships that aren't actually present. -In illusory causation, people interpret genuine correlations as causal connections even though no cause-and-effect relationship exists.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly distinguishes between illusory correlation (perceiving relationships that don't exist) and illusory causation (misinterpreting real correlations as causal relationships). This demonstrates understanding of the fundamental difference between the two concepts.

Score: 1.0

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

Knowing how the healthcare system functions is an example of a schema, as it offers the background needed to understand and respond suitably to a given situation. In contrast, acting 'appropriately' at a birthday party represents a script, since scripts are social schemas related to familiar events.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the healthcare system as a schema and provides a reasonable explanation that it provides background knowledge needed to understand and respond to situations, which aligns with schemas being knowledge structures about relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies birthday party behavior as a script and accurately explains that scripts are social schemas related to familiar events, which matches the answer key's explanation that scripts describe how to behave in specific situations.

Score: 1.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

Behaviourists took a mechanical approach, which means explaining something solely through its physical aspects.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that behaviorists adopted a physical/mechanical stance by focusing on explaining behavior through physical processes rather than mental states, which aligns with the answer key's point about adopting the physical stance due to focusing on stimulus-behavior processes.

Score: 1.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

Evolutionary psychologists take the design (or functional) approach, as it aids in understanding why something exists based on its structure and purpose, and it has certainly assisted them in viewing psychological processes through the lens of their evolutionary advantages.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance and provides an accurate explanation that they view psychological processes in terms of their function and evolutionary advantages, which aligns with the answer key's emphasis on considering processes in terms of their function.

Score: 1.0

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

These heuristics are causal rules, which include: Specificity—A causes B if B occurs only after A and not due to any other factor; Consistency—A causes B if B invariably happens after A; Plausibility—A causes B if it makes sense that A can lead to B; Contiguity in space and time—A causes B if B follows A and both happen in the same location; Similarity in cause and effect—A causes B if A and B share a noticeable resemblance.

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies specificity/distinctness and explains that B occurs only after A and not due to other factors, which matches the answer key's explanation.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies consistency and explains that B invariably happens after A, which aligns with the answer key's requirement that B always follows A.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies plausibility and explains it makes sense that A can lead to B, which matches the answer key's common sense criterion.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies contiguity in space and time, explaining that B follows A and both happen in the same location, which matches the answer key's temporal and spatial proximity requirement.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies similarity in cause and effect, explaining that A and B share a noticeable resemblance, which aligns with the answer key's superficial resemblance criterion.

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

- Availability bias: We assume that if an example is easy to recall, the likelihood of that event happening is higher. - Negativity bias: Individuals are inclined to focus on emotionally negative information. - These two biases combine to create an exaggerated perception, as the tendency to look for morally upsetting content (negativity bias) makes such content more prominent in our memory (availability bias), leading us to view the world as more negative than it truly is.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias and explains it as the tendency to focus on negative information, which aligns with the answer key's description of seeking out or placing more weight on negative content.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies availability bias (heuristic) and accurately explains it as assuming higher likelihood when examples are easy to recall, which matches the answer key's definition of estimating frequency based on ease of recall.
- Correct: The student successfully explains how these biases combine - negativity bias makes morally upsetting content more prominent in memory, which through availability bias leads to overestimating moral outrage, demonstrating understanding of their interaction.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

This example illustrates a superstition, which is an illogical belief that contradicts widely recognized natural laws. Such beliefs often arise when information from one area is mistakenly transferred to a different area.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that this involves mistaken transfer of information from one domain to another, which captures the key concept that biological contagion is being incorrectly applied to social/psychological situations.

Score: 1.0

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

If they are supported by scientific proof.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's answer focuses only on scientific proof as the distinguishing factor, but completely misses the key criteria from the answer key: that delusional conspiracy theories are both irrational beliefs AND not commonly accepted, while non-delusional ones don't meet both criteria.

Score: 0.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

-Narcissism - Accepting overly simplistic reasons for complicated situations - Identifying as male

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identified narcissism as a personality factor contributing to conspiratorial thinking, which directly matches the answer key.
- Correct: The student's mention of 'accepting overly simplistic reasons for complicated situations' accurately captures the concept of 'believing in simple explanations for complex events' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identified 'identifying as male' which corresponds to 'being a man' as listed in the answer key as a demographic factor associated with conspiratorial thinking.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Incorrect responses can disrupt the development of clinical intuition, which involves making predictions grounded in experience and knowledge. Failing to encounter the correct answer impedes learning by withholding proper feedback and creates a false impression that our responses are accurate, due to cognitive fluency.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student discusses cognitive fluency and clinical intuition but does not identify the specific psychological mechanism from the answer key. The response misses source amnesia (forgetting that an incorrect answer was wrong), proactive interference (initial incorrect answers interfering with correct ones), or the continued-influence effect. The student focuses on lack of feedback rather than how incorrect answers can be misremembered as correct.

Score: 0.0

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

They might be relying on the psychological principle of mere exposure, where people tend to prefer things they recognize, so repeatedly hearing these statements could reinforce their beliefs and make the message more appealing.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies mere exposure as the psychological mechanism and accurately explains that it involves preferring things we are familiar with or recognize. The explanation that repeated exposure makes messages more appealing directly addresses the question.

Score: 1.0

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Yes, individuals with major depressive disorder tend to be less precise when making these predictions. Those affected by major depressive disorder are less prone to displaying a positivity bias, which is the tendency to underestimate the chances of negative events occurring to themselves.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly identifies that people with major depressive disorder show reduced positivity bias, but incorrectly states they are 'less precise' when the answer key indicates they are actually 'more accurate' at making predictions due to this reduced optimism bias.

Score: 0.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

When sensory information becomes less reliable, prior beliefs take precedence.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that prior beliefs become more influential when sensory information is less reliable, which directly matches the key concept from the answer key.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

The three stages include: the pre-conventional stage, where moral decisions are driven by the desire to gain rewards and avoid punishment; the conventional stage, where moral choices are guided by social norms and the consideration of others' feelings; and the post-conventional stage, where moral reasoning is based on universal ethical principles and recognizes that moral perspectives can sometimes be in conflict.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the pre-conventional level as being driven by desire to gain rewards and avoid punishment, which matches the answer key's focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as being guided by social norms and consideration of others' feelings, which directly aligns with the answer key's description.
- Correct: The student correctly describes the post-conventional level as being based on universal ethical principles, which matches the answer key's focus on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

Causal model: Individuals create a logical explanation of not only what occurred but also what might have happened, which leads to hindsight bias because they consider the actual outcome when evaluating the probability of decisions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a causal model involves creating a logical explanation of what occurred, which aligns with the concept of a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student accurately explains how causal models contribute to hindsight bias by noting that people consider the actual outcome when evaluating probability, which makes events seem more inevitable than they were.

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

People struggle to assess the probability of past events accurately without considering information they have acquired since then.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people cannot avoid incorporating newly learned information when estimating past probabilities, which is the core mechanism of how learning contributes to hindsight bias.

Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

-Maximizing involves trying to choose the very best option available. -Satisficing involves settling for an option that is satisfactory or adequate. - Individuals with a high level of neuroticism tend to be more inclined toward a maximizing approach to decision-making.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as trying to choose the very best option available, which aligns with the answer key's definition of trying to make the best choice.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as settling for an option that is satisfactory or adequate, which matches the answer key's definition of making a good-enough choice.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that individuals high in neuroticism tend toward maximizing decision-making, which directly matches the answer key's requirement.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

I would leverage AI to handle routine activities such as grading and providing feedback, allowing me to dedicate more time to enhancing lecture preparation by creating more engaging slides and designing assignments that are thought-provoking and interesting, ultimately boosting student engagement with the content.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student provides a thoughtful response that demonstrates serious engagement with the question. They identify a specific strategy (leveraging AI for routine tasks) and explain how this would free up time for more meaningful pedagogical activities like creating engaging content and assignments. This shows understanding of the time/resource constraints mentioned in the question and offers a practical solution to enhance student engagement.
