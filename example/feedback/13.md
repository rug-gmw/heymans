## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

System 1 operates in moral reasoning by enabling quick and instinctive decisions or judgments. In contrast, System 2 comes into play during more complicated moral reasoning that demands deliberate and thoughtful consideration. This model suggests that System 1 is generally the more prevalent mode in moral reasoning.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 involves quick and instinctive decisions/judgments, which aligns with the answer key's requirement to identify System 1 as intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student accurately describes System 2 as involving deliberate and thoughtful consideration, which matches the answer key's requirement to identify System 2 as reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student clearly states that System 1 is 'generally the more prevalent mode in moral reasoning,' which correctly identifies System 1 as more dominant than System 2.

Score: 1.0

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

Representativeness heuristic. This decision will rely on how much the colleague resembles a fashion model.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process in this scenario.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that the heuristic involves judging likelihood based on resemblance to a stereotype, though the explanation is brief it captures the essential mechanism.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

The primacy effect occurs when the initial information or characteristics people receive about someone or something heavily influence their overall impression. Anchoring happens when this initial impression acts as a baseline for interpreting new information. Both concepts share the idea that the first impression has the most significant impact on people's evaluations.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes anchoring as initial impression acting as a baseline, but the answer key defines it as taking the first piece of information as the starting point. The student's definition is too narrow and context-specific to impressions rather than general information processing.
- Incorrect: The student describes primacy effect as initial information influencing overall impression, but the answer key defines it as the tendency to better remember the first piece of information. The student confuses primacy effect with impression formation rather than memory recall.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both concepts involve the first information having the most significant impact, which aligns with the answer key's point about overreliance on the first piece of information.

Score: 0.3333333333333333

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency to strongly prefer avoiding losses over acquiring equivalent gains. Risk aversion involves a preference for certainty and avoiding risky choices. Nevertheless, when faced with uncertainty, individuals are more likely to take risks.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines loss aversion as the tendency to strongly prefer avoiding losses over acquiring equivalent gains, which matches the answer key's definition.
- Incorrect: While the student correctly identifies that risk aversion involves preference for certainty, the additional statement that 'individuals are more likely to take risks when faced with uncertainty' contradicts the definition of risk aversion and creates confusion.

Score: 0.5

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias occurs when individuals exaggerate the effect an event or situation will have on their emotions. This bias can stop people from ending a relationship because they might think that doing so, even if they are unhappy, will lead to feelings of loneliness, stress, and anxiety.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as exaggerating the effect an event will have on emotions, which aligns with overestimating the impact of future events on future feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly explains that impact bias prevents breakups by making people think ending the relationship will cause negative feelings like loneliness, stress, and anxiety, which demonstrates understanding that they overestimate how bad the breakup will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves predicting how a choice will impact your future emotions. It plays a crucial role in end-of-life decisions because our anticipated feelings often differ from how we truly experience them later. People typically exaggerate the intensity of their future emotions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies affective forecasting as predictions about future emotional states, which aligns with the answer key's definition of 'predictions about our own future emotional state.'
- Correct: The student captures the key insight that anticipated feelings differ from actual experience, which corresponds to the answer key's point about healthy people predicting they'd prefer to die when sick but potentially not preferring death when actually ill.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

People tend to overestimate the likelihood of unlikely events, although this varies between events that are just unlikely and those that are extremely unlikely, which people assume will never occur.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people overestimate unlikely events, which aligns with the answer key point about overestimating merely low probabilities.
- Correct: The student correctly distinguishes that extremely unlikely events are assumed to 'never occur,' which matches the answer key point about extremely low probabilities being interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

In prospect theory, loss aversion represents a disutility.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The answer is too vague and doesn't capture the key aspect of loss aversion. While losses do create disutility, loss aversion specifically refers to the asymmetry where losses are weighted more heavily than equivalent gains, or that the value function is steeper in the loss domain than the gain domain.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected utility theory takes into account heuristics and biases, whereas expected value theory centers solely on economic aspects, with expected utility theory also considering non-economic elements.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory focuses on economic/financial aspects while expected utility theory considers non-economic elements, which matches the first point in the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that expected utility theory takes into account heuristics and biases. The answer key specifies that expected utility theory considers risk aversion, not heuristics and biases, which are typically associated with behavioral economics rather than classical expected utility theory.

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Model of anticipated utility Model of anticipated value

Feedback:

- Incorrect: Student only mentions 'Model of anticipated utility' and 'Model of anticipated value' but fails to identify Expected Value Theory or provide any explanation of it.
- Incorrect: While 'Model of anticipated utility' could relate to Expected Utility Theory, the student provides no explanation of the concept and doesn't clearly identify it as Expected Utility Theory.
- Incorrect: Student does not mention Multi-attribute Utility Theory at all and provides no explanation of this model.
- Incorrect: Student does not mention Prospect Theory at all and provides no explanation of this descriptive model.

Score: 0.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Individuals are more motivated to prevent losses than to achieve gains.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly defines loss aversion but fails to address the key question about how this affects risk aversion. The answer does not explain that loss aversion can make people risk-seeking when trying to avoid losses, which is the core relationship the question asks about.

Score: 0.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Classical conditioning involves forming a link between a stimulus and a response due to their close occurrence in time and place. Operant conditioning involves establishing a connection between a stimulus and a response through the use of rewards or punishments.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student does not define conditioning as learning associations through covariation, but jumps directly to describing the two types.
- Correct: The student correctly describes classical conditioning as forming links between stimuli and responses due to their close occurrence in time and place, which aligns with learning associations when things happen together.
- Correct: The student correctly describes operant conditioning as establishing connections through rewards or punishments, which matches the key point about learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

The Dutch healthcare system operates according to a structure, while the expected conduct at a birthday party follows a set pattern.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student identifies that the healthcare system has a structure but fails to explicitly identify it as a schema or explain that schemas represent knowledge and relationships between concepts.
- Incorrect: The student recognizes that birthday party behavior follows a pattern but doesn't identify it as a script or explain that scripts are social schemas describing behavioral sequences in specific situations.

Score: 0.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

Behaviorists took a mechanical approach, concentrating solely on observable behavior because they believed it was the only aspect that could be measured, while the mind was considered unmeasurable.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly identifies that behaviorists focused on observable behavior and avoided studying the unmeasurable mind, but they do not identify this as the 'physical stance' from Dennett's framework, nor do they explain that behaviorists focused on the causal processes linking stimuli to behaviors.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

Evolutionary psychologists take a design-oriented approach, emphasizing the function of psychological processes. They do this because it provides the most effective explanation for the usefulness of these processes from an evolutionary perspective.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance and provides an accurate explanation that they focus on the function of psychological processes, which aligns with the answer key's emphasis on considering processes in terms of their function.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

The representativeness heuristic involves judging whether something belongs to a group based on how typical it seems of that group. The availability heuristic, on the other hand, relies on how easily examples or associations come to mind when making judgments. Social media uses algorithms that prioritize content similar to what you have previously interacted with for longer or more frequently. Additionally, comment sections often display the most relevant comments according to these algorithms. As a result, angry videos and comments about a topic tend to be more prominent in your feed and more readily recalled since you have been exposed to more content from that viewpoint compared to opposing perspectives.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student does not identify or explain the negativity bias, which is a key component of the answer key. They mention angry content but do not connect it to the specific bias that makes us seek out or weight negative information more heavily.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies and explains the availability heuristic as relying on how easily examples come to mind when making judgments, which matches the answer key definition.
- Correct: The student successfully explains the mechanism by which these biases work together - social media algorithms make angry content more prominent and easily recalled, leading to overestimation of moral outrage. This captures the essential interaction described in the answer key, even though they use algorithm effects rather than negativity bias as the first component.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

Based on your framework, that object is considered theirs and is tainted by them.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student identifies that objects become 'tainted' but fails to explain this phenomenon in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge. The answer does not mention the key concept that biological contagion principles are being incorrectly applied to social/psychological domains.

Score: 0.0

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A non-delusional conspiracy theory is one that is based on actual facts.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student only addresses one aspect of non-delusional conspiracy theories (being fact-based) but misses the key distinction from the answer key that delusional conspiracy theories are characterized by being both irrational beliefs AND not commonly accepted. The student's answer doesn't capture the dual criteria or explain what makes a theory delusional versus non-delusional.

Score: 0.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

Inclinations toward paranoid personality traits. Analytical, deliberate thinking.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student mentions 'paranoid personality traits' which aligns with the answer key's reference to narcissistic personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking.
- Incorrect: The student mentions 'analytical, deliberate thinking' as contributing to conspiratorial thinking, but the answer key indicates that having a LOW level of analytical thinking contributes to conspiratorial thinking, making this incorrect.
- Incorrect: The student only provided two factors when the question asked for three factors from the lecture material.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Classical conditioning involves forming an incorrect association.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies classical conditioning as the mechanism. The correct answer involves source amnesia (forgetting that an incorrect answer was wrong) or proactive interference (where initial incorrect answers interfere with later correct ones). Classical conditioning involves associating stimuli with responses, which is not the psychological mechanism described in the question about forgetting the source of information or interference between competing memories.

Score: 0.0

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

Associative learning through classical conditioning.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student answer identifies classical conditioning, which is not the correct psychological mechanism. The answer key requires mere exposure effect or illusory-truth effect, both of which explain how repeated exposure increases preference or perceived truthfulness, whereas classical conditioning involves learning associations between stimuli and responses.

Score: 0.0

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Yes, due to the tendency to focus more on negative information.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that major depressive disorder makes people less accurate at predictions due to focusing on negative information. The correct answer is that people with major depressive disorder are MORE accurate because they show reduced optimism bias, not less accurate due to negativity focus.

Score: 0.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

As a result, your perception will be shaped more by your expectations alone rather than by both your expectations and the sensory information you receive.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when sensory information becomes less reliable, prior beliefs/expectations have increased influence on perception, which aligns with the key concept that perception shifts toward being more dominated by expectations rather than sensory input.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

In the pre-conventional stage, a child understands the need to avoid punishment. In the conventional stage, the child recognizes the importance of adhering to rules, laws, and respecting authority. In the post-conventional stage, individuals develop their own moral principles, which may differ from societal or governmental standards.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the pre-conventional level as focusing on avoiding punishment, which aligns with the answer key's description of obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as adhering to rules, laws, and respecting authority, which corresponds to the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the post-conventional level as developing one's own moral principles that may differ from societal standards, which matches the answer key's description of focusing on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

Score: 0.0

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

People discover the real result of an event and then believe they had predicted that specific outcome all along. This phenomenon is known as hindsight bias.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes what hindsight bias is but does not explain how learning contributes to it. The answer key requires explaining that newly learned information cannot be avoided when estimating past likelihood judgments, but the student does not address this mechanism.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing involves aiming to choose the absolute best option, while satisficing means selecting a decision that might not be perfect but is still acceptable. Individuals who score high in neuroticism are more likely to use a maximizing approach when making decisions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as aiming to choose the absolute best option, which aligns with 'trying to make the best choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as selecting a decision that is acceptable but not perfect, which matches the concept of 'making a good-enough choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that individuals high in neuroticism are more likely to use a maximizing approach, which directly matches the answer key's expectation.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

The course "psychologische gespreksvoering" faced a similar issue and addressed it by using student assistants to lead personalized "werkcolleges," during which we completed assignments and received detailed feedback on our progress and grades. I believe this approach could be effective for this course too. It could be integrated with the essay assignment by arranging meetings with a student assistant who has previously completed the course, providing personalized feedback and support for any questions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement with the question by providing a concrete, well-thought-out solution based on their own educational experience. They identify a specific approach (using student assistants for personalized feedback sessions) and explain how it could be adapted to address the constraint of limited time and resources while still providing meaningful engagement and feedback to students.
