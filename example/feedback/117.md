## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidtâ€™s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

The social-intuitionist model suggests that moral judgments are primarily influenced by intuition. Because system 1 centers on intuitive thinking, it plays the leading role in this model. In moral reasoning, there is a conflict between system 1 and system 2: system 1 operates through effortless, instinctive thought, while system 2 involves more effortful, deliberate, and logical processes. Nonetheless, moral reasoning occurs only in certain situations.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 centers on intuitive thinking, which aligns with the answer key's requirement that System 1 refers to intuitions.
- Correct: The student accurately describes System 2 as involving 'effortful, deliberate, and logical processes,' which corresponds to the answer key's definition of reasoning/rational thought.
- Correct: The student clearly states that System 1 'plays the leading role' in the social-intuitionist model, satisfying the requirement that System 1 is more dominant than System 2.

Score: 1.0

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

Representativeness heuristic refers to the way individuals assess the likelihood that something falls into a specific category by how closely it matches the typical characteristics of that category. Here, the colleague is categorized as a model because they closely match the common image or stereotype associated with models.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process in this scenario.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that the representativeness heuristic involves estimating likelihood of category membership based on resemblance to typical characteristics/stereotypes of that category, which matches the answer key's explanation.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring refers to the way initial information acts as a reference point when forming impressions. The primacy effect highlights how the first information encountered has a stronger influence on impression formation. Both concepts relate to impression formation and stress the significance of information presented at the beginning.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as using initial information as a reference point, which aligns with the answer key's description of taking the first piece of information as the starting point.
- Incorrect: The student describes the primacy effect as having stronger influence on impression formation rather than better memory/recall of first information, which is the key distinction in the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both concepts emphasize the significance of information presented at the beginning, which corresponds to overreliance on first information.

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency for individuals to give greater importance to losses than to gains. Risk aversion describes the general preference for certainty rather than uncertainty. When confronted with potential losses, people may become more willing to take risks, indicating that loss aversion affects risk aversion.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves giving greater importance to losses than to gains, which matches the answer key's definition of weighing losses more heavily than gains.
- Correct: The student accurately describes risk aversion as the general preference for certainty rather than uncertainty, which aligns with the answer key's definition of preferring certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 1.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias is the tendency for individuals to exaggerate how strongly future events will influence their emotions. For example, people often predict they will feel worse than they actually do after a breakup, leading them to avoid ending an unhappy relationship even though leaving it is likely to increase their overall happiness.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as the tendency to exaggerate how strongly future events will influence emotions, which matches the answer key's definition of overestimating the impact of future events on future feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly explains that impact bias prevents breakups because people predict they will feel worse than they actually do after a breakup, which aligns with the answer key's point about overestimating how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves predicting our future emotional states. Although these predictions strongly influence our choices, we tend to be inaccurate at it. For instance, we often exaggerate how bad we will feel after certain events, a phenomenon known as impact bias. Healthy individuals might predict extreme misery if they become ill, sometimes expressing a desire to end their life in conditions like advanced Alzheimer's. However, when people do become seriously ill, they may not feel as miserable as they anticipated, even if they are unable to express this later. This understanding is crucial when making decisions about end-of-life care.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines affective forecasting as predicting our future emotional states, which matches the answer key's definition of predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that healthy people may predict they will prefer to die when they get sick (using the Alzheimer's example), but when they actually become ill, they may not feel as miserable as anticipated, which aligns with the answer key's point about not actually preferring to die when sick.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

People tend to undervalue small probabilities. While moderately low probabilities are still seen as possible, extremely low probabilities are often considered impossible.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student states that people 'undervalue small probabilities' which contradicts the answer key that merely low probabilities are often overestimated according to prospect theory.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that extremely low probabilities are often considered impossible, which aligns with the answer key's point about them being interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 0.5

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Avoiding losses requires cognitive effort and results in a negative experience.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes cognitive effort and negative experience but does not address the key concept that loss aversion reflects asymmetric weighting where negative utilities (losses) are weighted more heavily than positive utilities (gains) of equal magnitude.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory applies solely to financial results, while expected utility theory incorporates non-financial outcomes as well. Moreover, expected utility theory accounts for risk aversion, which expected value theory does not.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory deals only with financial results while expected utility theory incorporates non-financial outcomes, which matches the first point in the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately states that expected utility theory accounts for risk aversion while expected value theory does not, which aligns with the second point in the answer key about expected utility theory considering risk aversion.

Score: 1.0

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesnâ€™t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected value theory is a prescriptive model for decision-making that assigns multiple financial outcomes to each option, each with an associated probability. It assumes flawless calculation of probabilities and ignores heuristics and biases. Expected utility theory is also a prescriptive model that disregards heuristics and biases but extends beyond financial outcomes and incorporates risk aversion. Multi-attribute utility theory resembles expected utility theory but focuses on options characterized by several attributes, each with its own utility and weighting; it remains a prescriptive model that does not account for heuristics and biases. Prospect theory, while related to expected utility theory, is a descriptive model that acknowledges heuristics and biases. It is based on three key ideas: people evaluate outcomes as gains or losses rather than absolute values, they exhibit consistent biases in assessing utility, and they systematically misinterpret probabilities.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as a prescriptive/normative model involving financial outcomes with probabilities, though they add extra detail about assumptions and biases not required by the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes expected utility theory as extending beyond financial outcomes to include subjective utility, and correctly notes it's a prescriptive/normative model like expected value theory.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies multi-attribute utility theory as involving multiple attributes with utilities and weights, and properly categorizes it as a prescriptive/normative model.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies prospect theory as a descriptive model that considers heuristics and biases, and accurately relates it to expected utility theory while noting the key behavioral differences.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease peopleâ€™s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Loss aversion describes the tendency for individuals to place greater importance on losses than on equivalent gains. Typically, people tend to avoid risk, favoring certainty over unpredictability. Yet, when confronted with possible losses, they might become more willing to take risks.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion can make people more willing to take risks when facing potential losses, which aligns with the key point that loss aversion decreases risk aversion and can make people risk-seeking in loss domains.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves learning connections based on the experience of events occurring together. In classical conditioning, these associations are formed by encountering events simultaneously in time and place, whereas operant conditioning centers on understanding that behaviors lead to certain consequences, such as rewards or punishments.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines conditioning as learning connections/associations based on events occurring together, which aligns with the answer key's definition of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as forming associations by encountering events simultaneously in time and place, which matches the answer key's explanation of learning to associate things that happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as understanding that behaviors lead to consequences like rewards or punishments, which directly corresponds to the answer key's definition of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory correlation involves perceiving relationships that aren't actually there, whereas illusory causation refers to interpreting a causal connection within a correlation.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that illusory correlation involves perceiving relationships that don't exist, and that illusory causation involves interpreting causal connections within correlations. This captures the key distinction between perceiving non-existent correlations versus misinterpreting existing correlations as causal.

Score: 1.0

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to â€˜properlyâ€™ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

A schema offers a framework for interpreting situations and aids our understanding of them. The Dutch healthcare system functions as a schema because it assists us in adapting to that society. A script is a type of social schema related to familiar scenarios. Therefore, the expected behavior at a birthday party is a script, as a birthday party is a typical situation.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the Dutch healthcare system as a schema and provides a reasonable explanation that it helps with understanding and adapting to society, which aligns with schemas being knowledge structures about relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies birthday party behavior as a script and accurately explains that scripts are social schemas for familiar situations, which matches the answer key's emphasis on scripts describing behavior in specific situations.

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

The physical (mechanical) perspective examines behavior by focusing on the physical attributes and traits of individuals. Behaviorists view behavior as a response triggered by physical stimuli, which is why they use the physical stance.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that behaviorists adopted the physical stance and provides appropriate reasoning that they focused on how physical stimuli trigger behavioral responses, which aligns with the answer key's emphasis on stimulus-behavior processes.

Score: 1.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

The functional or design perspective emphasizes understanding people's behavior by examining the purpose behind their actions. Evolutionary psychologists consider psychological processes in terms of their past adaptive value, evaluating how these processes served a function. Therefore, they take on the functional stance.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that evolutionary psychologists adopt the design/functional stance and provides accurate reasoning - they explain that evolutionary psychologists examine psychological processes in terms of their function and adaptive purpose, which aligns with the design stance's focus on understanding systems through their intended function.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

1. Uniqueness: B occurs only after A and not otherwise. 2. Reliability: B always follows A without exception. 3. Credibility: It is reasonable to believe that A causes B. 4. Temporal and spatial closeness: B happens immediately after A. 5. Resemblance in cause and outcome: A and B share a similar cause-and-effect relationship.

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies the concept of distinctness/specificity using the term 'uniqueness' and accurately explains that B occurs only after A and not otherwise.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies consistency using the term 'reliability' and accurately explains that B always follows A without exception.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies plausibility using the term 'credibility' and accurately explains that it must be reasonable to believe A causes B.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies contiguity in time and space using 'temporal and spatial closeness' and explains that B happens immediately after A, though the explanation focuses more on temporal than spatial aspects.
- Incorrect: Student misunderstands the similarity heuristic. They describe it as 'similar cause-and-effect relationship' rather than A and B superficially resembling each other in their characteristics.

Score: 0.8

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

The availability heuristic refers to the tendency of people to estimate the likelihood of an event based on how readily examples or associations come to mind. Negativity bias highlights how our choices are strongly shaped by emotions, particularly negative ones, and demonstrates our inclination to focus on negative emotional material. This drives us to often seek out content that evokes moral outrage, increasing our exposure to it. Combined with the availability heuristic, this results in an exaggerated perception of how many individuals are morally outraged.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines negativity bias as the inclination to focus on negative emotional material and explains how it drives us to seek out morally outraged content.
- Correct: The student accurately defines the availability heuristic as the tendency to estimate likelihood of events based on how readily examples come to mind.
- Correct: The student successfully explains the connection between the two biases, noting that negativity bias increases exposure to moral outrage content, which through availability heuristic leads to overestimating how many people are morally outraged.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

Framework theories are general, intuitive beliefs about how the world functions. When information from one area is used in another unrelated area, it can lead to superstitions. These are unfounded beliefs that contradict natural laws, with magical contagion serving as an example.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that framework theories from one domain (biological contagion) are being misapplied to another domain (social/psychological), which explains the magical thinking. The answer demonstrates understanding that this cross-domain application leads to unfounded beliefs that contradict natural laws.

Score: 1.0

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A delusional conspiracy theory is rejected by society, while a non-delusional conspiracy theory is generally accepted.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student only addresses the social acceptance aspect but misses the crucial element of irrationality. According to the answer key, a delusional conspiracy theory requires both irrational belief AND lack of common acceptance, not just social rejection alone.

Score: 0.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

Sense of disconnection or not fitting in. Looking for straightforward reasons behind complicated situations. Difficulty in comprehending the world.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions 'sense of disconnection or not fitting in' which is not listed among the cognitive and personality factors in the answer key.
- Correct: The student mentions 'looking for straightforward reasons behind complicated situations' which corresponds to 'believing in simple explanations for complex events' from the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student mentions 'difficulty in comprehending the world' which is vague and does not clearly match any specific factor from the answer key, though it might loosely relate to low intelligence or analytical thinking.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you donâ€™t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

The ongoing impact effect.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions 'ongoing impact effect' which is not a recognized psychological mechanism. The answer key accepts 'continued-influence effect' as an alternative term, but 'ongoing impact effect' is not the same concept and does not accurately describe how incorrect answers interfere with learning through source amnesia or proactive interference.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

Simply being exposed.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The answer is too vague and incomplete. While 'being exposed' hints at the mere exposure effect, it lacks the specific psychological terminology and fails to explain the mechanism by which repeated exposure leads to increased preference or familiarity.

Score: 0.0

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

People often underestimate the chances of negative events occurring to them. When confronted with statistical evidence, they frequently do not adjust their beliefs accordingly. In contrast, individuals with major depressive disorder lack this optimistic bias, resulting in more precise predictions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people with major depressive disorder are more accurate at making predictions about negative events because they lack the optimistic bias that non-depressed individuals exhibit, which aligns with the answer key's point about reduced overly optimistic tendencies leading to greater accuracy.

Score: 1.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

As the evidence diminishes, prior beliefs take precedence.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when sensory evidence becomes less reliable (diminishes), prior beliefs have greater influence on perception (take precedence), which directly matches the key concept from the answer key.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You donâ€™t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other peopleâ€™s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

The three stages are known as the pre-conventional, conventional, and post-conventional levels. At the pre-conventional stage, the emphasis is on self-interest and minimal consideration of others. The conventional stage centers on social relationships and understanding others' feelings. The post-conventional stage involves recognizing universal ethical principles and understanding that moral values can sometimes be in conflict.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the pre-conventional level and describes it as focusing on self-interest, which aligns with the answer key's description of avoiding punishment or gaining rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as centering on social relationships and understanding others' feelings, which matches the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the post-conventional level and describes it as involving universal ethical principles, which aligns with the answer key's description of focusing on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model represents the way individuals create a logical cause-and-effect story about an event after it occurs. As a result, the actual outcome is more readily recalled than alternative possibilities that did not occur. Consequently, when reflecting on the event, the actual outcome naturally comes to mind and is perceived as more likely, which in turn leads to hindsight bias.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a causal model is a logical cause-and-effect story/narrative about events, which aligns with the answer key's definition of a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student effectively explains how causal models contribute to hindsight bias by making the actual outcome seem more likely/inevitable in retrospect, which matches the answer key's point about events seeming more inevitable than they were.

Score: 1.0

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

When estimating how likely past events were, itâ€™s unavoidable to consider information youâ€™ve acquired afterward, known as the curse of knowledge. As a result, once youâ€™ve learned something, your assessment of probabilities changes, which leads to hindsight bias.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly explains that when estimating past likelihood judgments, newly learned information cannot be avoided, and accurately identifies this as the curse of knowledge. The answer demonstrates understanding of how this mechanism leads to hindsight bias.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing involves seeking the optimal choice, whereas satisficing means settling for an option that is sufficiently good. Neuroticism is linked to a maximizing approach to decision-making.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as seeking the optimal choice, which aligns with the answer key's description of trying to make the best choice.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as settling for an option that is sufficiently good, which matches the answer key's definition of making a good-enough choice.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that neuroticism is linked to a maximizing approach to decision-making, which matches the answer key's statement that high neuroticism leads to adopting the maximizing decision style.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

You could consider concluding each lecture with a few questions related to the content. This allows students to engage actively with the material and provides a useful way to evaluate their understanding. This approach can be implemented through online tools such as Polleverywhere or Mentimeter and requires minimal time.
