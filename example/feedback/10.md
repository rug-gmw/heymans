## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidtâ€™s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

System 1 and System 2 represent two different modes of thinking. System 1 involves rapid moral decisions rooted in personal beliefs, whereas System 2 involves deliberate reasoning that takes various moral perspectives into account. In the social intuitionist model, System 1 tends to play a more prominent role.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes System 1 as 'rapid moral decisions rooted in personal beliefs' rather than specifically identifying it as intuitions or emotions, which is the key concept in Haidt's model.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies System 2 as 'deliberate reasoning' which aligns with the answer key's description of reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student correctly states that 'System 1 tends to play a more prominent role,' which matches the answer key's requirement that System 1 is more dominant than System 2.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

This stems from representativeness bias, which involves assuming someone belongs to a group based on how closely they resemble the typical characteristics of that group.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic (referred to as 'representativeness bias') as the underlying cognitive process.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that this heuristic involves judging group membership based on similarity to typical characteristics of that group, which matches the answer key's explanation about estimating likelihood based on resemblance to stereotypes.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring plays a role in forming impressions. The primacy effect suggests that initial information is remembered more vividly. Together, they help create first impressions that act as a starting point to be modified over time.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that anchoring involves using initial information as a starting point, though they frame it specifically in the context of impression formation rather than more generally.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as initial information being remembered more vividly, which captures the essence of better remembering first information.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding that both concepts relate to overreliance on first information by explaining how they work together to create lasting first impressions that serve as starting points.

Score: 1.0

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion involves evaluating a situation by considering potential gains or losses. Risk aversion centers on assessing the danger of a risk, particularly how controllable it is and whether it presents a personal threat.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's definition of loss aversion is too vague and doesn't capture the key concept that losses are weighted more heavily than equivalent gains. The answer mentions considering gains/losses but misses the asymmetric weighting that defines loss aversion.
- Incorrect: The student's definition of risk aversion focuses on danger assessment and controllability rather than the preference for certainty over uncertainty. This conflates risk assessment with risk aversion and doesn't address the fundamental concept of preferring certain outcomes over uncertain ones.

Score: 0.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

- Incorrect: No answer provided

Score: 0.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting refers to predicting how you will feel emotionally or mentally in the future. This is significant because, when healthy, you might prefer death over becoming old and disabled, but upon actually experiencing that stage, your perspective may shift.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines affective forecasting as predicting future emotional or mental states, which aligns with the answer key's definition of predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Correct: The student accurately captures the core concept that healthy people may predict preferring death when sick/disabled, but their actual preferences may change when they experience that condition, which matches the answer key's explanation about the discrepancy between predicted and actual preferences.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

People often undervalue probabilities depending on their likelihood. For example, a 10% chance may be acknowledged, but extremely low chances are often seen as impossible.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student states people 'undervalue' 10% probabilities, but the answer key indicates that merely low probabilities are 'overestimated', which is the opposite direction.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that extremely low probabilities are 'seen as impossible', which aligns with the answer key's point about them being 'interpreted as impossibilities'.

Score: 0.5

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion describes the tendency for individuals to require taking a risk in order to achieve a higher potential gain, according to prospect theory.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's answer incorrectly describes loss aversion as requiring risk-taking for higher gains, which confuses it with risk-seeking behavior. The correct answer should explain that loss aversion means negative utilities (losses) are weighted more heavily than positive utilities (gains) of the same magnitude, or that the value function is steeper for losses than gains.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory relies more on actual statistical data and is primarily applicable to financial contexts, whereas expected utility theory is more subjective, allowing it to be used in a wider range of scenarios.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory is primarily applicable to financial contexts while expected utility theory can be used in a wider range of scenarios, which aligns with the answer key's distinction between financial and non-financial values.
- Incorrect: The student mentions subjectivity and statistical data but does not address the key distinction about risk aversion and heuristics/biases that differentiates expected utility theory from expected value theory.

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesnâ€™t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected Value: Selecting among different choices using full knowledge of the probabilities involved. Expected Utility: Making decisions among various options based on a personal assessment of their usefulness or value. Attribute-Utility: Choosing from several alternatives where each utility is associated with specific attributes that are also evaluated. Prospect:

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value as involving probabilities and decision-making, though they don't explicitly mention financial outcomes or the normative nature of the model.
- Correct: The student correctly describes expected utility as involving personal assessment of value/usefulness, capturing the subjective utility aspect that distinguishes it from expected value theory.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that multi-attribute utility involves multiple attributes that are evaluated, though they don't mention weights or the normative nature of the model.
- Incorrect: The student only wrote 'Prospect:' without providing any explanation of prospect theory, its descriptive nature, or its consideration of heuristics and biases.

Score: 0.75

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease peopleâ€™s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Loss aversion and risk aversion are closely linked. When potential losses are significant, individuals tend to avoid taking risks. However, if losses can be completely avoided, people focus more on the possible benefits of a situation.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that loss aversion makes people avoid taking risks when potential losses are significant. The answer key indicates the opposite - that people are willing to accept risk to avoid potential losses, meaning loss aversion can decrease risk aversion or even make people risk seeking.

Score: 0.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Classical conditioning involves creating a link between two events that can influence behavior. Operant conditioning involves encouraging preferred behaviors by applying punishments and rewards.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student does not define conditioning as learning associations through covariation. They only provide definitions for the two types of conditioning without addressing what conditioning is in general.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that classical conditioning involves creating a link between two events, which aligns with the concept of learning to associate things that happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly describes operant conditioning as involving rewards and punishments to encourage preferred behaviors, which matches the key point about learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation occurs when someone perceives a cause-and-effect relationship between two events that are merely correlated. Illusory correlation happens when a person believes there is a connection between two events even though no actual correlation exists.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly distinguishes between illusory causation (incorrectly interpreting correlation as causation) and illusory correlation (perceiving correlation where none exists). The explanation accurately captures both concepts with appropriate detail.

Score: 1.0

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to â€˜properlyâ€™ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

Birthday party etiquette is a schema because schemas provide a structured understanding of knowledge, including appropriate behavior in specific scenarios. On the other hand, knowing how the Dutch healthcare system operates is a script since it involves a sequence of steps to be taken.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the healthcare system as a script and birthday party behavior as a schema, which is the reverse of the correct answer. Healthcare system knowledge is a schema (organized knowledge/relationships), not a script.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies birthday party behavior as a schema rather than a script. Birthday party etiquette is a script because it describes sequential behavioral expectations in a specific social situation, not just organized knowledge.

Score: 0.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

Behaviourists would take the physical perspective, since it emphasizes observing the subject's behavior or physical characteristics.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: While the student correctly identifies the physical stance, their reasoning is incomplete. They mention observing behavior and physical characteristics but fail to explain the key causal relationship that behaviorists focused on - how stimuli cause or trigger behavioral responses. The answer key specifically emphasizes the stimulus-behavior causation process.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

Evolutionary theorists would use the Intentional stance because it considers motives, making it suitable for examining psychological processes.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the intentional stance instead of the design stance. While evolutionary psychology does examine psychological processes, it focuses on their functional design and adaptive purpose rather than beliefs and desires (which characterize the intentional stance). The design stance is appropriate because evolutionary psychologists analyze how psychological mechanisms are designed to solve adaptive problems.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Specific: A is the only cause of B happening. Within time and space: A and B take place sequentially in the same time period. Consistent: A has repeatedly led to B.

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies specificity/distinctness and explains that A is the only cause of B, which matches the concept that B follows A but not other events.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies consistency and explains that A repeatedly leads to B, which aligns with the idea that B always follows A.
- Incorrect: Student does not mention plausibility or the role of common sense in determining causation.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies contiguity in time and space, explaining that A and B occur sequentially in the same time period, which captures the temporal and spatial proximity concept.
- Incorrect: Student does not mention similarity in cause and effect or the concept that A and B should superficially resemble each other.

Score: 0.6

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Availability bias leads to overestimating moral outrage because when we can easily imagine ourselves feeling morally upset, we tend to assume many others feel the same. Similarly, negativity bias distorts our view by making a vocal minority expressing moral outrage on social media appear to be the majority.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions negativity bias but incorrectly describes it as making a vocal minority appear to be the majority, rather than explaining it as the tendency to seek out or place more weight on negative information like morally outraged content.
- Incorrect: The student mentions availability bias but misdefines it as imagining ourselves feeling upset, rather than correctly explaining it as estimating frequency based on how easily examples come to mind.
- Incorrect: The student does not explain the causal relationship between the two biases - how negativity bias increases exposure to moral outrage examples, which then leads availability heuristic to cause overestimation.

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

Non-delusional conspiracy theories might face less skepticism because they appear more detailed and credible when viewed through the perspective of cognitive shortcuts.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's answer discusses cognitive shortcuts and credibility but does not address the key distinction from the answer key - that delusional conspiracy theories are both irrational beliefs AND not commonly accepted, while non-delusional ones lack one or both of these characteristics.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you donâ€™t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

The primacy effect can disrupt this learning approach because when you doubt yourself, the incorrect answer you first selected remains more prominent in your memory than the correct one.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the primacy effect as the mechanism. The primacy effect refers to better recall of items at the beginning of a list, not the interference between incorrect and correct answers. The answer key requires understanding of source amnesia (forgetting the source of information) or proactive interference (old information interfering with new), neither of which the student demonstrates.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Major depressive disorder can cause you to focus more on negative outcomes, leading to decisions that are influenced by a bias toward negativity.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes depression as causing bias toward negativity, but fails to address the key point that this actually makes depressed individuals MORE accurate at predicting negative outcomes compared to non-depressed people who are overly optimistic. The answer misses that reduced optimism bias leads to greater accuracy.

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model examines previous events that led to a specific outcome. It promotes hindsight bias because, since the outcome has already happened, it is simpler to envision compared to alternative possibilities.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a causal model examines previous events leading to an outcome, which aligns with the concept of a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that causal models contribute to hindsight bias by making the actual outcome seem simpler to envision than alternatives, which corresponds to events seeming more inevitable than they were.

Score: 1.0

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Learning fosters hindsight bias because acquiring new information makes it difficult to evaluate a previous event without that added insight. This phenomenon is known as the curse of knowledge.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly explains that learning contributes to hindsight bias by making it difficult to evaluate past events without the influence of newly acquired information, and appropriately identifies this as the curse of knowledge phenomenon.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing emphasizes choosing the optimal option, while satisficing aims for a decision that is sufficient. Individuals with high levels of neuroticism tend to use the maximizing approach.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as choosing the optimal option, which aligns with 'trying to make the best choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as aiming for a decision that is sufficient, which matches 'making a good-enough choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that individuals with high neuroticism tend to use the maximizing approach, which matches the answer key.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

Since personalized exams can produce biased outcomes by depending too much on clinical intuition, I would incorporate a question bank such as slimstampen alongside a formal exam to assess both student engagement and knowledge. Frequent use of the question bank encourages better understanding and reflects increased student involvement.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement by proposing a concrete solution that addresses the constraint of limited resources while promoting active engagement. They suggest using a question bank system (slimstampen) combined with formal exams, showing understanding of how technology can facilitate scalable assessment while encouraging frequent student interaction with material.
