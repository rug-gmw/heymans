## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

In the model, System 1 plays a more influential role. It suggests that moral decisions are typically driven by our intuitions (System 1), and only in certain situations do we engage in deliberate reasoning (System 2). More often than not, rational thinking (System 2) serves to retrospectively justify the moral judgment initially formed by intuition (System 1).

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 is associated with intuitions in moral decision-making, which aligns with the answer key's requirement that System 1 refers to intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student clearly describes System 2 as 'deliberate reasoning' and 'rational thinking', which directly corresponds to the answer key's definition of System 2 as reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student explicitly states that 'System 1 plays a more influential role' and that moral decisions are 'typically driven by our intuitions (System 1)', clearly indicating System 1's dominance over System 2.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

The representativeness heuristic refers to people's tendency to assess whether something fits into a particular category by how closely it resembles the typical traits of that category. However, this often leads to overlooking the actual statistical likelihood of encountering an example from that category, a mistake known as base rate neglect.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process in this scenario.
- Correct: The student accurately explains the representativeness heuristic as assessing category membership based on resemblance to typical traits of that category, which matches the answer key's explanation about estimating likelihood based on similarity to stereotypes.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

- The primacy effect refers to our tendency to give more importance to information that is presented at the beginning. - Anchoring means we rely on the initial information as a baseline when evaluating subsequent information. - Both concepts explain how we often prioritize the information we receive first above all else.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as relying on initial information as a baseline, which aligns with the answer key's description of taking the first piece of information as the starting point.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as giving more importance to information presented at the beginning, which corresponds to the answer key's point about better remembering first information.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both concepts involve prioritizing first information, which matches the answer key's point about overreliance on the first piece of information.

Score: 1.0

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency to feel losses more intensely than equivalent gains. Risk aversion means favoring options that are more certain rather than those that involve greater risk.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves feeling losses more intensely than equivalent gains, which accurately captures the concept of weighing losses more heavily than gains.
- Correct: The student correctly explains risk aversion as favoring more certain options over those with greater risk, which aligns with the preference for certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 1.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias is a component of affective forecasting that refers to the common tendency for individuals to exaggerate how strongly their future emotions will be affected by their upcoming decisions. This can lead people to avoid ending relationships because they may overpredict the extent of their emotional pain after a breakup, even when they are dissatisfied in the relationship.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as the tendency to overestimate/exaggerate the impact of future events on future emotions, which matches the answer key definition.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that impact bias prevents breakups because people overpredict/overestimate how bad the emotional pain will be, which aligns with the answer key's explanation.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting refers to the process by which individuals attempt to anticipate their future emotional responses to events. People are typically not very accurate at making these predictions. This is significant because individuals must make decisions about their future care, such as through a living will, when they may no longer be able to express their wishes. However, due to our poor skill in affective forecasting, people often misjudge how they will feel later, creating an ethical challenge.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines affective forecasting as the process of anticipating future emotional responses to events, which aligns with the answer key's definition of predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of the key concept that people misjudge how they will feel in future situations, which relates to the answer key's point about healthy people predicting they'll prefer to die when sick but potentially changing their preference when actually sick.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

The theory suggests that individuals often overvalue small chances, such as 10%, but may consider extremely tiny probabilities, like 0.01%, as impossible.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that prospect theory suggests people overestimate (overvalue) low probabilities like 10%.
- Correct: The student accurately states that extremely low probabilities like 0.01% are treated as impossible, which aligns with the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

- Loss aversion represents negative utility because it is considered irrational.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly defines loss aversion as representing negative utility due to irrationality. The correct answer is that loss aversion means negative utilities (losses) are weighted more heavily than positive utilities (gains) of equal magnitude, reflecting the steeper slope of the value function for losses versus gains.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

- Expected utility theory takes into account subjective value rather than just financial results. - Expected utility theory includes the concept of risk aversion, which expected value theory does not.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected utility theory considers subjective value beyond just financial results, which aligns with the answer key point about expected utility dealing with non-financial values while expected value theory deals only with financial values.
- Correct: The student accurately states that expected utility theory includes risk aversion while expected value theory does not, which directly matches the answer key point about expected utility theory considering risk aversion whereas expected value theory does not consider heuristics and biases.

Score: 1.0

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

- Expected value theory is a normative model outlining how to make the most rational decision by using probabilities to maximize financial outcomes. - Expected utility theory, also normative, is similar to expected value theory but additionally takes into account subjective values of gains. - Multiple attribute theory is a normative model explaining how to choose optimally among options with multiple attributes, which may be subjective or financial. - Prospect theory is a descriptive model illustrating how people actually make decisions about prospects, influenced by heuristics and biases.

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies expected value theory as a normative model involving probabilities and financial outcomes, capturing the key elements from the answer key.
- Correct: Student accurately describes expected utility theory as normative and similar to expected value theory but incorporating subjective utilities beyond just financial outcomes.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies multi-attribute utility theory as a normative model for choosing among options with multiple attributes, though doesn't explicitly mention weights and utilities for each attribute.
- Correct: Student accurately describes prospect theory as a descriptive model showing how people actually make decisions, influenced by heuristics and biases, matching the behavioral aspect from the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Loss aversion causes individuals to be more cautious with risk because they fear potential losses more intensely than they value the possibility of gaining from taking a risk.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that loss aversion makes people more risk averse and cautious. The answer key indicates that loss aversion actually decreases risk aversion and can make people risk-seeking when they face potential losses, as they become willing to accept risk to avoid those losses.

Score: 0.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

- Conditioning involves learning to link events based on their occurrence together. - Classical conditioning refers to learning the connection between two stimuli that frequently occur simultaneously. - Operant conditioning involves learning to connect specific behaviors with their resulting rewards or consequences.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as learning to link events based on their occurrence together, which captures the essence of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as learning connections between two stimuli that occur simultaneously, which aligns with the key concept of associating things that happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning to connect behaviors with their resulting rewards or consequences, which matches the answer key's description of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation refers to the mistaken belief that one event causes another when it actually does not. Illusory correlation refers to the incorrect perception that two events frequently occur simultaneously.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that illusory causation involves mistakenly believing in a causal relationship that doesn't exist, and illusory correlation involves incorrectly perceiving that two variables are related when they aren't. While the wording differs from the answer key, the core concepts are accurately captured.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

- The healthcare system is a schema because it represents a mental structure containing related information. - The birthday party is a script since it outlines a culturally specific social schema for a familiar event.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the healthcare system as a schema and provides an accurate explanation that it represents a mental structure containing related information, which aligns with the answer key's explanation about knowledge and relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the birthday party behavior as a script and accurately explains it as a culturally specific social schema for a familiar event, which corresponds well with the answer key's description of a social schema for specific situational behavior.

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

They took a physical perspective, focusing solely on what is physically observable.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that behaviorists adopted the physical stance and provides an accurate explanation that they focused on physically observable phenomena, which aligns with the answer key's emphasis on focusing on processes that cause stimulus-behavior relationships.

Score: 1.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

They take the design stance by assessing the purpose or intended function of the human.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance and provides an accurate explanation that they assess purpose/function, which aligns with the answer key's emphasis on considering psychological processes in terms of their function.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Distinctiveness - My cat purrs B exclusively when I scratch it A Consistency - My cat consistently purrs B whenever I scratch it A Plausibility - It is reasonable that my cat purrs B when I scratch it A Continuity in time and space - My cat begins to purr B immediately after I scratch it A Similarity of cause and effect - When I kick a ball A and it hits another ball, that other ball starts rolling B

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies distinctiveness/distinctness and provides an appropriate example showing that B (purring) follows specifically from A (scratching) and not other events.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies consistency and demonstrates understanding with an example showing that B (purring) always follows A (scratching).
- Correct: Student correctly identifies plausibility and shows understanding that the causal relationship should make common sense.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies contiguity (written as 'continuity') in time and space, demonstrating understanding that A and B should occur close in time and location.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies similarity in cause and effect with an appropriate example showing how the cause (kicking/motion) resembles the effect (rolling/motion).

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

The negativity bias refers to the tendency for individuals to focus on negative emotional content, such as morally outraged material. The availability heuristic explains that people assess the likelihood of events based on how easily instances come to mind. Because negative content is more readily recalled due to negativity bias, especially morally outraged content, people are more likely to seek out such material. This combination causes us to overestimate the prevalence of morally outraged content on social media.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias as the tendency to focus on negative content, including morally outraged material, which aligns with the answer key's description of seeking out or placing more weight on negative information.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the availability heuristic as assessing likelihood based on how easily instances come to mind, which matches the answer key's definition of estimating frequency based on ease of recall.
- Correct: The student effectively explains the connection between the two biases - that negativity bias makes negative content more readily recalled, which through availability heuristic leads to overestimating prevalence of moral outrage, demonstrating understanding of how they work together.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

Framework theories are wide-ranging intuitive ideas that help us make sense of the world. Magical contagion occurs when principles from one area are applied to a completely different field. Here, a concept from biology (such as bacterial contamination) is applied to psychology, resulting in the belief that an object is somehow tainted by a person one dislikes.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that magical contagion involves applying biological concepts (like bacterial contamination/contagion) to the psychological/social domain, demonstrating understanding of how framework theories from one domain are inappropriately extended to another.

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A delusional conspiracy differs from a non-delusional conspiracy theory because it includes irrational ideas that are not accepted within the culture.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies both key criteria: irrational beliefs and lack of cultural acceptance, which aligns with the answer key's definition that delusional conspiracy theories are both irrational and not commonly accepted.

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

- narcissism - masculinity - less skilled in analytical reasoning - more likely to perceive patterns that do not actually exist

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies narcissism as a personality factor contributing to conspiratorial thinking, which matches the answer key.
- Correct: The student mentions masculinity, which corresponds to 'being a man' from the answer key as a demographic factor associated with conspiratorial thinking.
- Correct: The student identifies 'less skilled in analytical reasoning' which matches 'having a low level of analytical thinking' from the answer key, and 'more likely to perceive patterns that do not actually exist' corresponds to 'seeing patterns in randomness' from the answer key.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Availability heuristic - Writing down an incorrect answer and only reviewing the correct one can strengthen the memory of the wrong answer more than the right one. Because the more strongly consolidated answer is easier to recall, this may cause someone to mistakenly believe the incorrect answer is more likely to be true.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the availability heuristic as the mechanism. While they correctly describe how incorrect answers can interfere with learning, the availability heuristic relates to judging probability based on ease of recall, not forgetting the source of information. The correct mechanism is source amnesia, where one forgets that their initial answer was incorrect and mistakes it for the correct answer.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

They attempt to increase its attractiveness by repeatedly presenting it.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly identifies that repetition is used to increase attractiveness, but fails to name the specific psychological mechanism (mere exposure effect or illusory-truth effect) that explains why repetition works.

Score: 0.0

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

The condition typically improves our accuracy in making predictions, since we usually tend to overestimate our luck when thinking about the future. This tendency is known as the positivity bias.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that major depressive disorder improves accuracy in predictions by reducing overoptimistic tendencies. While they use 'positivity bias' instead of the more precise term 'optimism bias,' they demonstrate understanding of the core concept that depression reduces overly optimistic predictions, making people more accurate.

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

You continue to adjust your prior belief based on the sensory evidence, but to a lesser extent than you would if the reliability were greater.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student answer describes how prior beliefs are adjusted by sensory evidence, but the question asks about how prior beliefs influence perception when sensory reliability decreases. The correct answer is that prior beliefs have greater influence on perception when sensory information is unreliable, not that prior beliefs are adjusted to a lesser extent.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

- At the pre-conventional stage, individuals decide what is right or wrong based on the consequences of rewards or punishments. - At the conventional stage, moral decisions are guided by laws and the feelings or expectations of others. - At the post-conventional stage, people make moral judgments according to universal ethical principles, recognizing that some moral values can conflict with one another.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the pre-conventional level as focusing on consequences of rewards or punishments, which aligns with the answer key's description of obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as being guided by laws and feelings/expectations of others, which matches the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly describes the post-conventional level as making moral judgments according to universal ethical principles, which aligns with the answer key's focus on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

Causal models explain that we typically focus on reasons for why a particular outcome occurred. We don't usually consider explanations for alternative outcomes that did not happen. Because we only have reasons for the actual event, it often appears much more inevitable when looking back.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that causal models involve focusing on reasons/explanations for how events occurred, which aligns with the concept of a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student accurately explains how causal models contribute to hindsight bias by making actual events appear more inevitable in retrospect, since we focus only on reasons for what happened rather than considering alternative outcomes.

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Learning plays a role in hindsight bias because we naturally incorporate newly acquired information into our thinking. This new information can make the actual outcome appear more predictable.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that newly learned information is incorporated into thinking and affects our perception of past predictability, which captures the core mechanism of hindsight bias described in the answer key.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

- Maximizing refers to attempting to select the optimal option, while satisficing involves aiming for a choice that is sufficiently good. - People with high levels of neuroticism are more prone to use the maximizing decision approach, as both are connected to perfectionist tendencies.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as attempting to select the optimal option, which aligns with 'trying to make the best choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as aiming for a choice that is sufficiently good, which matches 'making a good-enough choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people with high neuroticism are more likely to use the maximizing decision style and provides valid reasoning linking both to perfectionist tendencies.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

I would aim to make a satisfactory decision for both the students and myself, possibly by using time-saving tools like AI, even if they aren't completely accurate, rather than striving for the absolute best choice, which could require sacrificing my time and overexerting myself, to achieve the most balanced solution.

Feedback:

- Correct: The answer demonstrates serious engagement with the question by addressing the core challenge of balancing student engagement with limited resources. The student proposes a practical solution using AI tools as a time-saving measure and shows understanding of the trade-offs involved (efficiency vs. perfect accuracy). The response reflects thoughtful consideration of the satisficing principle in educational contexts.
