## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

System 1 generates our moral instincts, leading to moral decisions that may be illogical. System 2 allows us to think critically and evaluate these moral decisions logically. System 1 is the primary system.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 involves moral instincts/intuitions, which aligns with the answer key's requirement about System 1 referring to intuitions or emotion.
- Correct: The student accurately describes System 2 as involving critical thinking and logical evaluation, which corresponds to the answer key's point about System 2 referring to reasoning or rational thought.
- Correct: The student clearly states that 'System 1 is the primary system,' which directly satisfies the answer key requirement that System 1 thinking is more dominant than System 2.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

The representativeness heuristic leads us to believe that something resembling the typical features of a particular group is indeed part of that group, without considering how frequent or infrequent that group actually is.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive bias in this scenario.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that the representativeness heuristic involves judging category membership based on resemblance to typical features/stereotypes of that group, which matches the answer key's explanation about estimating likelihood based on resemblance to stereotypes.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring refers to the tendency to rely on initial information when interpreting new data. The primacy effect involves forming judgments about others based on our initial impression, often ignoring subsequent information about them. Both phenomena share the difficulty of changing our initial perception even when presented with new, conflicting information.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as relying on initial information, which aligns with the answer key's description of taking the first piece of information as a starting point.
- Incorrect: The student describes the primacy effect as forming judgments about others based on initial impressions, but the answer key specifically refers to better remembering the first piece of information, which is different from judgment formation.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both phenomena involve difficulty changing initial perceptions when faced with new information, which captures the essence of overreliance on first information mentioned in the answer key.

Score: 0.6666666666666666

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion means that individuals perceive losses as more significant than gains of the same amount, whereas risk aversion refers to the tendency to avoid taking risks when it is unnecessary.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves perceiving losses as more significant than equivalent gains, which matches the key concept of weighing losses more heavily than gains.
- Incorrect: The student describes risk aversion as avoiding unnecessary risks, but misses the core concept that risk aversion is about preferring certainty over uncertainty regardless of necessity.

Score: 0.5

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias refers to the tendency to overpredict the intensity of our future negative emotions following a certain action. For example, individuals might avoid ending a relationship because they anticipate that the emotional consequences of a breakup will be worse than the dissatisfaction they are presently feeling.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies impact bias as overestimating the intensity of future emotions, which aligns with the answer key's definition of overestimating the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Correct: The student accurately explains how impact bias prevents breakups by describing how people anticipate worse emotional consequences from breaking up than their current dissatisfaction, which matches the answer key's point about overestimating how bad a break-up will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves anticipating our future emotions. This concept is crucial in end-of-life choices, as our current feelings might differ from how we will feel later, potentially leading to decisions that aren't aligned with our future well-being.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies affective forecasting as anticipating or predicting future emotions, which aligns with the answer key's definition of 'predictions about our own future emotional state.'
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of the key concept that current feelings might differ from future feelings in end-of-life contexts, which captures the essence of how healthy people's predictions about preferring death when sick may not match their actual preferences when they become ill.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

People tend to exaggerate the likelihood of rare events, yet extremely unlikely outcomes are frequently seen as impossible.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people 'exaggerate the likelihood of rare events,' which aligns with the answer key point that merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Correct: The student accurately states that 'extremely unlikely outcomes are frequently seen as impossible,' which directly matches the answer key point about extremely low probabilities being interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Avoiding losses requires effort, which results in a negative value.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly focuses on effort and negative value rather than the core concept of loss aversion, which is that losses are weighted more heavily than equivalent gains in the utility function. The answer does not address the asymmetric weighting or steeper slope for losses versus gains.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected utility theory accounts for both non-financial benefits and drawbacks, as well as the individual's attitude toward risk, whereas expected value theory ignores these aspects.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected utility theory accounts for non-financial benefits and drawbacks while expected value theory ignores these aspects, which aligns with the answer key point about financial vs non-financial values.
- Correct: The student correctly mentions that expected utility theory considers individual's attitude toward risk while expected value theory ignores this, which corresponds to the answer key point about risk aversion vs no consideration of heuristics and biases.

Score: 1.0

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected value theory is a normative approach that calculates financial outcomes based on probabilities. Expected utility theory, also normative, differs by incorporating not only financial factors but also utility, such as non-financial aspects and risk preferences. Multi-attribute utility theory assigns specific values and weights to different utilities, combining them to guide decision-making. Prospect theory aligns with expected utility theory but additionally accounts for heuristics and cognitive biases.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as a normative model that calculates financial outcomes based on probabilities, which matches the key point about choosing between options with financial outcomes and probabilities.
- Correct: The student accurately describes expected utility theory as similar to expected value theory but incorporating utility beyond just financial factors, including risk preferences, which aligns with the answer key's explanation of subjective utility.
- Correct: The student correctly explains multi-attribute utility theory as assigning values and weights to different utilities/attributes and combining them for decision-making, which matches the answer key's description of multiple attributes with utilities and weights.
- Correct: The student accurately describes prospect theory as similar to expected utility theory but additionally accounting for heuristics and cognitive biases, which matches the answer key's description of it being a descriptive/behavioral model with heuristics and biases.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Loss aversion means that individuals perceive losses as more significant than gains of the same amount. Consequently, this leads them to be more cautious and avoid taking risks to prevent losing what they have.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly defines loss aversion but incorrectly concludes it makes people more risk averse. The answer key specifies that loss aversion can actually decrease risk aversion and make people risk-seeking when facing potential losses, as people become willing to accept risk to avoid losses.

Score: 0.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves learning to link events. Classical conditioning refers to understanding the relationship between two events occurring together. Operant conditioning involves recognizing that a specific behavior leads to a consequence, either a reward or a punishment.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as learning to link events, which aligns with learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as understanding relationships between two events occurring together, which matches the key point about learning associations when things happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as recognizing that behavior leads to consequences (rewards or punishments), which directly corresponds to the answer key's definition of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation occurs when we think that one event causes another, even though it does not. The events might still be connected in some other manner. In contrast, illusory correlation leads us to believe there is a relationship between events when, in reality, no such connection exists.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly distinguishes that illusory causation involves incorrectly attributing a causal relationship (while acknowledging events might be connected otherwise, implying correlation may exist), whereas illusory correlation involves perceiving a relationship where none actually exists. This captures the key difference between misinterpreting correlation as causation versus perceiving non-existent correlation.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

A schema is a structure that aids in interpreting a situation using previous knowledge, guiding our understanding of the objects or rules related to certain ideas. A script is a type of social schema that applies to typical situations. For instance, understanding the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, whereas knowing the expected behavior at a birthday party is a script.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that understanding the Dutch healthcare system is a schema and provides appropriate reasoning that schemas involve structures for interpreting situations using previous knowledge, which aligns with the answer key's emphasis on knowledge and relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that knowing expected behavior at a birthday party is a script and demonstrates understanding that scripts are social schemas for typical situations, which matches the answer key's description of scripts as social schemas for specific behavioral situations.

Score: 1.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

They took a physical approach, focusing solely on the body's reaction to a stimulus without considering the individual's thoughts.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that behaviorists adopted the physical stance and accurately explains that they focused on observable bodily reactions to stimuli while excluding mental processes from consideration, which aligns with the answer key's emphasis on focusing on stimulus-behavior processes.

Score: 1.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

From a design standpoint, they examine the purpose of ingroup favoritism by considering its role and advantages from an evolutionary viewpoint.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance and provides appropriate reasoning by explaining they examine the 'purpose' and 'role' of psychological processes like ingroup favoritism from an evolutionary perspective, which aligns with the functional approach described in the answer key.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

1. Specificity: Event A leads directly to event B. 2. Consistency: Whenever event A occurs repeatedly, event B consistently follows each time. 3. Plausibility: Based on existing knowledge, it is reasonable to believe that event A could cause event B. 4. Contiguity in space and time: Event B takes place shortly after event A and in the same location. 5. Similarity in cause and effect: If the effect (whether large or small) of event B aligns with event A, it can be inferred that event A causes event B.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies specificity/distinctness, explaining that A leads directly to B, which captures the essence that B follows A but not other events.
- Correct: The student accurately describes consistency, stating that B consistently follows A whenever A occurs repeatedly, which matches the answer key's requirement that B always follows A.
- Correct: The student correctly explains plausibility as being based on existing knowledge that makes it reasonable to believe A could cause B, which aligns with the common sense requirement in the answer key.
- Correct: The student properly identifies contiguity in space and time, explaining that B occurs shortly after A in the same location, which matches the answer key's requirement for same time and location.
- Incorrect: The student's explanation of similarity is unclear and doesn't capture the key concept that A and B should superficially resemble each other. The phrasing about 'effect aligning with event A' is confusing and doesn't address resemblance between cause and effect.

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Negativity bias leads us to focus on negative emotions, causing increased moral outrage. This is related to the availability heuristic, where we believe that things that are easier to recall are more frequent. Because we often encounter negative content due to our negativity bias, the availability heuristic makes the world appear worse than it is, which heightens moral outrage.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias and explains that it leads us to focus on negative content/emotions, which aligns with the answer key's description of seeking out or placing more weight on negative information like morally outraged content.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the availability heuristic and accurately describes it as the tendency to believe things that are easier to recall are more frequent, which matches the answer key's definition of estimating frequency based on ease of recall.
- Incorrect: While the student attempts to connect the two biases, they don't clearly explain the specific mechanism described in the answer key - that negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage which then leads the availability heuristic to cause overestimation of how many people are morally outraged. The student's explanation is more general about the world appearing worse rather than specifically about overestimating the prevalence of moral outrage.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

We generally hold intuitive beliefs about how the world operates, linking a specific object to the character of its owner by applying understanding from one area to assign that quality to the object.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that this involves applying understanding from one domain (biological contagion) to another domain (social/psychological), which is the core concept of framework theories being misapplied across domains.

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

Delusional conspiracy theories are not widely accepted or believed within a culture, whereas non-delusional conspiracy theories are embraced and accepted by the culture.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student only identifies the 'not commonly accepted' criterion but completely omits the crucial 'irrational belief' component. According to the answer key, both conditions (irrational belief AND not commonly accepted) are required for a conspiracy theory to be considered delusional.

Score: 0.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

1. Perceiving connections that don't truly exist. 2. Experiencing a sense of loneliness. 3. Reduced intelligence.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student's answer 'Perceiving connections that don't truly exist' correctly identifies the factor of 'seeing patterns in randomness' from the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student mentions 'experiencing a sense of loneliness' which is not listed among the cognitive and personality factors in the answer key.
- Correct: The student's answer 'Reduced intelligence' correctly corresponds to 'having a low level of intelligence' from the answer key.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Individuals will recall the responses without truly verifying whether these answers are right or wrong according to the content they reviewed.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the core mechanism - that people may recall their initial incorrect responses without properly distinguishing whether those responses were right or wrong. This captures the essence of source amnesia, where the source of information (that it was an incorrect guess) is forgotten while the content is retained.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

Participatory propaganda involves convincing people to genuinely accept a message by repeating it often, even if the message is false.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes a concept related to propaganda and repetition but does not identify the specific psychological mechanism. The answer key requires identifying 'mere exposure' (the tendency to prefer familiar things) or the 'illusory-truth effect.' The student's response about 'participatory propaganda' does not demonstrate knowledge of these psychological concepts.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Yes, because their perception of the world is darker than the reality.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that major depressive disorder makes people less accurate at predictions due to a 'darker perception.' The correct answer is that people with major depressive disorder are actually more accurate because they have reduced optimism bias, not because they have distorted negative perceptions.

Score: 0.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

As sensory information becomes less reliable, prior beliefs play a greater role in shaping perception.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when sensory information becomes less reliable, prior beliefs have a greater influence on perception, which directly matches the key concept from the answer key.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

Pre-conventional stage: individuals behave morally solely for personal benefit, considering rewards and consequences. Conventional stage: individuals follow moral behavior to maintain social norms and relationships. Post-conventional stage: individuals recognize that moral principles can clash, so they base their actions on broader ethical values.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the pre-conventional level as focusing on personal benefit, rewards and consequences, which aligns with avoiding punishment and gaining rewards from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as following moral behavior to maintain social norms and relationships, which matches the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the post-conventional level as being based on broader ethical values and recognizing conflicts between moral principles, which corresponds to the answer key's focus on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

The causal model of past events helps individuals better recall what truly happened rather than what might have happened. Because imagining alternative possibilities is difficult, it creates the false impression that the outcome was predictable from the start, leading to hindsight bias.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student does not clearly define what a causal model is. They mention it helps recall what happened but don't explain that it's a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student correctly explains how causal models contribute to hindsight bias by making outcomes seem predictable from the start, which aligns with the key point that events seem more inevitable than they were.

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

You cannot reflect on your mindset during a decision without factoring in information you gained afterward, which can lead to the false belief that you always anticipated the outcome.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that newly learned information cannot be avoided when reflecting on past judgments, leading to distorted recollections of what was anticipated. This captures the core mechanism of how learning contributes to hindsight bias.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

A maximizing decision style involves seeking the best possible option, whereas a satisficing decision style focuses on selecting an option that is sufficiently satisfactory. The maximizing approach is linked to the personality trait of neuroticism.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as seeking the best possible option, which aligns with 'trying to make the best choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as selecting an option that is sufficiently satisfactory, which matches the concept of 'making a good-enough choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that the maximizing approach is linked to neuroticism, which corresponds to the answer key stating that high neuroticism leads to adopting the maximizing decision style.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

There might be a midterm that offers the chance to earn extra points for the final exam, encouraging students to engage with the material earlier in the course. Additionally, requiring students to complete weekly review tests could ensure they study the material more regularly.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement by proposing two specific, practical strategies: a midterm with extra credit incentives and weekly review tests. Both approaches address the core challenge of promoting active engagement while being scalable and not requiring intensive personalized feedback. The answer shows understanding of the constraint of limited time/resources and offers concrete solutions.
