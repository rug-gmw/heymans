## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

Jonathan Haidt's social-intuitionist model suggests that moral judgments primarily stem from system 1, which relies on intuition and gut reactions. System 2 might be involved later if a person chooses to rationalize their judgment, but it is not always engaged. Consequently, system 1 is considered the more influential factor in making moral judgments.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 relies on intuition and gut reactions, which aligns with the answer key's requirement that System 1 refers to intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student mentions that System 2 is involved in rationalization, which correctly identifies System 2 as reasoning/rational thought as specified in the answer key.
- Correct: The student clearly states that System 1 is 'the more influential factor' and 'primarily' drives moral judgments, correctly identifying System 1 as dominant over System 2.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

This aligns with the representativeness heuristic, which estimates the likelihood of an event by how closely it matches a particular category. Consequently, event A is considered more likely than event B if it better fits the characteristics of that category.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process in this scenario.
- Correct: The student provides an accurate explanation of the representativeness heuristic, describing how it involves estimating likelihood based on how well something matches category characteristics, which aligns with the answer key's explanation about resembling stereotypes.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring is the tendency to rely on an initial piece of information as a reference point when making estimates. The primacy effect occurs when the first information received has a much greater impact on a person's judgment than later information. Both affect decision-making, with the anchor serving as the key factor shaping judgment in the primacy effect.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as relying on initial information as a reference point, which aligns with the answer key's description of taking the first piece of information as the starting point.
- Incorrect: The student describes the primacy effect as first information having greater impact on judgment rather than better remembering first information. This conflates judgment influence with memory retention.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both phenomena involve overreliance on first/initial information, though they frame it as affecting decision-making rather than explicitly stating overreliance on first information.

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion, linked to utility, describes the tendency of people to prefer avoiding losses rather than acquiring equivalent gains. In contrast, risk aversion, related to probability, is the tendency to shy away from uncertain scenarios.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves preferring to avoid losses rather than acquiring equivalent gains, which matches the answer key's definition.
- Correct: The student accurately describes risk aversion as the tendency to shy away from uncertain scenarios, which aligns with the answer key's definition of preferring certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 1.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias, a feature of affective forecasting, is the tendency for people to overestimate how much a future event will affect their emotions. For example, individuals may think a breakup will deeply affect their mood, causing intense sadness and stress, which leads them to avoid the situation.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as the tendency to overestimate how much a future event will affect emotions, which aligns with the answer key's definition of overestimating the impact of future events on future feelings.
- Correct: The student clearly explains how impact bias prevents breakups by stating that people think a breakup will deeply affect their mood with intense sadness and stress, leading them to avoid the situation, which matches the answer key's point about overestimating how bad a breakup will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting is the process of anticipating how one will feel emotionally in response to a future event. This concept is significant because it connects to the disability paradox, which suggests that healthy individuals often believe they would choose death over enduring pain. However, the paradox lies in the fact that when faced with a serious condition, most people tend to reconsider and desire to live as long as they can.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines affective forecasting as anticipating future emotional responses to events, which aligns with the answer key's definition of predictions about future emotional states.
- Correct: The student accurately captures the key concept that healthy people predict they would prefer death when sick, but when actually facing illness, they typically want to continue living, which matches the answer key's explanation of the discrepancy between predicted and actual preferences.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

Prospect theory suggests that individuals tend to exaggerate the likelihood of events with low probabilities. While there is a distinction between a 10% chance and a 0.01% chance, the former is often perceived as more likely than it actually is, whereas the latter is typically seen as nearly impossible.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that low probabilities (like 10%) are overestimated, stating they are 'perceived as more likely than it actually is.'
- Correct: The student accurately captures that extremely low probabilities (like 0.01%) are treated as 'nearly impossible,' which aligns with the answer key's point about them being interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion, related to utility, describes the human preference for avoiding losses rather than pursuing equivalent gains.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes loss aversion as a preference for avoiding losses over pursuing gains, which is correct but incomplete. The answer key specifically requires explaining that loss aversion means negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities, or that the value function is steeper for losses than gains. The student's answer doesn't address the mathematical/functional form aspect of how losses and gains are weighted differently in the utility function.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

The key distinction between the two is that expected value theory is limited to monetary values, while expected utility theory can evaluate the appropriateness of a decision using any kind of utility, making it more subjective. Moreover, expected utility theory accounts for individuals' natural inclination toward risk aversion.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory is limited to monetary values while expected utility theory can handle any kind of utility (non-financial values), making it more comprehensive.
- Correct: The student accurately recognizes that expected utility theory accounts for risk aversion, which is a behavioral consideration that expected value theory does not incorporate.

Score: 1.0

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

- Expected value theory is a normative approach suggesting that the best choice is the one with the highest financial return. It is limited to monetary values, ignores heuristics, and assumes complete information about options and their probabilities.  
- Expected utility theory, also normative, closely resembles expected value theory but is not limited to financial outcomes. It accounts for risk aversion and also assumes full knowledge of choices and their probabilities.  
- Multi-attribute utility theory, another normative model, extends expected utility theory by providing guidance on decisions involving multiple options, each characterized by various attributes, with each attribute assigned a specific utility and importance.  
- Prospect theory is a descriptive model akin to expected utility theory, but incorporates heuristics and assumes that people evaluate choices based on perceived gains and losses.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as a normative model dealing with financial outcomes and probabilities, capturing the essential elements from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes expected utility theory as normative, similar to expected value theory but extending beyond financial outcomes to include subjective utility, which matches the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies multi-attribute utility theory as a normative model involving multiple attributes with utilities and importance (weights), aligning well with the answer key description.
- Correct: The student properly characterizes prospect theory as a descriptive model similar to expected utility theory but incorporating heuristics and biases (gains/losses perspective), matching the answer key requirements.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Loss aversion is the tendency of people to prefer avoiding losses rather than acquiring equivalent gains. This can lead individuals to become more cautious and avoid taking risks, especially in uncertain situations. Because unpredictable outcomes may result in emotional or financial setbacks, people often exhibit loss aversion, which in turn drives their risk-averse behavior.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that loss aversion makes people more risk-averse and cautious. The answer key indicates that loss aversion actually decreases risk aversion and can make people risk-seeking when trying to avoid potential losses. The student has the relationship backwards.

Score: 0.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning is a form of learning based on the association between events and can be divided into: - Classical conditioning, which involves learning that one event predicts or causes another - Operant conditioning, which involves learning that a behavior results in a specific outcome.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as a form of learning based on associations between events, which aligns with the answer key's definition of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as learning that one event predicts or causes another, which matches the answer key's explanation of learning to associate things that happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning that a behavior results in a specific outcome, which corresponds to the answer key's description of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation is the mistaken belief that one event (A) directly causes another event (B), while illusory correlation is the incorrect assumption that two events are related or linked.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly distinguishes that illusory causation involves mistakenly inferring a causal relationship between events, while illusory correlation involves incorrectly perceiving a relationship/correlation between variables that aren't actually related. The core distinction between misinterpreting causation versus perceiving non-existent correlation is accurately captured.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

The Dutch healthcare system operates according to a schema, while appropriate behavior at a birthday party follows a script. This is because schemas represent broad knowledge about what to expect in certain situations (such as the functioning of the Dutch healthcare system), whereas scripts are a specific kind of schema that involve detailed knowledge about familiar, routine events (like attending a party).

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that the Dutch healthcare system is a schema and provides an accurate explanation that schemas represent broad knowledge about what to expect in certain situations.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that birthday party behavior follows a script and accurately explains that scripts are specific schemas involving detailed knowledge about routine events and social situations.

Score: 1.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

Behaviourists take a mechanical approach because it aims to explain behavior through physical changes in a person. Specifically, behaviourists focus on how stimuli physically influence an individual's behavior.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that behaviorists adopted the physical stance (described as 'mechanical approach') and provides the right reasoning - they focused on how stimuli physically influence behavior, which aligns with the answer key's explanation about focusing on processes that cause stimuli to result in behavior.

Score: 1.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

Evolutionary psychologists might take a functional perspective to understand behavior. For instance, ingroup favoritism can be explained by the idea that protection serves a practical purpose and is thus beneficial for survival over time.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes a functional perspective but does not specifically identify this as the 'design stance' from Dennett's levels of analysis, which was the key requirement of the question.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

- Coherence, meaning if something happens to one person, others should experience the same outcome from event A.  
- Distinctiveness, indicating that event B is caused specifically by event A and not by any other event.  
- Contingency in time and space, requiring that event A occurs before event B, both events happen close together in time and location.  
- Plausibility, meaning it must be believable that event A could cause event B.  
- Similarity in cause and effect, where the nature of event A and its resulting effect event B share comparable characteristics.  
- Consistency, meaning event A must reliably cause event B every time it occurs.

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies distinctiveness and explains it as event B being caused specifically by event A and not by other events, which matches the answer key's concept of distinctness/specificity.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies consistency and explains it as event A reliably causing event B every time, which aligns with the answer key's definition that B always follows A.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies plausibility and explains it as requiring believability that A could cause B, which matches the answer key's common sense requirement.
- Correct: Student identifies 'contingency in time and space' which closely matches the answer key's 'contiguity in time and space', and correctly explains temporal precedence and spatial/temporal proximity.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies similarity in cause and effect and explains it as comparable characteristics between A and B, which matches the answer key's concept of superficial resemblance.

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

This is explained by the availability heuristic, which suggests that events that are easier to remember are perceived as more likely to happen, and the negativity bias, which is the inclination to focus on negative emotions. Together, these biases cause negative incidents and opinions, such as morally outraged remarks, to be seen as frequent and widely accepted.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias and describes it as the inclination to focus on negative emotions, which aligns with the answer key's description of placing more weight on negative information like morally outraged content.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the availability heuristic and accurately describes it as events that are easier to remember being perceived as more likely to happen, which matches the answer key's definition of estimating frequency based on ease of recall.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of how these biases work together, explaining that they cause negative incidents like moral outrage to be seen as frequent and widely accepted, which captures the key mechanism described in the answer key.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

The belief in the magical contagion effect, along with other paranormal phenomena, can stem from the incorrect use of framework theories. People may apply everyday understanding from one area to interpret events in a different context, which can lead to inaccurate conclusions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that magical contagion involves the incorrect application of framework theories from one domain to another context, which aligns with the answer key's point about biological contagion concepts being misapplied to social/psychological domains.

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A delusion is an irrational belief that is not accepted within a culture. Thus, a delusional conspiracy theory is one that is not widely accepted by a culture, while a non-delusional conspiracy theory is commonly believed.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a delusional conspiracy theory requires both irrationality and lack of common acceptance, while a non-delusional conspiracy theory is commonly accepted. The answer captures the key distinction even though it doesn't explicitly mention irrationality as a separate criterion for the delusional case.

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

- Trust straightforward explanations in a complicated world - Recognize order within chaos - Embrace both confidence and self-focus

Feedback:

- Correct: This corresponds to 'believing in simple explanations for complex events' from the answer key, as the student describes trusting straightforward explanations for complicated situations.
- Correct: This matches 'seeing patterns in randomness' from the answer key, as recognizing order within chaos describes the tendency to perceive meaningful patterns where none exist.
- Correct: This aligns with 'being narcissistic' from the answer key, as embracing confidence and self-focus describes narcissistic traits that contribute to conspiratorial thinking.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

The continued influence theory suggests that once a belief (such as an answer) has been established, it remains difficult to eliminate, even if the individual does not show belief perseverance and accepts the new conflicting information as accurate.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the continued-influence effect as a mechanism by which incorrect answers can interfere with learning, which matches one of the alternative answers provided in the answer key. The explanation demonstrates understanding that initially formed beliefs/answers can persist and interfere with new correct information.

Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

The mere exposure effect refers to the tendency of people to prefer things simply because they are familiar with them.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) often lack the optimism bias, which is the natural tendency to think they are less likely to face negative events and more likely to encounter positive ones. This bias can sometimes result in unrealistic assessments, meaning those with MDD may actually make more accurate predictions. However, it is important to note that their extremely negative thinking may cause them to believe they are more vulnerable to negative events, potentially making their predictions less accurate.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people with MDD are more accurate at predictions due to reduced optimism bias, which aligns with the answer key. While they add nuance about potential inaccuracy from extreme negative thinking, they still capture the core concept that MDD leads to greater accuracy in predictions about negative events.

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

When sensory information becomes less reliable, prior beliefs have a greater impact on perception, causing actual perception to align more closely with those prior beliefs.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when sensory information becomes less reliable, prior beliefs have a greater impact on perception. This directly matches the answer key's requirement that perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs when sensory reliability decreases.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

- At the pre-conventional stage, moral decisions are based on avoiding punishment and seeking rewards. - At the conventional stage, moral decisions are guided by the feelings and expectations of others. - At the post-conventional stage, moral decisions are based on universal ethical principles.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the pre-conventional level as focusing on avoiding punishment and seeking rewards, which matches the answer key's description of obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as being guided by feelings and expectations of others, which aligns with the answer key's description of focusing on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly describes the post-conventional level as being based on universal ethical principles, which matches the answer key's description of focusing on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

The causal model, grounded in the hypothetical paradigm, suggests that people naturally create causal explanations to make sense of results. Consequently, they concentrate on information that confirms what is already known, making it difficult to disregard prior knowledge. This leads to hindsight bias and a perception that the event was more predictable than it actually was.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a causal model involves creating causal explanations to make sense of events, which aligns with the concept of a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student accurately explains how causal models contribute to hindsight bias by making events seem more predictable than they actually were, which matches the key point about events appearing more inevitable than they were.

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Learning ensures that individuals inevitably incorporate newly obtained information when evaluating actual outcomes, which alters their previous probability assessments.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that learning causes people to incorporate newly acquired information when making retrospective judgments, which changes their ability to accurately recall past probability assessments. This captures the core mechanism of how learning contributes to hindsight bias.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

The satisficing decision style aims to find options that are sufficiently satisfactory, while the maximizing decision style strives to select the best possible choice every time. Individuals who score high on the neuroticism personality trait are more likely to use a maximizing decision style.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as 'strives to select the best possible choice every time' which aligns with 'trying to make the best choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as finding 'options that are sufficiently satisfactory' which corresponds to 'making a good-enough choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that individuals high in neuroticism are more likely to use a maximizing decision style, which matches the answer key exactly.

Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point.

Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

Utilizing heuristics can likely enhance active participation, for instance: - The mere exposure effect suggests that individuals are more drawn to information they recognize. Providing examples that students relate to and find familiar may boost their engagement. - Negativity bias highlights the human inclination to focus on negative emotions. Offering examples of psychological processes that lead to negative outcomes might help students retain information more effectively and encourage them to engage actively by looking for additional examples.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement by applying specific psychological heuristics (mere exposure effect and negativity bias) to the practical problem of student engagement. They provide concrete, actionable strategies that show understanding of how cognitive biases can be leveraged in educational settings, directly addressing the challenge of promoting active engagement with limited resources.
