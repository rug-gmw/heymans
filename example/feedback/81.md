## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

The social intuitionist model suggests that our moral judgments stem from immediate gut feelings or intuitions, which are emotional reactions. Therefore, moral judgments primarily rely on system 1 thinking, while system 2 thinking mainly provides a retrospective justification for these intuitions. Consequently, system 1 is the more influential process, as our moral decisions are largely driven by emotions and intuitions characteristic of system 1 thinking.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 thinking involves intuitions and emotional reactions, stating that moral judgments stem from 'immediate gut feelings or intuitions, which are emotional reactions.'
- Correct: The student accurately describes System 2 thinking as providing 'retrospective justification,' which aligns with the answer key's description of reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student clearly states that 'system 1 is the more influential process' and that moral decisions are 'largely driven by emotions and intuitions,' correctly identifying System 1 as dominant.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

Representativeness heuristic refers to assessing the likelihood that an item fits into a category by how closely it matches the typical examples or characteristics of that category.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying assumption, which matches the first point in the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that the representativeness heuristic involves assessing likelihood of category membership based on how closely something matches typical characteristics of that category, which aligns with the answer key's explanation about estimating likelihood based on resemblance to stereotypes.

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring involves using initial information as a benchmark for making later decisions, whereas the primacy effect refers to the strong influence that the first piece of information has on our memory. Both share the idea that early information significantly shapes our memory.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as using initial information as a benchmark for later decisions, which aligns with the answer key's description of taking first information as a starting point.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as the strong influence of first information on memory, which matches the answer key's emphasis on better remembering first information.
- Correct: The student identifies that both concepts share the characteristic of early information significantly shaping memory, which captures the essence of overreliance on first information from the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Risk aversion refers to the tendency to prefer certain outcomes over uncertain ones, whereas loss aversion means giving greater importance to losses compared to gains.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves giving greater importance to losses compared to gains, which matches the answer key's definition of weighing losses more heavily than gains.
- Correct: The student accurately describes risk aversion as the tendency to prefer certain outcomes over uncertain ones, which aligns with the answer key's definition of preferring certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 1.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias refers to our tendency to exaggerate how much a future event will affect our emotional wellbeing. For example, people may avoid breaking up because they believe it will make them very unhappy, but they actually overestimate the extent of that unhappiness.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as the tendency to exaggerate how much a future event will affect emotional wellbeing, which matches the answer key's definition of overestimating the impact of future events on future feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly explains that impact bias prevents breakups because people overestimate how unhappy the breakup will make them, which directly aligns with the answer key's explanation.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves predicting how we will feel in the future. It is crucial for end-of-life choices because, at that time, disabilities such as memory loss can impair our ability to make sound decisions. Therefore, preparing a "living will" or outlining medical preferences in advance is important to ensure that doctors and caregivers understand your wishes when you reach the end of your life.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies affective forecasting as predicting future emotional states, which aligns with the answer key's definition of 'predictions about our own future emotional state.'
- Incorrect: The student focuses on cognitive impairment and advance directives rather than addressing the key concept that healthy people may inaccurately predict their preferences when sick, missing the core insight about the disconnect between predicted and actual preferences.

Score: 0.5

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

People tend to overvalue small chances, yet they consider extremely unlikely events as impossible.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people overvalue small chances, which aligns with prospect theory's finding that merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Correct: The student accurately states that extremely unlikely events are considered as impossible, which matches the answer key's point about extremely low probabilities being interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency of people to value avoiding losses more highly than obtaining equivalent gains.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly describes the general concept of loss aversion but fails to explain it specifically in terms of utility in prospect theory. The answer key requires explaining that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities or that the value function is steeper for losses than gains, which the student does not address.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected utility theory takes into account risk aversion, unlike expected value theory. Additionally, expected utility theory can incorporate non-monetary outcomes, allowing it to address subjective results.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected utility theory can incorporate non-monetary/non-financial outcomes while expected value theory deals only with financial values, though they use slightly different terminology ('non-monetary' vs 'non-financial').
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected utility theory considers risk aversion while expected value theory does not, which aligns with the answer key's point about heuristics and biases vs. risk aversion.

Score: 1.0

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected value theory suggests that individuals make choices among various options, each with multiple potential financial results. Expected utility theory builds on this by also taking into account non-financial outcomes. Multi-attribute theory involves selecting from options that have different attributes, each with its own utility and weight. Prospect theory further expands expected utility theory by incorporating the influence of biases and heuristics.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as involving choices among options with multiple potential financial outcomes, which aligns with the answer key's description of financial outcomes with probabilities.
- Correct: The student accurately describes expected utility theory as building on expected value theory while incorporating non-financial outcomes, matching the answer key's explanation of subjective utility beyond financial measures.
- Correct: The student correctly describes multi-attribute theory as involving options with different attributes that have their own utility and weight, which matches the answer key's description of multiple attributes with utilities and weights.
- Correct: The student accurately identifies prospect theory as expanding expected utility theory by incorporating biases and heuristics, which aligns with the answer key's description of it as a descriptive model that considers heuristics and biases.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

When individuals are loss-averse, they try to steer clear of losses. As a result, they tend to take on more risk, opting for uncertain outcomes in an attempt to prevent losses. Consequently, being more risk-seeking means they are less averse to risk.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion leads people to take on more risk to avoid losses, making them less risk averse and potentially risk-seeking. This directly matches the key point that loss aversion decreases risk aversion and can make people risk seeking.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves learning connections through repeated occurrences. In classical conditioning, we associate two events that frequently occur together in time and place, whereas in operant conditioning, we learn that certain behaviors lead to rewards or consequences.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as learning connections/associations through repeated occurrences, which aligns with the concept of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as associating two events that frequently occur together in time and place, which matches the answer key's description of learning to associate things that happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning that certain behaviors lead to rewards or consequences, which corresponds to the answer key's definition of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory correlation involves perceiving a relationship that isn't actually present, whereas illusory causation occurs when a real correlation exists but there is no cause-and-effect connection.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that illusory correlation involves perceiving a relationship that doesn't exist, and that illusory causation occurs when correlation is mistaken for causation. The phrasing 'real correlation exists but there is no cause-and-effect connection' accurately captures that illusory causation involves misinterpreting correlation as causation.

Score: 1.0

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

The way to "appropriately" act at a birthday party is a script, as it represents a collection of common knowledge for highly predictable events. The functioning of the Dutch healthcare system serves as an example of a schema, since it encompasses general knowledge about what one anticipates in a particular context, in this instance, healthcare.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that understanding the Dutch healthcare system is a schema and provides appropriate reasoning, explaining it as 'general knowledge about what one anticipates in a particular context' which aligns with schemas being knowledge structures about relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script and provides good reasoning, describing it as 'a collection of common knowledge for highly predictable events' which correctly captures the script concept as behavioral sequences for specific situations.

Score: 1.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

Intentional stance involves interpreting the actions of a system or individual by assigning intentions or beliefs, rather than describing them through physical characteristics.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student defines the intentional stance but does not answer the question. The question asks which stance behaviorists adopted and why. The correct answer is that behaviorists adopted the physical stance because they focused on stimulus-response mechanisms, but the student neither identifies the physical stance nor explains behaviorists' approach.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

The design stance is an approach that describes psychological processes based on their roles or objectives.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the design stance and provides an accurate description of it as focusing on roles/objectives/functions of psychological processes, which aligns with how evolutionary psychologists analyze mental phenomena in terms of their adaptive purposes.

Score: 1.0

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Unique; B occurs after A, but not after any other events. Reliable; B consistently happens following A. Believable; it is reasonable to think that A causes B. Comparable in cause and outcome; A and B share similarities in cause and effect, so they should be alike in scale. Adjacent in time and location; A and B take place in the same position.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies distinctness/specificity with 'Unique' and explains that B occurs after A but not after other events, which matches the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies consistency with 'Reliable' and explains that B consistently happens following A, which aligns with the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies plausibility with 'Believable' and explains it's reasonable to think A causes B, matching the answer key's common sense explanation.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies contiguity with 'Adjacent in time and location' and explains A and B take place in the same position, which matches the answer key's time and space requirement.
- Incorrect: The student mentions similarity but misinterprets it as 'scale' similarity rather than superficial resemblance between cause and effect as specified in the answer key.

Score: 0.8

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

First, the availability heuristic leads us to estimate the probability of an event based on how easily instances of it come to mind. Second, the negativity bias refers to our tendency to focus on negative emotional information. These two biases interact because moral outrage is typically presented in a negative way, prompting many individuals to actively seek out such content. Consequently, people tend to remember more examples of morally outraged material than neutral information.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias as our tendency to focus on negative emotional information and explains that moral outrage content is negative, prompting people to seek it out.
- Correct: The student accurately defines availability heuristic as estimating probability based on how easily instances come to mind, which matches the answer key definition.
- Correct: The student explains the interaction between the biases - negativity bias causes focus on moral outrage content, leading to more memorable examples, which through availability heuristic causes overestimation of frequency.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

Framework theories consist of broad understanding about what to anticipate in specific circumstances. When you associate an object with a negative stimulus, you develop a dislike for that object, which is known as evaluative conditioning. This concept is relevant to the personal domain because it involves your reasoning about your own moral intuitions, rather than the moral intuitions of others (moral domain) or the morality of behavior according to social norms (social domain).

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student discusses evaluative conditioning and personal/moral domains but fails to identify the key concept from the answer key: that biological contagion (the idea that contamination can spread through contact) is being incorrectly applied to social/psychological situations. The student doesn't mention biological domain concepts being misapplied to other domains.

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A delusional conspiracy is not embraced by culture, whereas a conspiracy theory that is not delusional can be culturally accepted (for example, the idea that Putin killed Prigozhin).

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student only addresses the cultural acceptance aspect but misses the crucial component that a delusional conspiracy theory must also be an irrational belief. The answer key requires both conditions: being irrational AND not commonly accepted.

Score: 0.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

Recognize patterns in random information, trust in supernatural events, embody masculinity.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'recognize patterns in random information' which corresponds to 'seeing patterns in randomness' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student mentions 'trust in supernatural events' which aligns with 'believing paranormal phenomena' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student states 'embody masculinity' which corresponds to 'being a man' from the answer key as a demographic factor associated with conspiratorial thinking.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Persistent impact. Misinformation often continues to affect our thinking even after it has been disproven. As a result, these false responses can hinder the learning process.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that incorrect information can persist and interfere with learning even after being corrected. While they use the term 'persistent impact' instead of the specific psychological mechanisms mentioned in the answer key (source amnesia, proactive interference, or continued-influence effect), their description of misinformation continuing to affect thinking after being disproven aligns well with the continued-influence effect concept from the answer key.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

Mere exposure occurs when politicians repeatedly say the same things to embed those statements into your memory. This process engages system 1 thinking, making it challenging to recognize a statement without also accepting it as true.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies mere exposure as the psychological mechanism and demonstrates understanding that repetition leads to familiarity and increased acceptance. While the explanation of the underlying process could be more precise, the core concept is accurately captured.

Score: 1.0

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

It helps individuals become more precise. When experiencing a depressive disorder, people often view the world from a more standard or realistic perspective.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that depression leads to more accurate/realistic predictions, which aligns with the key point that people with major depressive disorder are more accurate due to reduced optimistic bias. The answer captures the essence that depression provides a more realistic worldview.

Score: 1.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

As the reliability of sensory input diminishes, prior beliefs exert a greater influence on the resulting perception.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when sensory information becomes less reliable, prior beliefs have greater influence on perception, which directly matches the key concept in the answer key.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

Pre-conventional; prioritizes self-interest, concentrating on obtaining rewards and evading punishments. Conventional; emphasizes considering others' interests, aiming to be seen as good by following laws and social norms. Post-conventional; recognizes that moral values may conflict, focusing on universal ethical and moral principles.

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly describes pre-conventional level as focusing on self-interest, obtaining rewards and avoiding punishment, which aligns with the answer key's description of obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: Student accurately describes conventional level as emphasizing others' interests and following social norms/laws, which matches the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: Student correctly describes post-conventional level as focusing on universal ethical and moral principles, which aligns with the answer key's description of abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model suggests that we generate explanations for events that actually occurred, rather than for alternative outcomes that did not happen. This makes recalling what did happen easier, a concept known as cognitive fluency. As a result, the results of an event appear more foreseeable after the event has taken place.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a causal model involves generating explanations for events that occurred, which aligns with the concept of a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student accurately explains how causal models contribute to hindsight bias by making events appear more foreseeable after they occur, which corresponds to events seeming more inevitable than they actually were.

Score: 1.0

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Once a person knows the actual result of an event, it becomes challenging to ignore this knowledge when trying to recall previous estimates of its likelihood, a phenomenon known as the curse of knowledge. As a result, the event appears more foreseeable in hindsight.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly explains that newly learned information (knowing the actual result) cannot be avoided when estimating past likelihood judgments, making events seem more foreseeable in hindsight. They also correctly identify this as the curse of knowledge phenomenon.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing involves aiming to select the very best option, whereas satisficing means settling for an option that meets acceptable criteria. Individuals with high levels of neuroticism are more likely to use a maximizing approach when making decisions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as aiming to select the very best option, which aligns with the answer key's definition of trying to make the best choice.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as settling for an option that meets acceptable criteria, which matches the answer key's definition of making a good-enough choice.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that individuals with high neuroticism are more likely to use a maximizing approach, which directly matches the answer key.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

I would create a Quizlet-style set of cards, with the term on one side and a short definition on the other. First, you try to guess the definition, then flip the card to check the actual answer. You compare your guess with the correct definition, noting the differences, which encourages thoughtful reflection and engages your system 2 thinking. Once you get a card right, it’s marked as learned and appears less frequently. However, if your initial judgment about the definition is wrong, the card is shown more often, so through repeated exposure and the availability heuristic, you gradually reinforce the correct term-definition pairing in your memory.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement with the question by proposing a specific, well-thought-out solution (Quizlet-style flashcards) that addresses the core challenge of engaging many students with limited resources. They show understanding of cognitive principles by referencing system 2 thinking, spaced repetition, and the availability heuristic, and explain how their approach would work mechanistically to promote active learning while being scalable.
