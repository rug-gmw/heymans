## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidtâ€™s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

The social-intuitionist model suggests that system 1 thinking is employed when we are unable to provide logical explanations for a moral judgment, while system 2 thinking is engaged when we consciously reflect on a moral issue, such as during a moral conflict. Haidt argues that system 1 thinking tends to be more prevalent.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly describes System 1 as being employed 'when we are unable to provide logical explanations' rather than correctly identifying it as intuitive/emotional thinking that operates automatically in moral judgment.
- Incorrect: The student describes System 2 as conscious reflection during moral conflicts, but fails to clearly identify it as reasoning, rational thought, or deliberation as specified in the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly states that System 1 thinking 'tends to be more prevalent,' which aligns with the answer key's requirement that System 1 is more dominant.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

Representativeness heuristic refers to the tendency to assume that something belongs to a specific category simply because it resembles a typical example of that category, while ignoring the actual prevalence of that category.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process in this scenario.
- Correct: The student provides an accurate explanation of the representativeness heuristic, describing how we categorize based on resemblance to typical examples rather than considering base rates or actual prevalence.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

The anchoring effect describes how we tend to base our judgments on information we first encountered or learned. The primacy effect refers to the tendency to recall or be more influenced by the earliest information. In both cases, initial information impacts and biases our decision-making.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as basing judgments on first encountered information, which aligns with the answer key's description of taking the first piece of information as a starting point.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as the tendency to recall or be more influenced by earliest information, which matches the answer key's point about better remembering first information.
- Correct: The student clearly identifies that both effects involve initial information impacting and biasing decision-making, which corresponds to the answer key's point about overreliance on first information.

Score: 1.0

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion means we are more afraid of losing than we are motivated by gaining. Gains are seen as positive outcomes. Risk aversion refers to the preference for avoiding risks unless certain conditions are met.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly captures that loss aversion involves weighing losses more heavily than gains, expressing this as being 'more afraid of losing than motivated by gaining.'
- Incorrect: The student's definition of risk aversion as 'preference for avoiding risks unless certain conditions are met' is incomplete and doesn't capture the key concept of preferring certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 0.5

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias is a component of affective forecasting where we tend to exaggerate the emotional effect that a future event will have. In this case, individuals overpredict how deeply saddened they will be after ending a relationship.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as exaggerating the emotional effect of future events, which aligns with the answer key's definition of overestimating the impact of future events on our feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly explains that impact bias prevents breakups by causing people to overpredict how sad they will be after ending a relationship, which matches the answer key's point about overestimating how bad a breakup will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting refers to the strong impact our current emotions have on predicting our future feelings, especially regarding decisions. Impact bias means we often exaggerate how strongly we will feel emotions later, making end-of-life decisions less dependable since we can't accurately anticipate our feelings at that time.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes affective forecasting as the impact of current emotions on predicting future feelings, but the answer key defines it more simply as predictions about our own future emotional state, without emphasizing the influence of current emotions.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that affective forecasting makes end-of-life decisions problematic because we cannot accurately predict our future emotional states, which aligns with the answer key's point about healthy people potentially changing their preferences when actually sick.

Score: 0.5

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

People tend to undervalue small probabilities. Very rare events are often regarded as impossible, when in fact they are just unlikely.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student states people 'undervalue small probabilities' which contradicts the answer key that merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that very rare events are often regarded as impossible, which aligns with the answer key point about extremely low probabilities being interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 0.5

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion means that we experience losses as more distressing because they carry greater negative impact than the positive impact of equivalent gains.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion means losses have greater impact than equivalent gains, which reflects that negative utilities are weighted more heavily than positive utilities in prospect theory.

Score: 1.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory suggests that decisions are made by evaluating the monetary value of each possible result. Expected utility theory agrees with this but further explains that outcomes can have personal or subjective values, referred to as utilities.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory focuses on monetary values while expected utility theory incorporates subjective/personal values (utilities), which aligns with the distinction between financial and non-financial values.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention risk aversion or heuristics and biases as a key difference between the theories, focusing only on the subjective nature of utilities rather than behavioral considerations.

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesnâ€™t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

These models describe how people make decisions and evaluate options. Expected value theory suggests we look at the monetary result of each option and select the one with the highest value. Expected utility theory builds on this by recognizing that people assign personal value to outcomes. Multi-level attribute utility theory further expands this by acknowledging that outcomes have several different characteristics. Prospect theory enhances utility theory by incorporating the influence of mental shortcuts and cognitive biases.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as focusing on monetary outcomes and selecting the highest value option, which aligns with the normative model based on financial outcomes and probabilities.
- Correct: The student accurately describes expected utility theory as building on expected value theory by incorporating personal/subjective value to outcomes, matching the key concept of utility beyond just financial measures.
- Incorrect: The student refers to 'Multi-level attribute utility theory' instead of 'Multi-attribute utility theory' and doesn't mention the key concepts of weights and utilities for different attributes, though they do recognize multiple characteristics.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies prospect theory as enhancing utility theory by incorporating mental shortcuts and cognitive biases, which aligns with it being a descriptive/behavioral model that considers heuristics and biases.

Score: 0.75

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease peopleâ€™s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

When an outcome is framed as a loss, individuals tend to take more risks and are less cautious.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion leads people to take more risks when facing potential losses, demonstrating understanding that loss aversion can reduce risk aversion and make people risk-seeking in loss domains.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning is a learning process where we come to understand the connection between two events. In classical conditioning, a response happens after a stimulus, leading to the understanding that the stimulus signals the response. Operant conditioning involves learning based on the use of rewards and punishments.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as a learning process involving connections/associations between events, which aligns with the key concept of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of classical conditioning as learning stimulus-response connections, which captures the essence of learning associations when things happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies operant conditioning as learning through rewards and punishments, which matches the answer key's description of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation refers to a mistaken belief in a cause-and-effect connection, whereas illusory correlation involves a perceived association that does not imply causation.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly identifies that illusory causation involves mistaken causal beliefs, but incorrectly defines illusory correlation as a perceived association that doesn't imply causation. According to the answer key, illusory correlation is when correlation is perceived between variables that don't actually correlate at all, not about the absence of causation in real correlations.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to â€˜properlyâ€™ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

A script refers to the expected behavior in a particular situation, such as attending a birthday party, while a schema is a mental framework that represents a broader concept, like the healthcare system. Scripts are culturally specific schemas that guide routine events, whereas schemas encompass our overall understanding of various ideas or systems.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that understanding the Dutch healthcare system is a schema because it represents a broader mental framework for understanding a system, which aligns with the answer key's explanation that schemas correspond to knowledge and relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script because it refers to expected behavior in a particular situation, which matches the answer key's explanation that scripts describe how to behave in specific situations.

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

Behaviorists took a mechanistic approach because they focused solely on identifying the cause of behavior, without taking into account its purpose or inherent qualities.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that behaviorists adopted a mechanistic/physical stance by focusing on causal processes that link stimuli to behaviors, which aligns with the answer key's emphasis on processes causing stimulus-behavior relationships.

Score: 1.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

Evolutionary psychologists take a functional perspective because they focus on the purpose of specific behaviors instead of their mechanical or structural aspects.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that evolutionary psychologists adopt a functional perspective, which corresponds to the design stance in Dennett's framework. They accurately explain that this involves focusing on the purpose/function of behaviors rather than their mechanical aspects, demonstrating understanding of the key concept.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

One aspect is distinctiveness, which occurs if only A comes before B. Another is consistency, meaning B always follows A. Consensus refers to whether A and B are linked across various instances. Contiguity involves A and B occurring together in a reasonable time and place. The last factor is whether the connection is credible.

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies distinctiveness and explains it as 'only A comes before B', which matches the answer key's concept that B follows A but not other events.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies consistency and accurately explains it as 'B always follows A', which directly matches the answer key.
- Incorrect: Student mentions 'consensus' instead of plausibility. While consensus might relate to agreement across instances, it doesn't match the answer key's concept of common sense plausibility.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies contiguity and explains it as A and B occurring together in reasonable time and place, which matches the answer key's contiguity in time and space.
- Incorrect: Student mentions 'credible connection' which relates to plausibility but misses the answer key's fifth heuristic of similarity in cause and effect (superficial resemblance between A and B).

Score: 0.6

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Availability bias refers to the tendency to judge how often something occurs based solely on how easily examples come to mind. Negativity bias is the inclination to focus on and seek out negative emotional content, such as morally outraged material. Because we pay more attention to negative events, they are more readily recalled due to availability bias, leading us to overestimate how frequently they happen.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias as the tendency to focus on and seek out negative content, specifically mentioning morally outraged material, which aligns with the answer key's definition.
- Correct: The student accurately describes availability bias (they call it 'availability bias' rather than 'availability heuristic' but this is acceptable) as judging frequency based on how easily examples come to mind, matching the answer key's definition.
- Correct: The student clearly explains the connection between the two biases: negativity bias makes us pay more attention to negative events, which makes them more easily recalled, and availability bias then leads us to overestimate their frequency - this captures the essential mechanism described in the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

We use a framework based on broad areas of knowledge to understand how things function and apply this understanding to our everyday lives. For instance, we draw from the field of biology, recognizing that diseases and bacteria can be contagious.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that biological concepts of contagion (diseases and bacteria being contagious) are being applied to a non-biological domain (social/psychological preferences about objects), which matches the answer key's requirement to explain how biological domain concepts are incorrectly applied to other domains.

Score: 1.0

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

Non-delusional conspiracy theories are commonly accepted by many individuals within the same community and thus fit the social context, whereas delusional theories are believed by only a small number of people and are considered unsuitable.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that delusional conspiracy theories are not commonly accepted (believed by only a small number of people) while non-delusional ones are commonly accepted by many in the community. However, the answer doesn't explicitly mention the irrationality component, though it captures the key distinguishing factor of social acceptance.

Score: 1.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

Reduced critical thinking, favoring straightforward explanations for complicated situations, and self-centeredness.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student mentions 'reduced critical thinking' which directly corresponds to 'having a low level of analytical thinking' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student identifies 'favoring straightforward explanations for complicated situations' which matches 'believing in simple explanations for complex events' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student mentions 'self-centeredness' which corresponds to 'being narcissistic' from the answer key, as both terms describe excessive self-focus.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you donâ€™t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Hindsight bias occurs when we incorrectly believe that we knew the correct answers all along, even though we only discovered them afterward.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes hindsight bias, which is about retrospectively believing you knew something all along after learning the outcome. However, the question asks about how incorrect answers during self-quizzing can interfere with learning. The correct mechanism is source amnesia (forgetting that your answer was incorrect and mistaking it for correct) or proactive interference (initial incorrect answers interfering with later correct ones). Hindsight bias doesn't explain how incorrect quiz answers interfere with learning the material.

Score: 0.0

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

The mere exposure effect occurs when repeated exposure to something increases our familiarity with it, which in turn makes us more inclined to like it, similar to how we respond to politicians' messages.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the mere exposure effect as the psychological mechanism and accurately explains that repeated exposure increases familiarity, which leads to increased preference - exactly matching the answer key's explanation of mere exposure as the tendency to prefer familiar things.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Certainly.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student provided no substantive answer to the question about whether major depressive disorder affects accuracy in predicting negative events. A complete answer should indicate that people with MDD are more accurate due to reduced optimism bias.

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

When sensory information is unreliable, prior beliefs have a stronger impact, so in uncertain situations we rely more on our existing schemas, which can result in biased thinking.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when sensory information is unreliable, prior beliefs have a stronger impact on perception. The additional context about schemas and biased thinking, while not required, demonstrates understanding of the broader implications of this principle.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You donâ€™t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other peopleâ€™s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

At the Pre-conventional stage, children make decisions based on the consequences of punishments and rewards; at the conventional stage, people act morally by following societal rules; and at the post-conventional stage, individuals develop an understanding of justice.

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies that pre-conventional stage involves decision-making based on consequences of punishments and rewards, which aligns with the answer key's description of focusing on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: Student accurately describes the conventional stage as following societal rules, which matches the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies that post-conventional stage involves understanding of justice, which aligns with the answer key's description of focusing on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model represents how we establish a cause-and-effect link when we notice that an outcome following an event is connected to that event. This leads to hindsight bias because we often believe this new connection was obvious all along, ignoring our earlier incorrect assessments.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a causal model involves establishing cause-and-effect connections between events, which aligns with the key point about creating a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student accurately explains how causal models contribute to hindsight bias by making connections seem obvious in retrospect ('obvious all along'), which matches the key point about events seeming more inevitable than they actually were.

Score: 1.0

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

We discover the correct result when it is revealed, and this new understanding replaces our former mistaken belief. After learning the accurate information, it overrides our previous association and leads us to perceive that our original judgment was right.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student misunderstands the mechanism of hindsight bias. They suggest that learning correct information makes us think our original judgment was right, but hindsight bias actually involves the inability to ignore newly learned information when trying to recall what we previously thought, not a replacement of beliefs that makes us think we were originally correct.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing involves putting in great effort to find the best possible option among all available choices. Satisficing, on the other hand, means choosing an option that is considered satisfactory or adequate. Maximizing is linked to higher levels of the neuroticism personality trait.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as putting in great effort to find the best possible option, which aligns with 'trying to make the best choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as choosing an option that is satisfactory or adequate, which matches 'making a good-enough choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that maximizing is linked to higher levels of neuroticism, which corresponds to the answer key's point that high neuroticism leads to adopting the maximizing decision style.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

I would implement various nudges to gently encourage the student to interact with the course material, which would reduce the time I spend providing feedback since the students would be more motivated to perform well. For example, I could set a default requirement for students to include a section in their assignment reflecting on how the assignment went and how the tasks were divided.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement by providing a specific, practical approach using nudges to encourage student interaction with course material. They give a concrete example of reflection sections in assignments and address the constraint of limited time/resources by explaining how this approach reduces the need for personalized feedback while maintaining student engagement.
