## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

System 1 plays a bigger role in moral judgments because it operates on a deeper, subconscious level. People don’t need to consciously think to recognize that killing others is wrong. Therefore, System 1 handles straightforward moral issues effectively. In contrast, System 2 is involved in more complicated moral dilemmas, like deciding whether stealing an expensive medicine to help someone is wrong. While we understand that stealing is generally wrong, thoughtful consideration might lead us to see it as the more ethical option in certain situations.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student does not explicitly define System 1 as intuitions/emotions, only describing it as operating on a 'deeper, subconscious level' without using the key terminology.
- Incorrect: The student does not explicitly define System 2 as reasoning/rational thought/deliberation, only describing it as being involved in 'complicated moral dilemmas' and 'thoughtful consideration' without using the key terminology.
- Correct: The student clearly states that 'System 1 plays a bigger role in moral judgments' and emphasizes its dominance over System 2, which aligns with Haidt's model.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

Representativity bias causes you to believe that all individuals in a specific group fit the stereotypes you associate with that group, such as assuming all homeless people are aggressive or that all well-dressed individuals are models.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic (referred to as 'representativity bias'), which is the correct psychological concept underlying the assumption described in the question.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of how the heuristic works by explaining that it involves using stereotypes to make judgments about individuals, and provides a relevant example of assuming well-dressed individuals are models, which directly relates to the scenario in the question.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring involves establishing an initial price, which subconsciously ties the perceived value of an item to that amount. The primacy effect refers to the tendency for information presented first to be remembered more strongly. Both concepts are commonly applied in negotiations by introducing specific details early on.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as establishing an initial reference point (price) that influences perception, which aligns with the key concept of taking first information as a starting point.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as the tendency to remember information presented first more strongly, which matches the answer key definition.
- Correct: The student recognizes that both concepts involve the importance of information presented early/first, which demonstrates understanding of their common reliance on first information, though expressed in the context of negotiations.

Score: 1.0

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency to strongly prefer avoiding losses of what one already possesses. In contrast, risk aversion is the preference for avoiding uncertainty when a guaranteed outcome is available. For example, when given the choice between a coin toss with a chance to win 50 euros or a sure 25 euros, most people opt for the guaranteed amount.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies loss aversion as the tendency to strongly prefer avoiding losses of what one already possesses, which captures the essence of weighing losses more heavily than gains.
- Correct: The student accurately defines risk aversion as the preference for avoiding uncertainty when a guaranteed outcome is available, and provides a clear example demonstrating the preference for certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 1.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

This bias causes individuals to exaggerate how strongly they will feel in the future, potentially leading them to avoid ending relationships because they believe the emotional pain from a breakup will be too intense to handle.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that impact bias involves exaggerating how strongly one will feel in the future, which captures the essence of overestimating the impact of future events on feelings.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that impact bias prevents breakups because people believe the emotional pain will be too intense to handle, which aligns with overestimating how bad the breakup will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

This involves anticipating how one will feel in the future. It is significant in end-of-life decisions because these emotional forecasts are often inaccurate.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies affective forecasting as anticipating or predicting future emotional states, which matches the answer key's definition of 'predictions about our own future emotional state.'
- Correct: The student recognizes that affective forecasting is important in end-of-life decisions because these forecasts are often inaccurate, which aligns with the answer key's point about healthy people's predictions potentially differing from their actual preferences when sick.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

People often overrate the likelihood of rare events, especially when the probability is extremely low, such as 0.01%, compared to something like 10%.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that people overrate extremely low probabilities more than merely low probabilities, when the answer key indicates that merely low probabilities (like 10%) are overestimated while extremely low probabilities are treated as impossibilities.
- Incorrect: The student fails to mention that extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities, instead claiming they are overrated even more than merely low probabilities.

Score: 0.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion means that people prefer avoiding a loss more than achieving a gain, as this helps them avoid experiencing negative feelings.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly identifies the basic concept of loss aversion but fails to express it in terms of utility as required by the question. The answer does not mention that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities or that the value function is steeper for losses than gains.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

The expected value model adopts an economic perspective of the future, but it does not incorporate certain factors. In contrast, the utility model includes variables such as effort and emotion. The expected value model represents a normative or rational way of making future decisions, whereas the expected utility model offers a more descriptive approach.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions that utility model includes 'effort and emotion' but doesn't clearly distinguish between financial vs non-financial values as specified in the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student discusses normative vs descriptive approaches but doesn't mention risk aversion or heuristics and biases as key differences between the theories.

Score: 0.0

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

The normative choice model focuses on selecting the most rational and optimal decision. The prescriptive choice model assists individuals in making beneficial decisions. The descriptive choice model describes how people truly make decisions, taking into account cognitive biases. The expected utility model uses utility as an outcome metric to evaluate more complex decisions compared to the value model.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: Student describes a 'normative choice model' in general terms but does not identify Expected Value Theory specifically or explain its core concept of financial outcomes with probabilities.
- Incorrect: Student mentions an 'expected utility model' which relates to Expected Utility Theory, but fails to clearly explain that it extends expected value theory by using subjective utility instead of just financial outcomes.
- Incorrect: Student does not mention Multi-attribute Utility Theory at all, which involves multiple attributes each with utilities and weights.
- Incorrect: Student mentions a 'descriptive choice model' that considers cognitive biases, which loosely relates to Prospect Theory, but does not specifically identify Prospect Theory or explain how it differs from expected utility theory.

Score: 0.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Loss aversion varies depending on the individual. For one person, 100 euros might be a significant amount they are unwilling to risk, leading them to avoid taking risks. However, for someone else, 100 euros may not be much, making them less hesitant to take risks with that money.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student confuses loss aversion with individual differences in risk tolerance based on wealth levels. They fail to address the key concept that loss aversion can make people risk-seeking when trying to avoid losses, instead discussing how different people have different risk tolerances for the same amount of money.

Score: 0.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning is a process that shapes behavior by encouraging specific desirable actions. Classical conditioning involves an animal associating one event with another, such as a dog hearing a bell and then salivating because it associates the bell with food. Operant conditioning involves learning that a certain behavior leads to a consequence, like a dog receiving a reward or punishment based on its actions.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes conditioning as 'shaping behavior by encouraging specific desirable actions' which is too narrow and focuses only on desirable behaviors, missing the key concept that conditioning is about learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student correctly explains classical conditioning as associating one event with another and provides an appropriate example of a dog associating a bell with food, which demonstrates understanding of temporal/spatial associations.
- Correct: The student accurately describes operant conditioning as learning that behavior leads to consequences and mentions both rewards and punishments, which aligns with the concept of actions causing rewards or punishments.

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation occurs when two variables frequently appear together, leading to the incorrect belief that one causes the other. Illusory correlation refers to two variables that might occur simultaneously but are actually unrelated, and they can often happen independently without your awareness.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly distinguishes between illusory causation (incorrectly inferring causation from correlation) and illusory correlation (perceiving correlation where none exists). While the wording differs from the answer key, the core concepts are accurately captured - illusory causation involves misinterpreting an actual correlation as causal, while illusory correlation involves perceiving a relationship between unrelated variables.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

Understanding how the healthcare system functions is a schema, while knowing the appropriate way to act at a party is a script, since there are specific acceptable behaviors to follow in that setting. The knowledge of healthcare is more of a broad understanding of how something operates, without predetermined actions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that understanding the Dutch healthcare system is a schema and provides a reasonable explanation that it involves 'broad understanding of how something operates' which aligns with schemas being knowledge structures about relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script and explains this is because there are 'specific acceptable behaviors to follow in that setting,' which accurately captures that scripts are behavioral sequences for specific situations.

Score: 1.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

They took a mechanical approach because behaviorists think people act automatically to achieve specific outcomes, similar to machines.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies behaviorists as taking a 'mechanical approach' rather than the physical stance. While they show some understanding that behaviorists viewed behavior as automatic responses, they mischaracterize the stance and don't demonstrate understanding of Dennett's specific terminology or that behaviorists focused on stimulus-response processes rather than goal-directed outcomes.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

The design stance, since evolution focuses on the development of humans, suggests that behaviors are probably shaped as a result of evolutionary design.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the design stance and provides a reasonable explanation that evolutionary psychology views behaviors as shaped by evolutionary design, which aligns with the functional perspective mentioned in the answer key.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Temporal occurrence (B happens whenever A occurs), directionality (A always precedes B), covariance (A and B always occur simultaneously), spatial and temporal proximity (B must happen near A in time and place, since, for example, leaving the heater on in winter doesn't cause ice to melt in summer), consistency (B reliably happens whenever A occurs).

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions 'covariance' and 'temporal occurrence' but does not identify distinctness/specificity - that B follows A but not other events.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies consistency as 'B reliably happens whenever A occurs', which matches the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention plausibility or common sense as a heuristic for judging causation.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies spatial and temporal proximity with a good example about the heater and ice melting.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention similarity in cause and effect as a heuristic for judging causation.

Score: 0.4

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Availability bias is the tendency to believe that things that are easier to remember are more accurate than those that are harder to recall. People with specific values tend to receive recommendations aligned with their preferences, increasing the likelihood that they accept these as truth. Additionally, individuals often look for information that supports their existing beliefs rather than evidence that challenges them, which is known as confirmation bias.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions 'availability bias' but provides an incorrect definition focused on accuracy rather than frequency estimation, and doesn't explain how it relates to overestimating moral outrage on social media.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention negativity bias at all, which is one of the two primary biases identified in the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student does not explain the connection between the two biases and how they work together to cause overestimation of moral outrage on social media. Instead, they discuss confirmation bias and algorithmic recommendations, which are not part of the answer key.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

This is an illogical reaction likely stemming from representativeness bias, where someone assumes that because Person A is bad, everything associated with them must also be bad.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly identifies this as an illogical reaction but explains it using representativeness bias rather than framework theories and domain transfer. The answer key requires explaining this as biological contagion concepts being incorrectly applied to social/psychological domains, which the student does not address.

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A delusional conspiracy lacks a foundation of logical facts and reasoning, whereas a non-delusional conspiracy can be based on logic and evidence.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student focuses on logical foundation and evidence as the distinguishing factor, but misses the key criterion from the answer key that a conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both irrational AND not commonly accepted. The student's answer only addresses the irrationality aspect but omits the social acceptance component that is essential to the definition.

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

Lack of openness, limited critical thinking, and the presence of confirmation and other biases.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: While 'lack of openness' relates to personality factors, it is not specifically mentioned in the answer key. The answer key includes specific factors like narcissism, being male, low intelligence, and low analytical thinking.
- Correct: 'Limited critical thinking' corresponds to 'having a low level of analytical thinking' from the answer key, which is a recognized cognitive factor contributing to conspiratorial thinking.
- Incorrect: 'Confirmation and other biases' is too general and vague. While biases may relate to conspiratorial thinking, the answer key specifies particular cognitive biases like seeing patterns in randomness and attributing agency where it doesn't exist.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Due to outcome bias, when you see the right answer, you might think, "That's what I intended," and as a result, you may not realize the need to revise your original response.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes outcome bias and hindsight bias rather than the correct mechanisms. The answer key requires source amnesia (forgetting the source of incorrect information), proactive interference (old incorrect info interfering with new correct info), or continued-influence effect. Outcome bias is about judging decisions based on outcomes rather than the decision process, which doesn't match the memory interference mechanisms described in the answer key.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

According to the learning principle, after hearing a message repeatedly over time, people are able to remember it easily and therefore tend to believe it is true.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes a memory-based mechanism but fails to identify the specific psychological concept. The answer key requires identification of 'mere exposure effect' (preference for familiar things) or 'illusory-truth effect' (repeated statements seem more truthful). The student's description of 'learning principle' is too vague and doesn't demonstrate knowledge of these established psychological phenomena.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Yes, this phenomenon is known as negativity bias.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that major depressive disorder makes people less accurate at predictions and misidentifies this as 'negativity bias.' The correct answer is that people with depression are actually more accurate because they lack the optimistic bias that non-depressed people have.

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

They continue to exist.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The answer 'They continue to exist' does not address what happens to the influence of prior beliefs when sensory reliability decreases. It fails to explain that prior beliefs have increased influence on perception when sensory information is unreliable.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

Pre-conventional: understanding right and wrong based on rewards or punishments. Conventional: recognizing right and wrong by following the values of your community. Post-conventional: applying advanced moral thinking and considering a broader perspective on ethics.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the pre-conventional level as being based on rewards or punishments, which aligns with the answer key's description of obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as following community values, which corresponds to the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the post-conventional level as involving advanced moral thinking and broader ethical perspectives, which matches the answer key's description of focusing on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model is one that describes cause-and-effect relationships, such as A causing B. After an event, people often attribute causation even when chance might have been involved. This can lead to the belief that A caused B, despite the possibility of other explanations. Simply because A occurred before B does not necessarily mean that A caused B.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes causal models in general terms as cause-and-effect relationships, but fails to specifically define them as coherent narratives of how past events are related, which is the key concept from the answer key.
- Incorrect: While the student mentions post-hoc attribution of causation, they do not explain how causal models make events seem more inevitable than they actually were, which is the specific mechanism by which causal models contribute to hindsight bias.

Score: 0.0

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

A person might consider numerous potential results before an event occurs. Once the outcome is revealed, they may instantly recall having anticipated that specific result, which reinforces the belief that they accurately predicted it.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes a mechanism of selective memory retrieval after an outcome is known, but misses the key point that hindsight bias occurs because newly learned information (the actual outcome) cannot be ignored when trying to recall past likelihood judgments. The answer doesn't address how learning the outcome interferes with accurately remembering previous probability estimates.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing involves striving to always make the very best decisions, while satisficing means choosing options that are satisfactory or adequate. Individuals with high levels of neuroticism tend to be more inclined to maximize.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as striving to make the very best decisions, which aligns with the answer key's definition of trying to make the best choice.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as choosing options that are satisfactory or adequate, which matches the answer key's definition of making a good-enough choice.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that individuals with high neuroticism tend to maximize, which directly corresponds to the answer key's statement about high neuroticism being associated with the maximizing decision style.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

I would require assignments that involve actively finding examples of biases in real-world sources like newspapers and articles. This approach helps students become more aware of everyday biases rather than just studying them theoretically. The assignments would be graded by AI on a pass/fail basis, allowing students to practice while reducing the teacher's grading workload. Additionally, I would share the best submissions on Brightspace for other students to learn from.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement by proposing a concrete, practical solution that addresses the key constraints. They suggest using real-world bias identification assignments with AI-assisted grading to maintain active learning while managing time limitations, and include a peer learning component through sharing exemplary work. This shows thoughtful consideration of both pedagogical goals and resource constraints.
