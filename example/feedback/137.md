## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidtâ€™s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

This model suggests that when faced with a moral dilemma, our initial reaction is emotional, driven by System 1. After making a decision based on these emotions, we then use System 2 to rationalize and find reasons to support our choice. In this framework, System 1 is the more dominant system.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 is emotional/intuitive, stating that 'our initial reaction is emotional, driven by System 1.'
- Correct: The student correctly identifies System 2's role in reasoning, explaining that 'we then use System 2 to rationalize and find reasons to support our choice.'
- Correct: The student correctly states that 'System 1 is the more dominant system' in Haidt's model.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

This is the representativeness heuristic, which suggests that event "a" is considered more likely than event "b" if the features of the stimulus resemble "a" more closely. This heuristic is what underlies the formation of stereotypes.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying mechanism for this assumption.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that the representativeness heuristic involves judging likelihood based on how much features resemble a category, which matches the answer key's explanation about estimating likelihood based on resemblance to stereotypes.

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring refers to the tendency to rely heavily on initial information provided and make limited adjustments based on it when responding to questions. The primacy effect is the phenomenon where individuals tend to remember the first stimulus presented better than any subsequent ones. Although it may occur without conscious awareness, it can still influence people's perceptions and future responses. Similarly, this effect can manifest in different forms or scales beyond just the answer given. The key similarity between the two is that they both occur at the beginning of an activity or task and subsequently impact people's reasoning.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as relying heavily on initial information, which aligns with the answer key's definition of taking the first piece of information as the starting point.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as remembering the first stimulus better than subsequent ones, which matches the answer key's definition of better remembering the first piece of information.
- Correct: The student identifies that both effects occur at the beginning and impact reasoning, which captures the essence of overreliance on first information, though expressed in slightly different terms than the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion is the fear of losing something we currently possess or expect to have, while risk aversion is the reluctance to take actions that might threaten our current situation, even if no tangible loss is involved.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes loss aversion as 'fear of losing something we currently possess' but misses the key concept that losses are weighted more heavily than equivalent gains. The answer doesn't capture the asymmetric valuation between losses and gains.
- Incorrect: The student describes risk aversion as 'reluctance to take actions that might threaten our current situation' but fails to identify the core concept of preferring certainty over uncertainty. The answer conflates risk aversion with status quo bias rather than addressing the certainty vs. uncertainty preference.

Score: 0.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias refers to the tendency to overpredict how much future events will affect our emotions and mental state. This bias can make it hard for us to end certain relationships because we believe we will feel extremely sad or depressed for a long time afterward and that recovering will be challenging.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies impact bias as the tendency to overpredict how much future events will affect our emotions, which aligns with the answer key's definition of overestimating the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that impact bias prevents breakups because people believe they will feel extremely sad for a long time, which matches the answer key's point about overestimating how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves predicting future choices based on our present mental and emotional conditions. This plays a significant role in end-of-life decisions, as people often believe in the early stages of illness that they would rather die than endure severe illness. However, research shows that when faced with the actual situation, individuals often feel better than they anticipated and may no longer fully agree with their previous decisions. This is particularly crucial for patients who are unable to communicate.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies affective forecasting as predicting future emotional/mental states, which aligns with the answer key's definition of predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that healthy people may predict preferring death when sick, but when actually sick they may feel better than anticipated and change their preferences, which matches the answer key's second point.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

This theory suggests that individuals often overrate low probabilities. There is a distinction between low and very low probabilities, with people generally overestimating low probabilities to a greater extent. However, when it comes to extremely low probabilities, they tend to adopt a more realistic perspective.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people overestimate low probabilities according to prospect theory, which aligns with the answer key's first point.
- Incorrect: The student states that people adopt a 'more realistic perspective' for extremely low probabilities, but fails to mention the key insight that extremely low probabilities are often treated as impossibilities rather than being realistically assessed.

Score: 0.5

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion shows how we tend to exaggerate the likelihood of rare events.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student confuses loss aversion with probability weighting. Loss aversion refers to the asymmetric value function where losses are weighted more heavily than equivalent gains, not to the overweighting of rare events which is a separate feature of prospect theory.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

One difference is that expected value theory involves decisions between options with varying monetary values, while expected utility theory allows choices between options of equal value, which do not necessarily have to be monetary. Another distinction is that expected utility theory takes into account the usefulness or satisfaction derived from the options, whereas expected value theory does not consider this aspect.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory deals with monetary values while expected utility theory extends beyond just financial considerations to include non-monetary values and satisfaction.
- Correct: The student accurately captures that expected utility theory incorporates utility/satisfaction (which relates to risk preferences and subjective valuation), while expected value theory does not account for these psychological factors.

Score: 1.0

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesnâ€™t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Score: 0.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease peopleâ€™s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

When facing risks that could result in losing something they currently possess or intend to acquire, individuals typically choose to avoid such gambles to protect their assets and ensure they attain their goals.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes risk aversion behavior when facing potential losses, which is the opposite of what the answer key requires. The key point is that loss aversion makes people willing to accept risk to avoid losses (risk seeking), but the student argues people avoid risks to protect against losses (risk averse).

Score: 0.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning is the process through which individuals learn to connect different events. Operant conditioning involves anticipating that event "a" will be followed by a reward or a punishment. In contrast, classical conditioning involves expecting that event "a" will be followed by event "b," but this connection is not necessarily linked to any reward or punishment.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as learning connections/associations between events, which aligns with the answer key's definition of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as expecting one event to be followed by another without necessarily involving rewards or punishments, which matches the key concept of learning associations when things happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as anticipating rewards or punishments following actions/events, which aligns with the answer key's definition of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

The distinction is that illusory causation occurs when we believe that event "a" causes event "b," whereas illusory correlation involves the perception that event "a" and event "b" happen simultaneously, without implying a causal relationship.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly defines illusory correlation as perceiving events happening simultaneously without causal relationship. The correct definition is that illusory correlation is perceiving a correlation between variables that do not actually correlate. The student's definition confuses correlation with mere co-occurrence or simultaneity.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to â€˜properlyâ€™ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

The birthday party scenario represents a script, as scripts are social understandings of typical routines and events that can vary across cultures and are acquired through observation. In contrast, the healthcare system is considered a schema because it encompasses knowledge that Dutch people are generally expected to have and take for granted when interacting with the system, also learned through observation. However, this type of knowledge is not necessarily limited to social contexts and tends to be broader.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the healthcare system as a schema and provides a reasonable explanation that it encompasses knowledge that people are expected to have, which aligns with the answer key's description of schemas as knowledge and relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the birthday party scenario as a script and provides a good explanation that scripts are social understandings of typical routines and events, which matches the answer key's description of scripts as social schemas describing behavior in specific situations.

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

Behaviorists take a mechanical approach because their goal is to explain how structures are built to function in this manner.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies behaviorists as taking a 'mechanical approach' rather than the physical stance. Additionally, the explanation about 'how structures are built to function' misses the key point that behaviorists focused on stimulus-response processes and rejected studying internal mental states because they couldn't be directly observed or measured.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

Evolutionary psychologists take the design stance because their primary aim is to understand the purpose, or in other words, why these psychological processes are beneficial to us as humans.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance and provides an accurate explanation that they focus on understanding the purpose/function of psychological processes, which aligns with the answer key's emphasis on considering processes in terms of their function.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Consistency: the stimulus produces the same effect repeatedly over time. Distinctiveness: this effect occurs exclusively with this specific stimulus. Congruence: the effect is not experienced by everyone. Counterfactual reasoning: we often consider what might have happened if the event had not taken place. Plausibility: it must be believable that such an event could actually occur.

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies consistency as the stimulus producing the same effect repeatedly, which matches the answer key's definition that B always follows A.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies distinctiveness as the effect occurring exclusively with the specific stimulus, which aligns with the answer key's concept that B follows A but not other events.
- Incorrect: Student mentions 'congruence' about individual differences, which does not correspond to any of the five heuristics in the answer key (contiguity in time and space is missing).
- Incorrect: Student discusses counterfactual reasoning, which is not one of the five heuristics in the answer key. The missing heuristic is similarity in cause and effect.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies plausibility as the event being believable, which matches the answer key's definition of common sense making it plausible that A causes B.

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

The availability heuristic involves perceiving an event as more likely because it is easier to remember or comes to mind quickly. Confirmation bias refers to the tendency to seek out information that supports our existing beliefs while ignoring evidence that contradicts them. Overestimating occurs because morally outraged content is widely circulated, making it more visible and easier to recall (availability heuristic). This leads us to believe that many people are morally outraged. As this type of content repeatedly appears in our feeds, we assume our view is accurate since we lack evidence to the contrary (confirmation bias).

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly identifies the availability heuristic but incorrectly identifies confirmation bias instead of the negativity bias as the second contributing factor.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the availability heuristic as estimating likelihood based on ease of recall and how easily examples come to mind.
- Correct: The student correctly explains how the two biases work together to cause overestimation, showing understanding of the mechanism even though one bias was misidentified.

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A delusional conspiracy theory is neither accepted by society nor commonly believed, whereas a non-delusional one is socially accepted and widely embraced.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student only addresses the 'commonly accepted' criterion but omits the crucial 'irrational belief' component. The answer key requires both conditions: being an irrational belief AND not commonly accepted for a theory to be considered delusional.

Score: 0.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

Identifying as a man, experiencing a sense of exclusion from society, lacking information, and missing critical thinking skills.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'identifying as a man' which corresponds to 'being a man' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student mentions 'missing critical thinking skills' which aligns with 'having a low level of analytical thinking' from the answer key.
- Incorrect: While the student mentions 'experiencing a sense of exclusion from society' and 'lacking information', these do not match any of the specific cognitive and personality factors listed in the answer key.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you donâ€™t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Due to memory, we often forget new information and only retain the incorrect details, even when we are open to revising our judgment.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions forgetting new information and retaining incorrect details, which touches on some relevant concepts, but fails to identify the specific psychological mechanism. The answer does not mention source amnesia, proactive interference, or the continued-influence effect, and lacks the key insight that people may forget the source of information and mistake their incorrect answer for the correct one.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

Through confirmation bias, as well as the primacy and recency effects.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions confirmation bias, primacy effect, and recency effect, but none of these are the correct psychological mechanisms. The answer key specifically looks for 'mere exposure' (the tendency to prefer familiar things) or the 'illusory-truth effect' as the mechanism by which repetition makes messages more attractive.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Individuals with major depressive disorder tend to be better at estimating the likelihood of negative events. This happens because those without the disorder usually have an optimistic bias, believing that adverse outcomes are less probable for them. In contrast, people with major depressive disorder have a more pessimistic outlook, which offsets this bias and leads to more accurate predictions of such events.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people with major depressive disorder are more accurate at predicting negative events and explains this is due to reduced optimistic bias compared to non-depressed individuals. The answer demonstrates understanding that depression leads to more realistic (rather than overly optimistic) assessments of risk.

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

As sensory information becomes less reliable, prior beliefs tend to play a more significant role in shaping perception. Consequently, our perception is more likely to conform to these prior beliefs compared to when the sensory information was more dependable.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when sensory information becomes less reliable, prior beliefs play a more significant role in shaping perception, and that perception becomes more influenced by expectations rather than sensory input. This directly matches the key concept from the answer key.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You donâ€™t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other peopleâ€™s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

According to Kohlberg, the stages of moral development are: Pre-conventional, where individuals aim to avoid punishment and gain rewards through good behavior; Conventional, which involves respecting others' feelings and maintaining societal order by adhering to rules; and Post-conventional, which transcends laws and reflects a deeper understanding of justice focused on protecting fundamental rights such as life and freedom.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the Pre-conventional level and accurately describes it as focusing on avoiding punishment and gaining rewards, which matches the answer key's description of obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the Conventional level and provides an accurate description that includes respecting others' feelings and maintaining societal order through rules, which aligns with the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the Post-conventional level and describes it as transcending laws with a focus on justice and fundamental rights like life and freedom, which demonstrates understanding of abstract principles and values as required by the answer key.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

The causal model of past events involves attempting to identify how one event may have led to another. This occurs through a sense-making process where explanations are formed to fit the outcome. This contributes to hindsight bias because once the outcome is known, we create reasons for it, leading us to believe we always knew it would happen and that it was inevitable (creeping determinism).

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a causal model involves connecting events and forming explanations through a sense-making process, which aligns with the concept of creating a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student accurately explains how causal models contribute to hindsight bias by making outcomes seem inevitable after the fact, and even mentions the specific term 'creeping determinism' which demonstrates understanding of how events appear more inevitable than they were.

Score: 1.0

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

This is a viewpoint used in cognitive theories, specifically the causal model grounded in the hypothetical paradigm. According to this paradigm, after we know the outcome, we are inclined to attribute our response to the event that is nearest to that outcome.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's answer describes attribution theory and causal reasoning but does not address the key mechanism of hindsight bias related to learning - that newly acquired information cannot be ignored when trying to recall past likelihood judgments. The answer focuses on attributing responses to proximate events rather than the inability to separate old knowledge from new knowledge.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing decision style occurs when individuals strive to select the best possible option, whereas satisficing decision style occurs when individuals settle for an option that is simply good enough. People who have high levels of neuroticism are more likely to use the maximizing decision style.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as striving to select the best possible option, which aligns with the answer key's definition of trying to make the best choice.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as settling for an option that is simply good enough, which matches the answer key's definition of making a good-enough choice.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people with high neuroticism are more likely to use the maximizing decision style, which directly matches the answer key.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

First, I would apply operant conditioning to help students link attending class with a positive experience. For instance, attending class could earn them an additional 0.2 points on the exam. Additionally, I would use the availability heuristic by mentioning recent events that might appeal to young people, such as a concert held by a popular artist in Groningen.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement by applying specific psychological concepts (operant conditioning and availability heuristic) to address the practical challenge of student engagement with limited resources. The examples are concrete and relevant, showing thoughtful consideration of how to motivate students efficiently.
