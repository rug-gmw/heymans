Grade: 6.0

## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

According to Haidt, a situation triggers a moral intuition that precedes and leads to a moral judgment. This intuition occurs before the judgment and, being intuitive, emotional, and subjective, is primarily driven by system 1. Once the emotional intuition and judgment have formed, reasoning—which is linked to system 2—can modify or override these initial responses through logical thinking. In this model, system 1 is initially more dominant because the intuitive reaction is rooted in that system.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 thinking involves intuitions and emotions, describing moral intuition as 'intuitive, emotional, and subjective' and 'primarily driven by system 1.'
- Correct: The student accurately describes System 2 thinking as reasoning, stating that 'reasoning—which is linked to system 2—can modify or override these initial responses through logical thinking.'
- Correct: The student correctly identifies System 1 as more dominant, explaining that 'system 1 is initially more dominant because the intuitive reaction is rooted in that system' and that intuition 'precedes and leads to a moral judgment.'

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

This is an ideal illustration of the representativeness heuristic, where individuals assess someone based on how closely they match a particular stereotype or prototype they hold. In doing this, they ignore the true likelihood of that person being part of the group or possessing those characteristics.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process in this scenario.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of the heuristic by explaining that it involves assessing someone based on how closely they match a stereotype or prototype, which aligns with the answer key's explanation about estimating likelihood based on resemblance to stereotypes.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

The anchoring effect describes how the initial stimulus establishes a reference point against which subsequent information is evaluated. The primacy effect means that information encountered first influences decisions more strongly than information presented afterward. Both effects share the idea that the first piece of information creates baseline expectations.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as establishing a reference point from initial information, which aligns with the answer key's description of taking the first piece of information as a starting point.
- Incorrect: The student describes primacy effect as first information influencing decisions more strongly, but the answer key specifically refers to better remembering first information, which is about memory rather than decision influence.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both effects involve overreliance on first information, expressed as 'first piece of information creates baseline expectations' which matches the answer key's concept of overreliance on first information.

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency to perceive losses as more significant than equivalent gains, whereas risk aversion is the inclination to steer clear of taking risks, except when individuals believe they fully understand the risk or when the risk is presented as a potential loss, such as the idea that avoiding risk X will result in losing Y.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves perceiving losses as more significant than equivalent gains, which matches the answer key's definition of weighing losses more heavily than gains.
- Incorrect: The student defines risk aversion as avoiding risks with exceptions based on understanding or framing, which is more complex than the answer key's definition of preferring certainty over uncertainty. The student's definition introduces additional concepts not present in the key answer.

Score: 0.5

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias is a mental shortcut where individuals exaggerate the intensity and duration of their future emotions, which can sometimes stop them from ending relationships because they anticipate prolonged and intense feelings, leading to increased anxiety that discourages breaking up.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies impact bias as overestimating future emotional responses, specifically mentioning both intensity and duration of emotions, which aligns with the key concept of overestimating the impact of future events on feelings.
- Correct: The student accurately explains how impact bias prevents breakups by describing how people anticipate prolonged and intense negative feelings, which creates anxiety that discourages them from breaking up - this matches the answer key's point about overestimating how bad a breakup will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective Forecasting refers to our capacity to anticipate how we will feel emotionally in the future. We often exaggerate both the intensity and duration of our future emotional reactions. In the context of end-of-life choices, this means we might overpredict how negatively we would feel following a distressing event, which could lead us to be more inclined to issue medical directives, such as refusing resuscitation.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines affective forecasting as our capacity to anticipate future emotional states, which aligns with the answer key's definition of predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of the key concept by explaining that healthy people might overpredict negative emotions and make medical directives accordingly, which captures the essence of how current predictions may not match actual future preferences when circumstances change.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

Prospect theory suggests that individuals view very low probabilities (such as less than 0.1%) as impossible and very high probabilities (over 95%) as certain. Additionally, people generally overestimate the likelihood of low-probability events but underestimate those with moderate to high probabilities. In this case, estimates vary greatly between a low probability of 10% and an extremely low probability of 0.01% because, per prospect theory, people tend to overrate the chance of the 10% event occurring while considering the extremely low probability event as impossible.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly states that people 'overestimate the likelihood of low-probability events' and specifically mentions that people 'tend to overrate the chance of the 10% event occurring,' which aligns with the answer key point about merely low probabilities being overestimated.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that people 'view very low probabilities (such as less than 0.1%) as impossible' and that they consider 'the extremely low probability event as impossible,' which matches the answer key point about extremely low probabilities being interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Losses are viewed as more harmful and therefore carry a negative value. While equal gains are seen as positive and have a positive value, the overall positive feeling from these gains is weaker than the negative feeling caused by losses. Due to the greater emotional impact of losses compared to equal gains in loss aversion, the overall value of a fair gamble is negative.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that losses carry greater weight than equivalent gains, explaining that negative feelings from losses are stronger than positive feelings from equal gains. This demonstrates understanding that the utility function is asymmetric with steeper weighting for losses, which is the core concept of loss aversion in prospect theory.

Score: 1.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory focuses on financial results, whereas expected utility theory also takes into account the utility of non-financial outcomes.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory deals with financial values while expected utility theory encompasses non-financial values/outcomes, which matches the first key point.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention the second key difference regarding heuristics/biases and risk aversion - they only provided one of the two required differences.

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

- Multiple Attribute Utility Theory evaluates utility by considering both the value of different attributes and their perceived importance.  
- Expected Value Theory centers on calculating financial or economic outcomes.  
- Expected Utility Theory focuses on the utility of an outcome combined with the probability of its occurrence.  
- Prospect Theory builds on the Expected Utility Model by including heuristics and biases in decision-making.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies Expected Value Theory as focusing on financial/economic outcomes, which aligns with the answer key's description of financial outcomes with probabilities.
- Correct: The student accurately describes Expected Utility Theory as focusing on utility of outcomes with probabilities, matching the answer key's explanation that it's like expected value theory but with subjective utility rather than just financial outcomes.
- Correct: The student correctly explains Multi-Attribute Utility Theory as evaluating utility through different attributes and their importance/weights, which matches the answer key's description of multiple attributes with utilities and weights.
- Correct: The student accurately describes Prospect Theory as building on Expected Utility Theory while incorporating heuristics and biases, which aligns with the answer key's description of it being a descriptive model similar to expected utility theory but considering heuristics and biases.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Loss aversion is a cognitive bias where individuals feel the impact of losses more strongly than that of equivalent gains. This often causes people to avoid taking risks, preferring to forgo the opportunity to gain a larger amount in order to avoid the possibility of losing a smaller sum, even when the overall bet has a positive expected value, indicating a likely profit over time.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly defines loss aversion but incorrectly concludes that it makes people more risk averse. The answer key indicates that loss aversion can actually decrease risk aversion and make people risk-seeking when facing potential losses, which the student does not address.

Score: 0.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves learning by making connections. In classical conditioning, individuals or animals come to link a stimulus with a particular reaction, whereas operant conditioning involves reinforcing wanted behaviors and discouraging unwanted ones through rewards and punishments.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as involving learning connections/associations, which aligns with the key concept of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as linking a stimulus with a reaction, which captures the essence of learning to associate things that happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as involving rewards and punishments to reinforce or discourage behaviors, which matches the key point about learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation occurs when individuals believe that one event causes another simply because they occur simultaneously or sequentially, despite no real connection. Illusory correlation happens when people assume there is a link between two things when, in fact, no such association exists.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly distinguishes between illusory causation (incorrectly assuming causation when events occur together) and illusory correlation (perceiving a correlation that doesn't actually exist). While the wording differs from the answer key, the core concepts are accurately captured - illusory causation involves misinterpreting relationships as causal, while illusory correlation involves perceiving non-existent correlations.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

The Dutch healthcare system operates according to a schema, whereas the expected conduct at a Dutch birthday party follows a script. A schema is a broad framework that describes how something functions, while a script is a more specific type of schema that provides a context-dependent (often social) set of guidelines or procedures.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that the Dutch healthcare system is a schema and provides an accurate explanation that a schema is a broad framework describing how something functions, which aligns with the answer key's emphasis on knowledge and relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that birthday party behavior follows a script and accurately explains that a script is a context-dependent social set of guidelines, which matches the answer key's definition of scripts as social schemas for specific situational behavior.

Score: 1.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

This represents the physical perspective since individuals concentrate more on the events themselves rather than the reasons behind them or the processes involved.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly identifies the physical stance but provides an incorrect explanation. They state that behaviorists focused on 'events themselves rather than the reasons behind them or the processes involved,' which contradicts the answer key that emphasizes behaviorists DID focus on the processes that caused stimuli to result in behaviors.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

This would represent the design perspective because individuals focus on the purpose and the advantages it offers.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the design stance and provides appropriate reasoning by mentioning 'purpose' and 'advantages,' which aligns with the functional approach that characterizes how evolutionary psychologists analyze psychological processes.

Score: 1.0

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Specificity means B occurs only after A. Consistency refers to B repeatedly following A across several attempts. Representativeness indicates that A and B share similarities. Contiguity in time and space assesses whether B happens shortly after A or if they occur near each other. Closeness in cause and effect considers if A and B have related causes and consequences.

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies specificity (equivalent to distinctness) and accurately explains that B occurs only after A, which matches the answer key's concept that B follows A but not other events.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies consistency and provides an accurate explanation that B repeatedly follows A across several attempts, which aligns with the answer key's definition that B always follows A.
- Incorrect: Student mentions 'representativeness' instead of 'plausibility' and describes it as A and B sharing similarities, which conflates it with the similarity heuristic rather than common sense plausibility.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies contiguity in time and space and provides an accurate explanation that B happens shortly after A or they occur near each other, matching the answer key.
- Incorrect: Student describes 'closeness in cause and effect' as related causes and consequences, but misses the key concept from the answer key that similarity refers to superficial resemblance between A and B themselves.

Score: 0.6

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

The Availability Heuristic occurs when we recall more examples or instances of morally outraged users or posts. Confirmation bias is a mental shortcut where we focus on information that supports our existing beliefs. In this context, it means we are more likely to notice or remember morally outraged posts or users because they align with our prior views, leading us to think of more such examples.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions availability heuristic correctly but does not identify negativity bias, instead incorrectly identifying confirmation bias as the second bias.
- Correct: The student correctly explains the availability heuristic as estimating frequency based on ease of recalling examples, though they don't use the exact definition from the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student attempts to explain the mechanism but incorrectly attributes it to confirmation bias rather than negativity bias, missing the key point that negativity bias causes us to attend to morally outraged content in the first place.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

Magical contagion is the mistaken belief that an object or person can influence another object or person even after being separated from them. Framework theories are broad, common-sense models often based on fields like math, physics, or biology, and people might incorrectly apply knowledge from areas such as chemistry—where interactions between substances can have lasting effects—to other contexts. However, this assumption is incorrect and cannot be universally applied.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that magical contagion involves the inappropriate application of concepts from one domain (specifically mentioning chemistry/substances having lasting effects) to other contexts where such effects don't actually occur. This demonstrates understanding that biological/chemical domain knowledge about contagion is being incorrectly applied to social/psychological domains.

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

Delusional conspiracies and non-delusional conspiracies can be differentiated based on the level of social agreement among the general public. If a large number of people believe in the conspiracy theory that Putin ordered the killing of the Wagner chief, it is not seen as delusional; however, if only a small group supports this idea, it is regarded as delusional.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student only identifies social acceptance as the distinguishing factor but fails to mention that a delusional conspiracy theory must also be an irrational belief. The answer key requires both criteria: being irrational AND not commonly accepted.

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

1. Confirmation bias (the tendency to look for information that supports our existing beliefs). 2. Availability heuristic (the more we encounter examples of conspiracy theories, the more likely we are to consider them). 3.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: Confirmation bias was not mentioned in the answer key as one of the specific cognitive and personality factors covered in the lecture.
- Incorrect: Availability heuristic was not mentioned in the answer key as one of the specific cognitive and personality factors covered in the lecture.
- Incorrect: The third point is incomplete - the student only wrote '3.' without providing any factor.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Hindsight bias may potentially disrupt this process. It refers to the tendency for people to believe they knew the outcome all along after discovering it. When only the correct answers are seen, individuals tend to overestimate how likely they were to have known them, which can hinder learning.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes hindsight bias, which is about overestimating one's prior knowledge after learning the correct answer. However, the question asks specifically about how incorrect answers interfere with learning. The answer key focuses on source amnesia (forgetting that your answer was incorrect) or proactive interference (incorrect answers interfering with correct ones), not on overestimating prior knowledge.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

One possible reason for this is confirmation bias, where individuals look for information that supports their existing views. When politicians repeatedly make the same statements, people are exposed to these opinions frequently, and if they align with their prior beliefs, they are more likely to support those politicians.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student identifies confirmation bias, which is about seeking information that confirms existing beliefs, rather than the correct answer of mere exposure effect or illusory-truth effect. While the student mentions repeated exposure, they don't identify the specific psychological mechanism where familiarity itself increases preference/believability regardless of prior beliefs.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Yes, individuals with major depressive disorder often exhibit a negativity bias, meaning they focus on negative emotions to reinforce their existing negative beliefs and are more likely to overestimate the likelihood of adverse events occurring to them.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that people with major depressive disorder overestimate the likelihood of adverse events, when the answer key indicates they are actually more accurate due to reduced optimism bias (not overestimating negative events but being less overly optimistic).

Score: 0.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

If the reliability of sensory information declines, our prior beliefs would become more generalized and less precise.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly describes what happens to prior beliefs themselves (becoming more generalized) rather than correctly explaining that prior beliefs have increased influence on perception when sensory information is unreliable.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

Kohlberg categorized moral development into three stages: 1. Pre-conventional level, where individuals act primarily out of self-interest unless a reciprocal benefit is involved. 2. Conventional level, in which people care mostly about others' judgments and the accepted moral standards of society. 3. Post-conventional level, the highest stage, where individuals prioritize universal ethical principles over others' opinions and recognize that moral values can sometimes clash.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the pre-conventional level and describes it as focused on self-interest, which aligns with the answer key's description of avoiding punishment or gaining rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as caring about others' judgments and accepted moral standards of society, which matches the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the post-conventional level and describes it as prioritizing universal ethical principles, which aligns with the answer key's description of focusing on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model of past events is based on the assumption that individuals often see past occurrences as more predictable than they actually were and underestimate the role that chance may have played in the result. This leads to hindsight bias because people commonly do not ignore new information when assessing previous choices, making them more inclined to view past events as predetermined or to assume a direct cause-and-effect relationship between actions and outcomes, even when the outcome might have been influenced by chance.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes effects and characteristics of causal models but does not define what a causal model actually is - a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student correctly explains how causal models contribute to hindsight bias by making past events seem more predictable/predetermined than they actually were, which aligns with the key point about inevitability.

Score: 0.5

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Hindsight bias is the inclination to believe, after an event has occurred, that one predicted or knew the outcome all along. People tend to recall the actual events rather than alternative possibilities and often overlook the impact of information obtained after the fact, which leads to this bias.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes what hindsight bias is but does not address how learning specifically contributes to it. The answer key requires explaining that when estimating past likelihood judgments, newly learned information cannot be avoided and gets incorporated, but the student doesn't mention this mechanism of how learning interferes with recalling past judgments.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing decision styles focus on finding the optimal choice, while satisficing decision styles seek an adequate or satisfactory option. Individuals with high levels of neuroticism are more inclined to use the maximizing approach.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as focusing on finding the optimal choice, which aligns with 'trying to make the best choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as seeking an adequate or satisfactory option, which matches 'making a good-enough choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that individuals with high neuroticism are more inclined to use the maximizing approach, which matches the answer key's statement.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

First, I would implement nudges that encourage students to participate in desired behaviors without restricting their freedom of choice. To achieve this, I would use social pressure by making their lack of engagement visible, for example, through a public form that tracks their involvement with the course material. If students fail to engage, they would be publicly identified, which may motivate them to become more active in the course. Additionally, I would make lectures more interactive and repeatedly reference common concepts across different sessions. This approach leverages the availability heuristic, as increased exposure to the information should help students remember it better. I would also provide practice questions where answers are given only after a delay, aiming to reduce the impact of hindsight bias. Finally,

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement with the question by applying multiple behavioral concepts from the course (nudges, social pressure, availability heuristic, hindsight bias) to the practical teaching scenario. They provide specific, actionable strategies like public tracking of engagement, interactive lectures, repeated concept references, and delayed practice question answers. The response shows thoughtful consideration of how to encourage student engagement within resource constraints, even though the answer appears incomplete.
