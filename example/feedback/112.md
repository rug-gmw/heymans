## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

According to the social-intuitionist model, system 1 thinking plays a crucial role in moral reasoning since our moral judgments are primarily driven by emotional intuitions. In contrast, system 2 is less influential, as it only comes into play in certain situations—like when we are motivated to engage in deliberate reasoning—and typically after an initial judgment has been formed. Therefore, system 1 holds greater dominance.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 thinking involves emotional intuitions, which aligns with the answer key's requirement to identify System 1 as intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student accurately describes System 2 as involving deliberate reasoning, which matches the answer key's identification of System 2 as reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student clearly states that 'system 1 holds greater dominance,' directly addressing the answer key requirement that System 1 thinking is more dominant than System 2.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

The representativeness heuristic occurs when we judge something as more likely to belong to a certain group or category because it closely resembles the typical example or prototype of that group.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive mechanism in this scenario.
- Correct: The student accurately explains the representativeness heuristic as judging likelihood of category membership based on resemblance to typical examples or prototypes, which matches the key concept of estimating likelihood based on stereotype resemblance.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring refers to the tendency for initial information to have a greater impact than information received afterward. In forming impressions, the initial characteristics you observe about someone have a stronger effect on your overall positive or negative view of that person than information you learn later, a phenomenon known as the primacy effect. Both concepts share the idea that early information carries more weight than subsequent information.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as the tendency for initial information to have greater impact, which aligns with the answer key's description of taking first information as a starting point.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as initial characteristics having stronger effect on impressions, which corresponds to the answer key's point about better remembering first information.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both concepts share the commonality that early/initial information carries more weight, which matches the answer key's point about overreliance on first information.

Score: 1.0

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency to feel the pain of losses more intensely than the pleasure of equivalent gains. Risk aversion involves a preference for avoiding risk. Unlike risk aversion, when faced with potential losses, people may actually take more risks to try to avoid losing.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves feeling losses more intensely than equivalent gains, which matches the answer key's definition of weighing losses more heavily than gains.
- Incorrect: While the student mentions preference for avoiding risk, they don't clearly articulate that risk aversion is about preferring certainty over uncertainty. The additional comment about taking risks when facing losses is about prospect theory behavior but doesn't define risk aversion itself.

Score: 0.5

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias refers to our tendency to exaggerate how strongly and how long we will feel certain emotions in the future, while downplaying other elements that might affect our feelings. Here, the pain of breaking up is overemphasized, whereas the dissatisfaction within the relationship is underestimated.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies impact bias as the tendency to overestimate future emotional responses, which aligns with the answer key's definition of overestimating the impact of future events on our feelings.
- Correct: The student explains that impact bias prevents breakups by causing people to overemphasize the pain of breaking up, which directly corresponds to the answer key's point about overestimating how bad a breakup will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves predicting how we will feel emotionally in the future. This concept is crucial in end-of-life choices because people often exaggerate how strong and lasting their emotions will be. The disability paradox illustrates this: although we may believe we would prefer death over living with illness or disability, when faced with the situation, our perspective usually changes.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines affective forecasting as predicting future emotional states, which matches the answer key's definition of 'predictions about our own future emotional state.'
- Correct: The student accurately captures the key concept that healthy people may predict preferring death when sick, but their actual preferences change when they become ill, which aligns with the answer key's second point about the difference between predicted and actual preferences.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

People tend to overestimate low probabilities overall. However, there is a distinction between simply low probabilities and very low probabilities, as the latter are often perceived as zero or nearly impossible to occur.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that low probabilities are overestimated, which aligns with the answer key's point about merely low probabilities being overestimated.
- Correct: The student correctly distinguishes between low and very low probabilities, noting that very low probabilities are perceived as zero or nearly impossible, which matches the answer key's point about extremely low probabilities being interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion means we dislike experiencing negative outcomes and try to minimize them, since losses carry negative utility.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes loss aversion as simply disliking losses and trying to minimize them, but fails to capture the key insight that losses are weighted more heavily than equivalent gains. The answer doesn't explain that the value function is steeper for losses than gains, which is the essential characteristic of loss aversion in prospect theory.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

The primary distinction is that the results of expected utility theory do not have to involve money. Another key difference is that expected utility theory focuses on the attractiveness or appeal of a choice.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected utility theory deals with non-financial outcomes while expected value theory is limited to monetary values, which aligns with the first point in the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student mentions 'attractiveness or appeal of a choice' but fails to specifically identify risk aversion as the key behavioral consideration that distinguishes expected utility theory from expected value theory.

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected value theory suggests that when selecting among alternatives, we evaluate the options based on their probabilities and financial outcomes to make the optimal decision. Expected utility theory operates similarly but considers outcomes beyond just financial ones. Multi-attribute utility theory (MAUT) examines options that have various attributes, each with its own utility and probability. Prospect theory resembles expected utility theory but additionally incorporates heuristics and biases into the decision-making process.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as evaluating options based on probabilities and financial outcomes for optimal decision-making, which aligns with the normative model described in the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes expected utility theory as similar to expected value theory but considering non-financial outcomes, which matches the answer key's explanation about subjective utility.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly describes MAUT as having attributes with 'probability' rather than 'weight'. The answer key specifies that each attribute has utility and weight, not probability.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies prospect theory as similar to expected utility theory but incorporating heuristics and biases, and recognizes it as a descriptive/behavioral model.

Score: 0.75

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

When individuals stand to lose something, they tend to take more risks. Loss aversion refers to the tendency to feel the pain of losses more intensely than the pleasure of gains, which reduces the extent to which people avoid risk.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion leads people to take more risks when facing potential losses, effectively reducing risk aversion. They also demonstrate understanding of what loss aversion is (feeling losses more intensely than gains) and correctly connect this to decreased risk avoidance.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning refers to the process of learning to connect two things. In classical conditioning, we come to understand that two events occur together in a specific time and place. In operant conditioning, we learn that certain actions lead to punishments while others result in rewards.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as learning to connect two things, which aligns with the answer key's definition of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as understanding that two events occur together in time and place, which matches the answer key's explanation of learning associations when things happen together.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning that actions lead to punishments or rewards, which directly corresponds to the answer key's definition.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation occurs when a cause-and-effect relationship is perceived between two variables even though none exists, although there may still be some form of covariation. Illusory correlation, on the other hand, happens when people incorrectly believe that two variables are related or vary together when they actually do not.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student confuses the definitions. They describe illusory causation as perceiving causation when none exists (which would be closer to illusory correlation), while the answer key indicates illusory causation is misinterpreting an existing correlation as causation. The student's description of illusory correlation is closer to correct but doesn't capture the key distinction that illusory causation involves misinterpreting real correlations as causal.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

The Dutch healthcare system functions as a schema since it represents a framework of understanding about a particular situation. In contrast, knowing the appropriate behavior at a birthday party is a script, as it guides us on what actions and words are expected during a common event.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the Dutch healthcare system as a schema and provides a reasonable explanation that it represents a framework of understanding, which aligns with the answer key's emphasis on knowledge and relationships.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies birthday party behavior as a script and explains it guides expected actions and words during an event, which matches the answer key's description of scripts as behavioral guidance for specific situations.

Score: 1.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

The intentional stance involves understanding behavior by considering an individual's motivations and beliefs. While behaviorists focus on how stimuli provoke actions, behavior is better explained by examining these underlying intentions.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the intentional stance as the behaviorist approach. The answer key specifies that behaviorists adopted the physical stance because they focused on stimulus-response processes, not on beliefs and motivations which would be characteristic of the intentional stance.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

They take the design stance, aiming to understand the purpose of psychological processes by examining how and why they operate in a particular manner.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance and provides an accurate explanation that they seek to understand the purpose/function of psychological processes, which aligns with the answer key's emphasis on considering processes in terms of their function.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Distinct (specific): when event B occurs shortly after event A, and A and B are closely linked, cause resembles effect.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: Student mentions 'distinct (specific)' but incorrectly defines it as temporal and spatial contiguity plus similarity, rather than B following A but not other events.
- Incorrect: Student does not mention consistency - that B always follows A.
- Incorrect: Student does not mention plausibility - that common sense makes it plausible A causes B.
- Incorrect: Student mentions temporal contiguity ('shortly after') but conflates it with distinctness rather than identifying it as a separate heuristic.
- Incorrect: Student mentions similarity ('cause resembles effect') but conflates it with other concepts rather than identifying it as a separate heuristic.

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Mere exposure means that the more we encounter something, the more familiar it becomes to us. Additionally, negativity bias leads us to focus on negative emotional content. People who express moral outrage often use strongly negative language, which attracts our attention due to this negativity bias. Since we come across this kind of language more frequently (due to mere exposure), we tend to believe that there are more morally outraged individuals than there actually are.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions negativity bias correctly as focusing on negative emotional content, but does not accurately define it as the tendency to seek out or place more weight on negative information.
- Incorrect: The student discusses 'mere exposure' instead of the availability heuristic. While mere exposure relates to familiarity through repeated encounters, the availability heuristic specifically refers to estimating frequency based on ease of recall.
- Correct: The student correctly explains the connection between the two biases - that negativity bias causes attention to morally outraged content, and this increased exposure leads to overestimating the prevalence of moral outrage.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

We are more likely to agree with individuals we like, and conversely, we are less inclined to agree with those we strongly dislike. As a result, we often avoid using things associated with people we dislike.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student explains the phenomenon in terms of social preferences and agreement rather than addressing the key concept of framework theories and domain-inappropriate application of biological contagion concepts to social/psychological domains.

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A conspiracy theory that is delusional is generally rejected by society, whereas one that is not delusional is socially accepted.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student only addresses the social acceptance criterion but misses the crucial element that a delusional conspiracy theory must also be an irrational belief. The answer key requires both conditions: irrational belief AND not commonly accepted.

Score: 0.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

Exhibiting narcissism, act confidently and assign responsibility even when it's unnecessary.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies narcissism as a factor contributing to conspiratorial thinking, which matches one of the key factors from the answer key.
- Correct: The phrase 'assign responsibility even when it's unnecessary' aligns with attributing agency where it does not exist, which is another factor from the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student only provided two clear factors. While 'act confidently' could relate to cognitive biases, it doesn't clearly match any specific third factor from the answer key such as seeing patterns in randomness, believing paranormal phenomena, or the other listed factors.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

We tend to cling to our beliefs and struggle to alter them. As a result, when we initially provide wrong answers, it becomes difficult to absorb the correct information because the incorrect response is already ingrained in our minds.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes a general tendency to stick to beliefs but does not identify the specific psychological mechanism. The answer lacks mention of source amnesia, proactive interference, or the continued-influence effect, which are the key mechanisms by which incorrect answers interfere with learning according to the answer key.

Score: 0.0

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

Repeated exposure: the more often individuals encounter something, the more acquainted they become with it, leading to increased preference.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the mere exposure effect, explaining that repeated encounters lead to familiarity and increased preference, which matches the answer key's description of the tendency to prefer familiar things.

Score: 1.0

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Individuals with good mental health often believe that negative events are unlikely to occur to them (positivity bias), which makes their predictions about the likelihood of bad outcomes less accurate; therefore, this is not true for those with major depressive disorder.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people with major depressive disorder are more accurate at predictions because they lack the positivity bias (overly optimistic tendency) that characterizes mentally healthy individuals, which aligns with the answer key's core point about reduced optimism leading to greater accuracy.

Score: 1.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

As sensory information becomes less reliable, prior beliefs have a greater impact on how we perceive things.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when sensory information becomes less reliable, prior beliefs have a greater impact on perception, which directly matches the key concept from the answer key.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

At the pre-conventional level, moral decisions are guided by the anticipation of punishment or reward. At the conventional level, moral choices are influenced by considering how others might feel. At the post-conventional level, moral judgments stem from a profound comprehension of the reasons behind the decision's morality.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the pre-conventional level as being guided by anticipation of punishment or reward, which matches the answer key's description of obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as being influenced by considering how others might feel, which aligns with the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly describes the post-conventional level as stemming from profound comprehension of reasons behind moral decisions, which corresponds to the answer key's focus on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model involves creating an explanation of cause and effect after events have occurred. Since it's simpler to focus on what actually happened rather than what might have happened, this approach tends to promote hindsight bias.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a causal model involves creating explanations of cause and effect relationships after events have occurred, which aligns with the concept of a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student accurately explains how causal models contribute to hindsight bias by noting that focusing on what actually happened (rather than alternative possibilities) makes events seem more inevitable, which is the core mechanism of hindsight bias.

Score: 1.0

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

After learning the result, we often fail to recognize that we've acquired new information that affects our probability assessments. We usually believe we understood it from the beginning, but in reality, we've simply gained additional knowledge.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that learning new information affects our ability to accurately recall past probability judgments, and explains that we fail to recognize this influence, believing we 'knew it all along.' This captures the core mechanism of how learning contributes to hindsight bias by making it difficult to ignore newly acquired knowledge when estimating past likelihood judgments.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing involves attempting to select the very best option, while satisficing means opting for a choice that is adequate or satisfactory. Maximizing is strongly associated with neuroticism, so it is more likely to be linked with that trait.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as attempting to select the very best option, which aligns with the answer key's description of trying to make the best choice.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as opting for a choice that is adequate or satisfactory, which matches the answer key's description of making a good-enough choice.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that maximizing is associated with neuroticism and would be more likely linked with that trait, matching the answer key's requirement.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

I would take a similar approach to what this course has done by incorporating AI. AI is quickly advancing and can tailor exams for individuals automatically, eliminating the need for manual effort. For instance, each week an exam could be generated by AI based on the lecture material.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement with the question by proposing a concrete solution using AI to generate personalized exams based on lecture material. This addresses the core challenge of limited time and resources while maintaining student engagement through tailored assessment.
