Grade: 2.5

## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidtâ€™s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

System 1 involves quick, automatic thinking and instinctive responses, whereas System 2 is slower, more deliberate, and logical. System 1 tends to be more influential because it triggers immediate, gut reactions that shape your moral judgments.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies System 1 as involving quick, automatic thinking and instinctive responses, which aligns with the answer key's description of System 1 as intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student accurately describes System 2 as slower, more deliberate, and logical thinking, which matches the answer key's characterization of System 2 as reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student correctly states that System 1 is more influential, explaining that it triggers immediate gut reactions that shape moral judgments, which aligns with the answer key's point that System 1 is more dominant than System 2.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

The relatedness heuristic links a key characteristic of the student (their appearance) to a profession that focuses on that same characteristic.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the heuristic as 'relatedness heuristic' instead of the representativeness heuristic. This is a fundamental error in naming the correct psychological concept.
- Correct: The student correctly explains the underlying mechanism - that we judge likelihood of category membership based on similarity between observed characteristics and those associated with the category/profession.

Score: 0.5

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring involves focusing on a single important piece of information that comes to mind, while the primacy effect refers to the tendency to remember something more easily because it was the first item in a list. Both are psychological processes that explain why people recall certain information.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes anchoring as 'focusing on a single important piece of information that comes to mind' rather than specifically identifying it as using the first piece of information as a starting point for judgments or decisions.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the primacy effect as the tendency to remember something more easily because it was the first item, which aligns with better remembering the first piece of information.
- Incorrect: The student states both are 'psychological processes that explain why people recall certain information' but fails to identify the key commonality of overreliance on first information specifically.

Score: 0.3333333333333333

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion involves taking actions to prevent negative outcomes or reduce losses, while risk aversion focuses on avoiding risk altogether and making decisions that prioritize safety.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly describes loss aversion as taking actions to prevent losses, rather than the psychological tendency to weigh losses more heavily than equivalent gains.
- Incorrect: The student describes risk aversion as avoiding risk and prioritizing safety, which is related but misses the key concept of preferring certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 0.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias refers to avoiding certain actions due to the anticipated effects they might have on the environment or oneself. It can stop individuals in long-term relationships, marriages, or cohabitations from breaking up because the consequences, such as moving out or going through a divorce, seem too difficult to handle.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly defines impact bias as avoiding actions due to anticipated effects, rather than the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Incorrect: While the student mentions that anticipated consequences can prevent breakups, they don't connect this to overestimating how bad the breakup will make them feel, which is the key mechanism of impact bias.

Score: 0.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

This refers to the idea that you expect your thoughts and feelings at the end of your life to be different from those you had when you initially decided what your end-of-life experience would be. For example, a person might choose euthanasia when their illness becomes severe, but when that moment arrives, they might change their mind and no longer support euthanasia.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies affective forecasting as predictions about future emotional states, explaining it as expecting thoughts and feelings to be different from current ones.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the key concept that healthy people may predict preferring death when sick, but actually change their mind when the situation occurs, using euthanasia as a clear example.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

People tend to overestimate small probabilities, especially those that are low rather than extremely low.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people overestimate small/low probabilities, which aligns with the answer key's point about merely low probabilities being overestimated.
- Incorrect: The student states that overestimation is especially strong for low rather than extremely low probabilities, but doesn't mention that extremely low probabilities are often treated as impossibilities, missing this key distinction from prospect theory.

Score: 0.5

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

it represents the choices made to reduce losses as much as possible

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes loss aversion as choices to reduce losses, which is more about behavior/decision-making rather than the utility representation. The answer key requires explaining that loss aversion means negative utilities are weighted more heavily than positive utilities or that the value function is steeper for losses than gains.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory primarily deals with financial outcomes and the worth of a decision, whereas expected utility theory is more subjective and considers additional factors in the decision-making process.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory deals with financial outcomes while expected utility theory is more subjective and considers additional factors, which aligns with the answer key point about financial vs non-financial values.
- Incorrect: The student mentions that expected utility theory considers 'additional factors' but does not specifically identify risk aversion or the contrast with expected value theory's lack of consideration for heuristics and biases.

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesnâ€™t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease peopleâ€™s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Loss aversion decreases the likelihood that individuals will avoid taking risks.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion decreases risk aversion (makes people less likely to avoid risks), which aligns with the key point that loss aversion can make people risk-seeking when trying to avoid potential losses.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves responding to an event when it occurs. Classical conditioning is straightforward, focusing on creating a connection so that one event triggers a specific response. In contrast, operant conditioning is more complex.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes conditioning as 'responding to an event when it occurs' which misses the key concept that conditioning is about learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that classical conditioning involves creating connections between events that trigger responses, which aligns with learning associations when things happen together in time and space.
- Incorrect: The student only mentions that operant conditioning is 'more complex' without explaining that it involves learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 0.3333333333333333

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation occurs when one event is believed to cause another, whereas illusory correlation happens when two events are seen to happen together regularly, creating the impression of a pattern.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's answer misses the key distinction. They describe illusory causation as simply believing one event causes another, but don't specify that it involves incorrectly interpreting an actual correlation as causal. For illusory correlation, they describe it as seeing events happen together regularly, but fail to capture that it's about perceiving correlation where none actually exists - the student's description could apply to actual correlations.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to â€˜properlyâ€™ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

Knowing how to act appropriately at a birthday party is a schema because your behavior is guided by past experiences at similar events and established social norms. In contrast, comprehending the Dutch healthcare system is a script since it requires learning and studying its structure and procedures.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the healthcare system as a script when it should be a schema. Healthcare system knowledge represents organized information and relationships between concepts, not sequential behavioral steps.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies birthday party behavior as a schema when it should be a script. Birthday party behavior involves a sequence of appropriate actions in a specific social situation, which defines a script, not general knowledge organization.

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

Because you strongly dislike the person, your mind categorizes them as 'bad' and views everything associated with them as 'bad' as well.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes a general psychological mechanism of negative association but fails to identify the key concept from framework theories: that biological domain knowledge (contagion as disease transmission) is being incorrectly applied to the social/psychological domain where it doesn't belong.

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

The creation of a conspiracy theory founded on absolutely no factual evidence.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student only mentions lack of factual evidence but misses the key distinction that delusional conspiracy theories require both irrationality AND lack of common acceptance. The answer is incomplete and doesn't address the dual criteria that differentiate delusional from non-delusional conspiracy theories.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you donâ€™t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

The tendency to believe, after an event has occurred, that one would have predicted or expected the outcome.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student provided the definition of hindsight bias, which is unrelated to the question about how incorrect answers during self-quizzing can interfere with learning. The correct answer should discuss source amnesia, proactive interference, or the continued-influence effect.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

the anchoring effect helps key points to remain prominent and easy for people to recall

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the anchoring effect, which refers to over-relying on the first piece of information encountered. The correct answer should be mere exposure effect (tendency to prefer familiar things) or illusory-truth effect, not anchoring.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Certainly.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student provided no substantive answer to the question about whether major depressive disorder affects accuracy in predicting negative events. The response 'Certainly' does not address the key point that people with depression are more accurate due to reduced optimism bias.

Score: 0.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

The impact of previous beliefs on perception lessens.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student answer states that prior beliefs have less impact when sensory reliability decreases, which is the opposite of what the answer key requires. According to the ideal-observer model, when sensory information becomes less reliable, the brain relies more heavily on prior beliefs to make perceptual decisions.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You donâ€™t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other peopleâ€™s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model clarifies the reasons behind events occurring at certain times and adds to hindsight bias by leading people to believe they ought to have predicted the outcome using the model of cause and effect.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a causal model explains the reasons behind events and their relationships, which aligns with the concept of a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student accurately describes how causal models contribute to hindsight bias by making people believe they should have been able to predict outcomes, which reflects the idea that events seem more inevitable in retrospect than they actually were.

Score: 1.0

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Gaining knowledge about an event after it has occurred results in hindsight bias because it provides you with insight and context for why the event took place. Later on, you feel as though you should have predicted the outcome, even though you had no prior awareness before it happened.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes the general phenomenon of hindsight bias but doesn't address the specific mechanism asked about - how learning contributes by making it impossible to avoid incorporating newly learned information when estimating past likelihood judgments. The answer focuses on feeling like one should have predicted outcomes rather than the cognitive inability to ignore new knowledge when recalling past states of knowledge.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

The maximizing decision style involves striving to achieve the best possible outcome and making the most optimal choices. In contrast, the satisficing decision style focuses on doing just enough and making decisions that are satisfactory rather than perfect. Individuals who score high in neuroticism are more inclined to use the maximizing decision style.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as striving to achieve the best possible outcome and making optimal choices, which aligns with the answer key's description of 'trying to make the best choice.'
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as focusing on decisions that are satisfactory rather than perfect, which matches the answer key's description of 'making a good-enough choice.'
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that individuals high in neuroticism are more inclined to use the maximizing decision style, which directly matches the answer key.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

I would design an exam with short-answer questions similar to this one, but for questions that ask for explanations of multiple theories, I would assign more points based on the number of theories they need to explain. This approach accounts for the primacy effect and anchoring, where students tend to remember certain pieces of information more strongly. Even if they can only define one or two theories out of four, they would still earn points and achieve a higher score. This would demonstrate that they understand the lecture content, even if the stress of the exam environment prevents them from recalling the full answer.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement by proposing a specific assessment strategy (short-answer questions with partial credit), showing understanding of psychological principles (primacy effect, anchoring), and considering practical constraints (exam stress, limited resources). The answer reflects thoughtful application of course knowledge to address the pedagogical challenge.
