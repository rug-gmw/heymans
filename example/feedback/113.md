## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidtâ€™s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

System 1 functions as the intuitive thinker, while system 2 serves as the logical thinker. Both play vital roles, but typically system 1 responds first through intuitive, emotional reactions, which is then followed by system 2's analytical reasoning.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies System 1 as intuitive thinking, which aligns with the answer key's requirement that System 1 refers to intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies System 2 as logical/analytical reasoning, which matches the answer key's requirement that System 2 refers to reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student states that System 1 'responds first' and describes the typical sequence as intuitive reactions followed by analytical reasoning, which demonstrates understanding that System 1 is more dominant according to Haidt's model.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

This assumption stems from the representativeness heuristic, which means assuming that if certain features of something resemble those of a particular category, that thing is likely part of that category.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that the representativeness heuristic involves judging category membership based on resemblance to typical features of that category, which matches the core concept from the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring describes the tendency for individuals to cling to their initial impression of something. The primacy effect highlights that these first impressions stay in our memory and influence our later judgments about that thing, carrying more significance than subsequent impressions. In this way, first impressions serve as a mental anchor.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as clinging to initial impressions, which aligns with the concept of taking the first piece of information as a starting point.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as first impressions staying in memory and influencing later judgments, which corresponds to better remembering the first piece of information.
- Correct: The student clearly connects both concepts by stating that 'first impressions serve as a mental anchor,' demonstrating understanding that both involve overreliance on first information.

Score: 1.0

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion means placing greater importance on losses than on gains. Risk aversion describes the tendency of individuals to avoid risky and uncertain situations, favoring certainty instead.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves placing greater importance on losses than gains, which matches the answer key's definition.
- Correct: The student accurately describes risk aversion as the tendency to avoid risky and uncertain situations while favoring certainty, which aligns with the answer key's definition of preferring certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 1.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias refers to the tendency to exaggerate the emotional effect an event will have. This can lead individuals to avoid ending relationships, mistakenly believing that a breakup will bring more distress and unhappiness than it likely will.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies impact bias as the tendency to exaggerate emotional effects of events, which aligns with overestimating the impact of future events on feelings.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that impact bias prevents breakups because people mistakenly believe the breakup will cause more distress than it actually will, matching the answer key's point about overestimating how bad it will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting refers to the process of estimating how future events will influence one's emotions. This concept is crucial in end-of-life choices because individuals often act according to their anticipated feelings. As a result, they may make future decisions that they later regret when the time arrives, such as in situations involving dementia.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines affective forecasting as predicting future emotional states, which aligns with the answer key's definition of 'predictions about our own future emotional state.'
- Correct: The student accurately captures the key insight that people may make decisions based on predicted feelings that don't match their actual feelings when the situation occurs, exemplified by their dementia example which parallels the answer key's healthy/sick distinction.

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

Prospect theory suggests that individuals tend to overvalue small probabilities, though they generally regard extremely small probabilities as nearly impossible.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that prospect theory suggests people overvalue (overestimate) small/low probabilities, which aligns with the answer key point about merely low probabilities being overestimated.
- Correct: The student accurately states that extremely small probabilities are regarded as 'nearly impossible,' which corresponds to the answer key point that extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion describes the tendency for individuals to perceive losses as having a greater negative impact than what would be predicted by expected utility theory.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The answer describes loss aversion as a general behavioral tendency but fails to explain what it reflects specifically in terms of utility in prospect theory - that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities or that the value function is steeper for losses than gains.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory links outcomes solely to monetary values, whereas expected utility theory considers a broader range of utilities, including subjective ones. Additionally, expected utility theory incorporates risk aversion, which is not addressed by expected value theory.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory deals with monetary values while expected utility theory considers broader utilities including subjective ones, which aligns with the answer key's distinction between financial and non-financial values.
- Correct: The student accurately states that expected utility theory incorporates risk aversion while expected value theory does not, which matches the answer key's point about expected utility theory considering risk aversion versus expected value theory not considering heuristics and biases.

Score: 1.0

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesnâ€™t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected value theory assists in decision-making by linking potential outcomes to their monetary values and chances of occurring. Expected utility theory aids decisions by relating outcomes to their utilities and probabilities, while also considering individuals' risk aversion. Multi-attribute utility theory resembles expected utility theory but accounts for outcomes that have multiple characteristics, each with its own utility and importance. Prospect theory is like expected utility theory but additionally incorporates cognitive shortcuts and biases.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as dealing with monetary values and probabilities, which matches the answer key's description of financial outcomes with probabilities.
- Correct: The student accurately describes expected utility theory as dealing with utilities and probabilities while considering risk aversion, which aligns with the answer key's description of subjective utility beyond just financial outcomes.
- Correct: The student correctly explains multi-attribute utility theory as having multiple characteristics with their own utility and importance, which matches the answer key's description of multiple attributes with utilities and weights.
- Correct: The student accurately describes prospect theory as incorporating cognitive shortcuts and biases, which corresponds to the answer key's mention of heuristics and biases in this descriptive model.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease peopleâ€™s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

People tend to take greater risks when facing a loss, as they try to prevent that loss. Experiencing losses increases risk-seeking behavior.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people become more risk-seeking when facing losses, which directly addresses how loss aversion decreases risk aversion and can make people risk seeking to avoid potential losses.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves learning to connect events through their co-occurrence. Classical conditioning occurs when you learn to link events that frequently occur together in time and place. Operant conditioning happens when you learn to associate your behaviors with consequences, such as rewards or punishments.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as learning to connect events through co-occurrence, which aligns with the answer key's definition of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as learning to link events that frequently occur together in time and place, which matches the answer key's explanation of associating things that happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning to associate behaviors with consequences like rewards or punishments, which directly corresponds to the answer key's definition of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory correlation is the perception of a relationship between two variables when none actually exists, whereas illusory causation involves mistakenly believing that one event causes another simply because they are correlated, even though there is no direct cause-and-effect link.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly distinguishes between illusory correlation (perceiving a relationship between variables when none exists) and illusory causation (mistakenly interpreting correlation as causation). The explanation accurately captures that illusory correlation involves perceiving non-existent correlations, while illusory causation involves misinterpreting existing correlations as causal relationships.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to â€˜properlyâ€™ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

A schema refers to the understanding of how the Dutch healthcare system operates. The script describes the expected behavior at a birthday party. A schema is knowledge built on connections between ideas, like frameworks, that guide our comprehension and actions in various situations. A script is a type of social and cultural schema related to typical scenarios.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that understanding the Dutch healthcare system is a schema and provides an accurate explanation that schemas are knowledge built on connections between ideas and frameworks that guide comprehension.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that birthday party behavior is a script and accurately explains that scripts are a type of social and cultural schema related to typical scenarios, which aligns with the answer key's explanation of scripts as social schemas for specific situations.

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

Behaviorists likely take a physical (mechanical) approach, focusing on quantifying the physical aspects of how stimuli elicit behavior. They ignored intentions and beliefs because they believed the mind was not measurable.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that behaviorists adopted the physical stance and provides accurate reasoning - they focused on quantifiable physical processes of stimulus-response relationships while avoiding mental constructs they deemed unmeasurable.

Score: 1.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

Evolutionary psychologists take the intentional stance, as it examines behavior by considering an individual's intentions and beliefs. Among the three approaches, this is the most effective for understanding human behavior.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the intentional stance instead of the design stance. Evolutionary psychology focuses on the function and adaptive purpose of psychological processes (design stance), not on individual intentions and beliefs (intentional stance).

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

- Uniqueness (specificity): If event A occurs exclusively when event B occurs, they are likely connected. - Reasonableness: If the link between A and B seems reasonable, they are likely related. - Forecasting ability: If the occurrence of A reliably indicates that B will follow, they are likely associated. - Temporal and spatial proximity: If A and B usually take place together in time and place, they are likely connected. - Comparable cause and effect: If the cause of A resembles the effect of B, they are likely linked.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the concept of distinctness/specificity, though they phrase it slightly differently. They understand that A causes B when B follows A exclusively or specifically.
- Correct: The student captures the essence of consistency with 'forecasting ability' - the idea that A reliably predicts B, which aligns with B always following A.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies plausibility as 'reasonableness' - the concept that the causal link should make common sense.
- Correct: The student accurately describes contiguity in time and space as 'temporal and spatial proximity' - events occurring together in time and place.
- Incorrect: The student misunderstands similarity in cause and effect. They describe 'cause of A resembling effect of B' rather than A and B superficially resembling each other.

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

The availability heuristic and negativity bias both play a role in this phenomenon. The availability heuristic involves judging the probability of an event based on how readily examples come to mind. Negativity bias refers to people's preference for negative information and the stronger impact negative content has compared to positive content. Together, these factors make individuals more vulnerable to negative information, leading them to overestimate the frequency of such events.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias and provides an accurate definition, describing it as people's preference for negative information and its stronger impact compared to positive content.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the availability heuristic and provides an accurate definition, explaining it as judging probability based on how readily examples come to mind.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of how these biases work together, explaining that negativity bias makes people more vulnerable to negative information, which then leads to overestimating frequency through the availability heuristic mechanism.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

This occurs when individuals connect theoretical frameworks from various fields of knowledge, resulting in illogical reasoning.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The answer is too vague and doesn't specifically identify that biological contagion concepts are being misapplied to the social/psychological domain, which is the key insight required by the answer key.

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A delusional conspiracy theory is generally rejected by society, whereas a non-delusional conspiracy theory may be accurate and widely accepted.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that delusional conspiracy theories are rejected by society (not commonly accepted) and that non-delusional conspiracy theories can be accurate and widely accepted. While they don't explicitly mention irrationality as a criterion, they capture the key distinction about social acceptance and potential accuracy.

Score: 1.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

Three of these factors include: having narcissistic traits, believing in supernatural events, and preferring straightforward explanations for complex matters.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies narcissistic traits as a factor contributing to conspiratorial thinking, which matches 'being narcissistic' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student mentions 'believing in supernatural events' which corresponds to 'believing paranormal phenomena' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student identifies 'preferring straightforward explanations for complex matters' which aligns with 'believing in simple explanations for complex events' from the answer key.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you donâ€™t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

These wrong answers can disrupt learning via classical conditioning. In other words, you come to link the question with a certain answer or piece of information, and if that answer is wrong, it becomes harder to adjust your mental process to learn and provide the correct response.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes classical conditioning as the mechanism, which is incorrect. The answer key specifies source amnesia (forgetting that an answer was incorrect), proactive interference (old incorrect answers interfering with new correct ones), or the continued-influence effect. Classical conditioning involves learning associations between stimuli and responses, but doesn't explain how incorrect answers interfere with remembering correct ones through memory confusion mechanisms.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

They could employ the anchoring technique by establishing a mental reference point connected to that statement.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies anchoring as the mechanism. The answer key requires mere exposure effect or illusory-truth effect, which explain how repetition increases familiarity and perceived truth. Anchoring refers to relying heavily on the first piece of information encountered, which is not the psychological mechanism behind making repeated messages more attractive.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Individuals with major depressive disorder rarely show, or completely lack, a positivity bias. This bias involves the belief that negative events are unlikely to occur to oneself. Consequently, since those with MDD do not experience this bias, their expectations regarding negative outcomes are also influenced.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people with major depressive disorder lack the positivity bias (optimism bias) that leads non-depressed people to underestimate negative outcomes. This directly supports the answer key point that MDD makes people more accurate at predictions by reducing overly optimistic tendencies.

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

As sensory information becomes less reliable, prior beliefs have a greater impact on perception.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that decreased reliability of sensory information leads to increased influence of prior beliefs on perception, which directly matches the core concept in the answer key.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You donâ€™t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other peopleâ€™s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

The three stages of moral development are: - pre-conventional: typically seen in children, where actions are judged as good if they lead to rewards and bad if they result in punishment; it focuses on self-interest and limited give-and-take - conventional: characterized by conforming to social norms and laws, aiming to be viewed as good by others and society; it also involves assisting others - post-conventional: represents a broader, more abstract level of moral reasoning based on universal principles and a deeper comprehension of societal functioning.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the pre-conventional level as focusing on rewards and punishment, which aligns with the answer key's description of obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as conforming to social norms and aiming to be viewed as good by others, which matches the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the post-conventional level as involving abstract moral reasoning based on universal principles, which aligns with the answer key's description of focus on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model links causes to various decisions and their outcomes. With hindsight bias, individuals focus on the decisions that were actually taken and the results they produced, but fail to consider alternative ways the events could have unfolded.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a causal model links causes to outcomes, which aligns with the concept of a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student accurately explains how causal models contribute to hindsight bias by describing how people focus on actual outcomes while failing to consider alternatives, which makes events seem more inevitable than they were.

Score: 1.0

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

When reflecting on past events, it is nearly impossible to ignore information acquired afterward. This leads to hindsight bias, as your judgment about what decisions should have been taken is influenced by knowing the eventual outcome.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that newly learned information cannot be avoided when making retrospective judgments, which is the core mechanism of how learning contributes to hindsight bias. The explanation captures the essence that hindsight bias occurs because post-event knowledge influences our ability to accurately recall or estimate our previous likelihood judgments.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Satisficing involves choosing options that are adequate or satisfactory, while maximizing involves striving to select the best possible option. The maximizing approach is frequently linked to feelings of regret and higher levels of neuroticism. Individuals with high neuroticism tend to prefer the maximizing decision-making style.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as 'striving to select the best possible option' which aligns with the answer key's 'trying to make the best choice'.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as 'choosing options that are adequate or satisfactory' which matches the answer key's 'making a good-enough choice'.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that 'individuals with high neuroticism tend to prefer the maximizing decision-making style' which directly matches the answer key.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

If the lectures highlight that the exam will include open-ended questions requiring a thorough grasp of the content, and emphasize the consequences of not studying or comprehending it well, students may become more willing to participate and engage.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement with the question by proposing a specific strategy to encourage active engagement through exam design and clear communication of expectations. The answer shows understanding that exam structure can motivate student behavior and addresses the constraint of limited resources by suggesting an approach that doesn't require extensive personalized feedback.
