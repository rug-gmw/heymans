## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

System 1 is the primary driver in this model. It suggests that moral judgments are mainly shaped by heuristics and emotions, which allow us to quickly form initial opinions on moral issues. System 2 plays a smaller role, contributing rational thinking only after an initial judgment has been made.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 involves emotions and heuristics, which aligns with the answer key's requirement that System 1 refers to intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 2 involves rational thinking, which matches the answer key's requirement that System 2 refers to reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student clearly states that System 1 is the primary driver and plays a larger role than System 2, which correctly identifies System 1 as more dominant according to Haidt's model.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

Representativeness heuristic. Our mental image of a typical fashion model closely matches the appearance of our colleague, making this image more prominent in our minds and leading us to form this assumption.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding that the heuristic involves matching someone's appearance to our mental stereotype/image of a fashion model, which aligns with the key concept of estimating likelihood based on resemblance to category stereotypes.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring is the concept that the initial information encountered during decision-making sets a benchmark that influences how subsequent choices are evaluated. The primacy effect occurs when the first trait we learn about a person significantly shapes our later evaluations of them. Both phenomena share the idea that the initial details we receive carry an outsized influence on our decisions and judgments.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as using initial information as a benchmark that influences subsequent evaluations, which aligns with the answer key's definition of taking the first piece of information as a starting point.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as the first trait learned about a person significantly shaping later evaluations, which corresponds to the answer key's point about better remembering the first piece of information.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both phenomena involve initial details having outsized influence on decisions and judgments, which matches the answer key's point about overreliance on the first piece of information.

Score: 1.0

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

The first refers to a dislike of losses (humans tend to avoid losing anything, preferring to gain), whereas the second relates to a dislike of risk: people generally seek to avoid uncertainty, preferring sure outcomes.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves a dislike of losses and mentions that humans prefer to gain rather than lose, which captures the essence that losses are weighted more heavily than gains.
- Correct: The student accurately describes risk aversion as a dislike of risk and uncertainty, with people preferring sure outcomes, which correctly captures the preference for certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 1.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias refers to our tendency to exaggerate the emotional effects we expect an event to have on us. This can cause individuals to avoid ending relationships because they mistakenly believe they will feel worse after the breakup than they do while still in the relationship.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as the tendency to exaggerate emotional effects of future events, which matches the answer key's definition of overestimating the impact of future events on our feelings.
- Correct: The student accurately explains how impact bias prevents breakups by describing that people avoid ending relationships because they overestimate how bad they will feel afterward, which aligns with the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting refers to the tendency to predict how we will feel emotionally in the future, but these predictions are often inaccurate. Therefore, when facing end-of-life decisions, a person’s feelings and thoughts may change compared to what they anticipated beforehand. Although someone may try to imagine their future emotions prior to the situation, these estimations are unreliable and should be reevaluated, with factors like impact bias and emotional evanescence significantly influencing this process.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines affective forecasting as predictions about future emotional states, though they add the accurate detail that these predictions are often inaccurate.
- Correct: The student captures the key concept that people's actual feelings may differ from their predictions when facing end-of-life situations, which aligns with the answer key's point about healthy people potentially changing their preferences when actually sick.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

People tend to overrate small probabilities. When it comes to extremely low probabilities, they are frequently seen nearly as sure events, resulting in an even greater overestimation.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people overestimate small/low probabilities, which aligns with the answer key's first point.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that extremely low probabilities are seen as 'nearly sure events' with greater overestimation, when the answer key indicates they are actually interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 0.5

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to our tendency to strongly avoid losing possessions. In the context of prospect theory, it is represented by a high level of utility associated with avoiding losses.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes loss aversion as avoiding losses with high utility for avoiding them, but doesn't capture the key concept that negative utilities (losses) are weighed more heavily than equivalent positive utilities (gains), or that the value function is steeper for losses than gains.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

The values given to utilities are subjective, making expected utility a personal concept rather than one that can be applied universally. Additionally, the initial model is based on economic principles.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions subjective utilities but does not clearly distinguish that expected value theory deals only with financial values while expected utility theory deals with non-financial values as well.
- Incorrect: The student mentions economic principles but fails to address the key difference regarding heuristics/biases and risk aversion between the two theories.

Score: 0.0

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected Value Theory is an economic normative model that incorporates probabilities and economic values to calculate the expected value, suggesting that the option with the highest value should be chosen. It applies specifically to situations with only two options. Expected Utility Theory is similar but replaces expected economic values with expected utility, reflecting a subjective value individuals assign to options during decision-making rather than objective economic worth; the higher the value, the greater the utility. Multi-Attribute Utility Theory differs by considering multiple attributes and is intended for decisions involving more than two options; like Expected Utility Theory, it uses utility instead of economic values. Prospect Theory is a descriptive model that unlike the others, accounts for heuristics and emotions influencing decision-making, aiming to explain how people actually make choices rather than prescribing the optimal choice.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies Expected Value Theory as a normative model that uses probabilities and financial outcomes to calculate expected value. However, the claim that it 'applies specifically to situations with only two options' is incorrect - it can handle multiple options.
- Correct: The student accurately describes Expected Utility Theory as similar to expected value theory but using subjective utility instead of purely financial outcomes. The explanation captures the key distinction between objective financial value and subjective utility.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies Multi-Attribute Utility Theory as dealing with multiple attributes and using utility values. However, the statement about it being 'intended for decisions involving more than two options' is not a defining characteristic - the key point about weights for attributes is missing.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies Prospect Theory as a descriptive (behavioral) model that accounts for heuristics and biases in decision-making, contrasting it with the normative models. The explanation captures the key distinction between descriptive and prescriptive approaches.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

We want to avoid risk since it also increases the likelihood of losing, and we favor gains over losses.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that loss aversion makes people avoid risk, when actually loss aversion can make people risk-seeking when trying to avoid losses. The student misses the key insight that people will accept risk to avoid potential losses.

Score: 0.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning is a method through which we come to connect two events. Classical conditioning involves learning that one event predicts another. In operant conditioning, we also learn these associations, but this process is guided by reinforcements, which can be either positive or negative.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as connecting/associating events, which aligns with learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as learning that one event predicts another, which matches the concept of learning associations when things happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning involves learning associations guided by reinforcements (positive or negative), which corresponds to learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Both refer to a relationship that appears to exist but is actually nonexistent. The first involves a causal connection, where A causes B, whereas the second involves a correlation, where A does not directly cause B but frequently occurs prior to B.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly describes both concepts as involving nonexistent relationships, when illusory causation involves a real correlation that is misinterpreted as causation. Additionally, the student's explanation of illusory correlation as 'A frequently occurs prior to B' describes temporal association rather than the key concept that illusory correlation is perceiving correlation where none actually exists.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

How to act at a birthday party is considered a script, as it involves a step-by-step process with certain rules to follow for appropriate behavior. In contrast, the Dutch health system is a schema, since it represents an understanding of how something functions. This schema aids in becoming familiar with the system more quickly.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that understanding the Dutch healthcare system is a schema and provides an appropriate explanation that it represents knowledge of how something functions, which aligns with the answer key's explanation about knowledge and relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script and explains it involves a step-by-step process with rules for appropriate behavior, which matches the answer key's description of a social schema for specific situational behavior.

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

An intentional stance focuses on observing behavior and the goals behind our actions, without assuming any mental processes occurring inside the mind.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies behaviorists as adopting the intentional stance, when they actually adopted the physical stance. Additionally, the student's description of the intentional stance is inaccurate - the intentional stance involves attributing beliefs, desires, and goals to explain behavior, while behaviorists specifically rejected mentalistic explanations and focused on stimulus-response mechanisms at the physical level.

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

A design stance explains the reasons behind our behavior by showing that we are built to operate in this manner.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the design stance and provides an accurate explanation that aligns with evolutionary psychology's approach of explaining psychological processes in terms of their functional design and purpose.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

When reasoning in this way, we often combine information from various fields to reach a conclusion. For instance, by applying the concept of contagion, we might use biological understanding of how germs and bacteria transmit to justify avoiding something that a particular person has handled.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that biological concepts of contagion (germs and bacteria transmission) are being applied to social/psychological situations (avoiding objects from disliked people), which matches the answer key's point about incorrectly applying biological domain concepts to the social domain.

Score: 1.0

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

Non-delusional conspiracy theories are those grounded in events that could realistically occur, even if they are uncommon or involve complex and detailed scenarios. In contrast, delusional conspiracy theories include elements that are fictional and impossible in reality. For example, a nonsensical aspect of a delusional theory might be the idea that a black cat crossing the street causes bad luck, a belief that is unfounded and not supported by factual evidence.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student focuses on distinguishing conspiracy theories based on realistic vs. fictional/impossible elements, but misses the key criteria from the answer key: that delusional conspiracy theories are defined by being both irrational beliefs AND not commonly accepted. The student's example about black cats and bad luck is also not relevant to conspiracy theories and doesn't demonstrate understanding of the dual criteria (irrationality + lack of common acceptance).

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

Limited education, low earnings, and a propensity for social withdrawal.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: Limited education relates to low intelligence/education level which is mentioned in the answer key, but the student's phrasing is imprecise and doesn't clearly match the key points.
- Incorrect: Low earnings is not mentioned in the answer key as a factor contributing to conspiratorial thinking.
- Incorrect: Social withdrawal is not listed among the cognitive and personality factors in the answer key that contribute to conspiratorial thinking.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Negativity bias can affect how you evaluate your preparation by causing you to focus on not knowing the answer, which in turn worsens your feelings and creates a downward spiral.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes negativity bias and its emotional effects on test preparation, but this does not address the specific mechanism by which incorrect answers interfere with learning. The answer key requires explanation of source amnesia, proactive interference, or continued-influence effect - psychological mechanisms where incorrect answers are later misremembered as correct or interfere with learning the correct information.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

The key point here is the mere exposure effect, which means that when statements are repeated frequently, they become more familiar, increasing the chances that people will either accept them or start to think about them.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the mere exposure effect as the psychological mechanism and accurately explains that repetition leads to increased familiarity, which makes statements more attractive/acceptable to people.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Yes, it does. Individuals with MDD often make more extreme predictions, expecting more negative events to occur to them than is actually true, which lowers their accuracy.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that MDD makes people less accurate at predictions due to excessive negativity. The answer key indicates that people with MDD are actually more accurate because they have reduced optimism bias, not because they are overly pessimistic.

Score: 0.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

When sensory information becomes less reliable, we rely more heavily on our prior beliefs. In this situation, our previous expectations take a leading role in shaping how we make decisions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when sensory information becomes less reliable, prior beliefs have increased influence on perception. They accurately describe this as 'relying more heavily on prior beliefs' and that 'previous expectations take a leading role,' which directly corresponds to the answer key's point about perception being increasingly affected by prior beliefs when sensory reliability decreases.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

The stages are pre-conventional, conventional, and post-conventional. The initial stage, typically observed in children, focuses on acting to avoid punishment and maximize personal gain. The second stage, where most women (stage 3, social care) and men (stage 4, justice and laws) usually remain, represents a point where moral reasoning stabilizes to support a well-functioning society. The final stage involves more abstract and philosophical moral reasoning, addressing higher ethical considerations, but according to this model, it is rarely attained.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the pre-conventional level and accurately describes it as focusing on avoiding punishment and maximizing personal gain, which aligns with the answer key's description of obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the conventional level and describes it as stabilizing moral reasoning to support a well-functioning society, which corresponds to the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the post-conventional level and describes it as involving abstract and philosophical moral reasoning with higher ethical considerations, which matches the answer key's description of focusing on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

Causal models explain cause-and-effect relationships between events. This can lead to hindsight bias, as it makes it simpler to identify causes, making people more likely to say they "knew it all along."

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that causal models explain cause-and-effect relationships between events, which aligns with the concept of a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student accurately explains how causal models contribute to hindsight bias by making it easier to identify causes after the fact, leading to 'knew it all along' thinking, which captures the essence of events seeming more inevitable than they were.

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

This is connected to the idea of the curse of knowledge: after acquiring certain information, it's challenging for us to ignore it. Similarly, with hindsight bias, once we are aware of the outcome, it's hard not to take it into account.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that learning contributes to hindsight bias through the curse of knowledge mechanism, explaining that once information is acquired, it becomes difficult to ignore when making retrospective judgments. This demonstrates understanding of how newly learned information inevitably influences past likelihood estimates.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing involves choosing the option that leads to the optimal result, whereas satisficing means selecting a choice that is simply good enough. Individuals with high levels of neuroticism are more likely to use a maximizing approach when making decisions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as choosing the option that leads to the optimal result, which aligns with 'trying to make the best choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as selecting a choice that is simply good enough, which matches 'making a good-enough choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that individuals with high neuroticism are more likely to use a maximizing approach, which matches the answer key's statement about adopting the maximizing decision style.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

The task should be completed individually rather than in groups. This prevents social loafing and ensures that each person actively interacts with the content. Additionally, the assignment could be more directly tied to the course material, encouraging us to read the textbook.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement by providing specific pedagogical strategies (individual vs. group work to prevent social loafing, tying assignments to course material to encourage reading). While brief, the response shows thoughtful consideration of how to promote active engagement within resource constraints.
