## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidtâ€™s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

The social-intuitionist model suggests that moral judgments begin with intuition, an emotional reaction guided by System 1 thinking. Once an intuitive moral judgment is formed, individuals then generate rational explanations to support their decision; this reasoning step involves more conscious, effortful System 2 thinking. In this model, System 1 plays the primary role.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 thinking involves intuition and emotional reactions in the context of moral judgment.
- Correct: The student accurately describes System 2 thinking as involving reasoning, rational explanations, and conscious, effortful thought processes.
- Correct: The student clearly states that System 1 plays the primary role, correctly identifying it as the dominant system in Haidt's model.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

The representativeness heuristic is based on the idea that people tend to judge whether something belongs to a particular category by how closely it resembles the typical members of that category.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process in this scenario.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that the representativeness heuristic involves judging category membership based on resemblance to typical category members, which captures the essence of estimating likelihood based on stereotype similarity.

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring refers to the tendency for initial information to have an outsized impact on a person's final evaluation. The primacy effect means that information encountered first is more likely to be remembered than information that follows. Together, these effects play a role in shaping how impressions are formed.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as initial information having an outsized impact on evaluation, which aligns with the answer key's definition of taking first information as a starting point.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as information encountered first being more likely to be remembered, which matches the answer key's definition.
- Correct: The student recognizes that both effects involve the influence of first-encountered information on impression formation, which demonstrates understanding of their common overreliance on initial information.

Score: 1.0

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion means individuals value preventing losses more than acquiring equivalent gains, while risk aversion refers to the common tendency for people to prefer avoiding risk whenever they can.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves valuing the prevention of losses more than acquiring equivalent gains, which matches the answer key's definition.
- Correct: The student accurately describes risk aversion as the tendency to prefer avoiding risk, which aligns with the answer key's concept of preferring certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 1.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias refers to the tendency to overpredict the duration and intensity of emotional reactions to future events. For example, a person may believe a breakup will cause them intense negative feelings, but they often overestimate how strong and long-lasting those emotions will be. As a result, they may choose to avoid ending an unhappy relationship to escape those anticipated feelings.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as overestimating emotional reactions to future events, which aligns with the answer key's definition of overestimating the impact of future events on future feelings.
- Correct: The student accurately explains how impact bias prevents breakups by describing how people overestimate the negative emotional impact of breaking up, leading them to avoid ending unhappy relationships.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting refers to individuals' attempts to anticipate their emotional reactions to future events. In decisions about end-of-life care, this process is influenced by projection bias, where people assume their current mental and physical condition will continue unchanged when predicting their future feelings. This assumption may not accurately represent how they will feel about situations like future disability, raising the issue of whether healthcare providers should follow wishes stated before the disability or those expressed at the time of the disability.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines affective forecasting as predicting future emotional reactions to events, which aligns with the answer key's definition of predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of the key concept through projection bias - that healthy people may make different end-of-life preferences when healthy versus when actually experiencing illness/disability, which matches the answer key's point about preferences changing from healthy to sick states.

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

In general, people tend to overvalue small chances, but when probabilities are extremely low, they often regard them as impossible.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people overvalue (overestimate) small chances, which aligns with the answer key's point about merely low probabilities being overestimated.
- Correct: The student correctly states that extremely low probabilities are often regarded as impossible, which matches the answer key's point about extremely low probabilities being interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency of individuals to prioritize avoiding losses over acquiring equivalent gains. This happens because the negative impact of a loss is felt more strongly than the positive impact of a similar gain.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion means losses are felt more strongly than equivalent gains, which directly corresponds to the answer key's point that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

In expected value theory, gains and losses are expressed as monetary amounts, whereas in expected utility theory, they are represented by utilities. Unlike expected value theory, expected utility theory takes loss aversion into account.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory deals with monetary amounts while expected utility theory uses utilities, which captures the distinction between financial and non-financial values.
- Incorrect: The student mentions loss aversion rather than risk aversion. While both are behavioral concepts, the answer key specifically refers to risk aversion as the key difference.

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesnâ€™t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected utility theory is a normative decision-making model suggesting that individuals make choices based on the anticipated desirability of various outcomes, with the ideal being to select the option with the highest expected utility. Expected value theory is a normative economic decision-making model where choices are driven by the expected monetary value of different outcomes, recommending selection of the option with the greatest expected value. Multi-attribute utility theory is a normative decision-making model in which the utility of each outcome depends on the desirability and importance weight of its attributes. Prospect theory is a descriptive decision-making model that expands on expected utility theory by including heuristics and biases.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as a normative model focused on monetary outcomes and selecting the option with greatest expected value, which matches the key concept of financial outcomes with probabilities.
- Correct: The student accurately describes expected utility theory as a normative model based on anticipated desirability of outcomes and selecting highest expected utility, correctly distinguishing it from expected value theory by noting non-financial utility.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies multi-attribute utility theory as a normative model where utility depends on attributes with desirability and importance weights, matching the answer key's description of multiple attributes with utilities and weights.
- Correct: The student accurately describes prospect theory as a descriptive model that builds on expected utility theory by incorporating heuristics and biases, correctly identifying its behavioral/descriptive nature.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease peopleâ€™s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

People tend to fear losses more than they value equivalent gains, so instead of risking a chance at a higher reward, they choose a safer option with a guaranteed but smaller benefit.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly describes loss aversion as making people more risk averse by choosing safer options. The answer key indicates that loss aversion actually decreases risk aversion and can make people risk-seeking when trying to avoid potential losses.

Score: 0.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves forming connections between events that often happen at the same time. Classical conditioning refers to learning a link between two stimuli because they regularly appeared together. Operant conditioning involves learning to associate a behavior with the consequences that follow, such as rewards or punishments.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as forming connections/associations between events, which aligns with the key concept of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as learning links between two stimuli that regularly appear together, which matches the answer key's explanation of associating things that happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning to associate behavior with consequences like rewards or punishments, which directly corresponds to the answer key's definition.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation occurs when someone believes there is a cause-and-effect link between two events when no such connection exists. Illusory correlation happens when someone assumes that two events are related or connected, even though they are not. The distinction lies in the kind of relationship people perceive between the events.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student confuses the definitions. They describe illusory causation as perceiving causation where none exists (which is actually closer to illusory correlation), rather than the correct definition of misinterpreting an existing correlation as causation. They also describe illusory correlation as assuming relatedness where none exists, missing that it specifically refers to perceiving correlation between uncorrelated variables.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to â€˜properlyâ€™ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

Understanding the Dutch healthcare system is a schema because it reflects a specific set of knowledge formed from previous experiences about what to expect. Knowing how to act at a birthday party is a script, as it involves a set of expectations about how typical events usually unfold based on past experience.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the healthcare system as a schema and provides a valid explanation that it represents organized knowledge and expectations, which aligns with the concept of schemas as knowledge structures.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies birthday party behavior as a script and explains it involves expectations about how events unfold, which captures the essence of scripts as behavioral sequences for specific situations.

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

Behaviorists focused on the physical level of analysis, drawing conclusions about mental processes by examining observable physiological data generated through behavior.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that behaviorists adopted the physical stance/level of analysis. While the explanation differs slightly from the answer key (mentioning physiological data rather than stimulus-response processes), it demonstrates understanding that behaviorists focused on observable, measurable physical phenomena rather than internal mental states.

Score: 1.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

Design level of analysis â€“ evolutionary psychologists aim to understand the adaptive function of various behaviors, focusing on the reasons these behaviors developed, which reflects the design perspective.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance/level of analysis and provides an accurate explanation that they focus on understanding the adaptive function and reasons why behaviors developed, which aligns with the design perspective's emphasis on function and purpose.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

- Distinctiveness means that event Bâ€™s reaction to event A stands out as unique.  
- Plausibility refers to the idea that, on the surface, it appears reasonable that event A caused event B.  
- Consistency indicates that event A consistently leads to event B across multiple instances over time.  
- Congruity in time and space means that event B happened soon after event A and followed it physically.  
- Similarity between cause and effect suggests that event A and event B share common superficial characteristics.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies distinctiveness and explains it as B's unique reaction to A, which captures the core concept that B follows A but not other events.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies consistency and explains it as A consistently leading to B across multiple instances, which matches the answer key's concept that B always follows A.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies plausibility and explains it as appearing reasonable that A caused B, which aligns with the answer key's description of common sense plausibility.
- Correct: The student uses 'congruity' instead of 'contiguity' but correctly explains the concept as B happening soon after A and following it physically, capturing both temporal and spatial aspects.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies similarity between cause and effect and explains it as A and B sharing common superficial characteristics, which matches the answer key exactly.

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Availability heuristic refers to the tendency of individuals to judge the likelihood or frequency of events based on how readily examples of those events come to their memory. Negativity bias means that people are drawn to negative information. Since morally outrageous content is negative, it attracts more attention (negativity bias) and spreads widely. Consequently, people encounter morally outrageous content often and thus overestimate how common outraged reactions are (availability heuristic).

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines negativity bias as people being drawn to negative information and identifies that morally outrageous content is negative, which aligns with the answer key's description of negativity bias as seeking out or placing more weight on negative information.
- Correct: The student accurately defines availability heuristic as judging likelihood or frequency based on how readily examples come to memory, which matches the answer key's definition of estimating frequency based on ease of recall.
- Correct: The student correctly explains the causal relationship: negativity bias causes attention to morally outrageous content, which increases exposure and examples, leading to overestimation through availability heuristic. This matches the answer key's explanation of how these biases work together.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

The magical contagion effect happened because I used understanding from biology (how viruses and bacteria transmit) and applied it to psychology. From this, I concluded that a person's negative traits can transfer to an object, similar to how a virus spreads.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that biological concepts of contagion (viruses and bacteria transmission) are being inappropriately applied to the psychological/social domain, demonstrating understanding that framework theories from one domain are being misapplied to another domain where they don't belong.

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

Delusional conspiracy involves irrational beliefs that contradict scientific understanding, whereas non-delusional conspiracy theories are more logical and consistent with scientific principles and natural laws.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student focuses on scientific understanding and logical consistency but misses the key criterion from the answer key that distinguishes delusional from non-delusional conspiracy theories based on whether they are commonly accepted or not. The answer key requires both irrationality AND lack of common acceptance for a theory to be considered delusional.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you donâ€™t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Continued influence effect refers to the phenomenon where previously learned incorrect information continues to affect our understanding, even after we have been presented with the correct information, potentially causing false beliefs.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the continued-influence effect as a mechanism where incorrect information continues to influence understanding even after correction, which directly addresses how incorrect quiz answers can interfere with learning. This matches the alternative answer provided in the answer key.

Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

Mere exposure means we tend to prefer things that are familiar to us, and this familiarity can be created by repeatedly encountering or hearing something.

Feedback:

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Mentally healthy people tend to underestimate the likelihood of negative events occurring to them, displaying unrealistic optimism. In contrast, individuals with major depressive disorder have more accurate predictions because they exhibit less unrealistic optimism.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people with major depressive disorder are more accurate at predicting negative events because they show reduced unrealistic optimism compared to mentally healthy individuals who tend to underestimate negative event likelihood.

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

As the trustworthiness of sensory input diminishes, prior beliefs have a stronger influence on perception.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when sensory information becomes less reliable (described as 'trustworthiness diminishing'), prior beliefs exert greater influence on perception. This directly matches the key concept from the answer key.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You donâ€™t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other peopleâ€™s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

Pre-conventional level: morality is judged according to rewards and punishments. Conventional level: morality is based on how actions affect others' feelings and on following rules set by authority. Another aspect of the conventional level involves a more advanced grasp of moral principles, including recognizing that these principles can sometimes conflict.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the pre-conventional level as focused on rewards and punishments, which aligns with the answer key's description of obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as based on how actions affect others' feelings and following rules set by authority, which matches the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention or describe the post-conventional level at all. The additional details about conventional level principles are still within the conventional stage, not the post-conventional level which focuses on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model involves individuals attempting to explain past events by identifying their causes. Recognizing the factors that led to an event creates a sense that the outcome was unavoidable, which plays a role in hindsight bias.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a causal model involves explaining past events by identifying causes, which captures the essence of creating a coherent narrative of how events are related.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that recognizing causal factors creates a sense that outcomes were unavoidable, which directly addresses how causal models contribute to hindsight bias by making events seem more inevitable.

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

When someone knows the true outcome of an event, they experience the curse of knowledge, meaning they are unable to prevent this information from affecting their judgment when estimating the likelihood of that outcome in hindsight. As a result, their retrospective assessment tends to align more closely with the actual outcome, demonstrating hindsight bias.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly explains that learning (knowing the true outcome) creates the curse of knowledge, which prevents people from avoiding the influence of newly acquired information when making retrospective likelihood judgments. This directly addresses how learning contributes to hindsight bias through the inability to disregard known outcomes.

Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing involves selecting the best possible choice, while satisficing means picking an option that is satisfactory. Someone with a high level of neuroticism is more inclined to engage in maximizing.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as selecting the best possible choice, which aligns with the answer key's description of trying to make the best choice.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as picking an option that is satisfactory, which matches the answer key's definition of making a good-enough choice.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that someone with high neuroticism is more inclined to engage in maximizing, which directly matches the answer key's statement.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

To ensure students stay actively engaged with the material, I would bring back Slimstampen to assess their understanding of terminology. Each Slimstampen round would need to be completed within a set time limit, similar to the intro to psychology course. The consequence of not finishing the task would motivate students to complete the quizzes and thereby learn the terminology. Additionally, to minimize resource demands, I would base grades solely on the final deliverable, focusing resources on grading essays rather than exams. However, I would avoid making the deliverable a group task, as I believe the current motivating measures (such as noting individual contributions) are insufficient. If individual assignments arenâ€™t possible, I would clearly state that students who put in inadequate effort on group work will lose points from their final grade. This stronger incentive might prove more effective.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement by providing a detailed, multi-faceted approach to the problem. They reference specific tools (Slimstampen), consider resource constraints, propose concrete solutions for maintaining engagement while minimizing grading burden, and thoughtfully address potential issues with group work. The answer shows clear understanding of the trade-offs between engagement and resource limitations.
