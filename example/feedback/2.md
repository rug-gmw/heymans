# Exam grade and feedback for 2

Grade: 5.5

## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidtâ€™s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

In moral intuition, system 1 plays the leading role as it operates quickly and unconsciously, often relying on heuristics and biases due to its rapid nature. In contrast, moral reasoning occurs later, when there is more time to reflect, involving the slower, more deliberate system 2 that focuses on thoughtful analysis.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 operates through intuition, describing it as operating 'quickly and unconsciously' which aligns with the intuitive/emotional nature specified in the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 2 involves reasoning, describing it as 'slower, more deliberate' and involving 'thoughtful analysis' which corresponds to rational thought/deliberation from the answer key.
- Correct: The student clearly states that 'system 1 plays the leading role' in moral judgment, which directly indicates System 1's dominance over System 2 as required by the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

I can't remember the precise term, but the heuristic involved is base-rate neglect, where people incorrectly believe that the chance of her being both a model and a student is greater than each individual option. In reality, the likelihood of both conditions occurring simultaneously is quite low, similar to the Linda paradox.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the heuristic as 'base-rate neglect' when the correct answer is the representativeness heuristic. The student seems to be confusing this with the conjunction fallacy from the Linda problem.
- Incorrect: The student's explanation describes the conjunction fallacy rather than the representativeness heuristic. The explanation does not address how resemblance to a stereotype influences probability judgments, which is the core of the representativeness heuristic.

Score: 0.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring involves using the initial information learned as a reference point and then modifying it based on new information. The primacy effect refers to the tendency to better recall information that is presented at the beginning. Both concepts share the aspect of order, as they emphasize the importance of the first information encountered.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as using initial information as a reference point, which aligns with the answer key's definition of taking the first piece of information as the starting point.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as the tendency to better recall information presented at the beginning, which matches the answer key's definition of better remembering the first piece of information.
- Correct: The student identifies that both concepts share the importance of first information encountered, which corresponds to the answer key's point about overreliance on the first piece of information, though expressed in slightly different terms.

Score: 1.0

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the reluctance to experience any loss, while risk aversion is a behavioral tendency to avoid taking risks or engaging in risk-seeking actions.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes loss aversion as 'reluctance to experience any loss' which misses the key concept that losses are weighted more heavily than equivalent gains. This doesn't capture the asymmetric valuation aspect that defines loss aversion.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies risk aversion as a tendency to avoid taking risks, which aligns with preferring certainty over uncertainty, though the phrasing is somewhat informal.

Score: 0.5

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias refers to the tendency to overestimate how much a particular decision will affect one's emotions. This often causes individuals to avoid ending relationships, even when they are dissatisfied, because they anticipate feeling more anxiety, sadness, and stress than they likely will.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as overestimating how much future events will affect emotions, which matches the answer key's definition of overestimating the impact of future events on future feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly explains that impact bias prevents breakups because people overestimate negative emotions (anxiety, sadness, stress) they'll experience, which aligns with the answer key's point about overestimating how bad a breakup will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves anticipating how you will feel emotionally in the future. This is significant for end-of-life choices because it requires predicting your emotional state if you were to become chronically ill or paralyzed, helping you make informed decisions. People often assume they will feel worse in such situations than they ultimately do, which is an important factor to consider when making these decisions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines affective forecasting as anticipating or predicting future emotional states, which matches the answer key's definition of 'predictions about our own future emotional state.'
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of the key concept that people may misjudge their future emotional responses to illness, noting that 'people often assume they will feel worse in such situations than they ultimately do,' which aligns with the answer key's point about healthy people predicting they'll prefer to die when sick but potentially not preferring that when actually sick.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

When the likelihood is extremely low (like 0.01%), people tend to dismiss it as 'impossible,' even though the percentage indicates there is a slight chance it could occur. This perspective is different for a 10% probability, as that figure is not typically considered too low to be deemed impossible.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student does not address whether merely low probabilities (10%) are overestimated, only that they are not dismissed as impossible.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that extremely low probabilities (0.01%) are treated as impossibilities by people.

Score: 0.5

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

According to Prospect Theory, individuals perceive outcomes as either losses or gains, and loss aversion refers to their preference to avoid losses. In terms of utility, this means people are reluctant to miss out on a discount or similar benefit because it is viewed as a loss, which they seek to avoid.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves preference to avoid losses, but fails to explain the key utility concept that negative utilities are weighted more heavily than positive utilities, or that the value function is steeper for losses than gains. The discount example doesn't demonstrate understanding of the asymmetric weighting of utilities.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value and expected utility differ because expected utility incorporates a behavioral aspect by attempting to quantify how something will affect your feelings. Additionally, expected utility deals with a more abstract concept of utility, while expected value is centered on a more subjective notion of value.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions that expected utility deals with 'abstract concept of utility' vs 'subjective notion of value' but doesn't clearly identify that expected value theory deals specifically with financial values while expected utility theory encompasses non-financial values.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected utility incorporates behavioral aspects by attempting to quantify feelings/emotions, which aligns with the concept that expected utility theory considers risk aversion while expected value theory does not consider heuristics and biases.

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesnâ€™t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

1. Expected utility theory is a normative framework that evaluates decisions abstractly to identify the best option, focusing on calculating optimal choices rather than accurately representing actual behavior. 2. Expected value theory builds on expected utility by incorporating a social aspect, considering how a choice might affect one's image (e.g., paying for a date to appear favorable). It remains a normative model but still falls short in explaining actual behavior. 3. Another normative theory (possibly related to multiple criteria) introduces weights to different outcomes to improve decision-making. 4. Prospect theory, developed by Daniel Kahneman and Tversky, is a descriptive model that accounts for factors like gains and losses, utilities, and framing effects, offering a more accurate depiction of real-world decision behavior.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes expected utility theory but confuses the order and relationship with expected value theory. Expected value theory comes first and deals with financial outcomes, while expected utility theory extends this to subjective utilities.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly describes expected value theory as building on expected utility theory and incorporating social aspects. Expected value theory is actually the simpler model focusing on financial outcomes with probabilities.
- Incorrect: The student vaguely mentions 'another normative theory' with weights but doesn't clearly identify it as multi-attribute utility theory or explain that it deals with multiple attributes each having utility and weight.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies prospect theory as a descriptive model developed by Kahneman and Tversky that accounts for behavioral factors like gains/losses and framing effects, providing a more accurate depiction of real behavior.

Score: 0.25

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease peopleâ€™s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

When a situation is presented in terms of losses, individuals are more likely to take risks since they perceive that they have nothing to lose and everything to gain. Conversely, when a situation is framed around gains, people are generally more cautious because they believe they have more to lose, which increases their loss aversion. People often experience the pain of losing â‚¬100 more intensely than the pleasure of winning the same amount.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion makes people more willing to take risks when facing potential losses, demonstrating understanding that loss aversion can decrease risk aversion and even make people risk-seeking in loss situations.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves mentally linking two elements. In operant conditioning, this means associating a specific behavior with a particular outcome. In classical conditioning, it involves connecting a certain environment or stimulus with a response or consequence.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as involving mental linking/association between elements, which aligns with the key concept of learning associations through covariation.
- Incorrect: The student describes classical conditioning as connecting environment/stimulus with response/consequence, but misses the key temporal aspect - that it's about learning associations when two things happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as associating behavior with outcomes, which captures the essence of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation refers to mistakenly believing that one variable causes another when it does not. Illusory correlation involves wrongly perceiving a relationship or connection between two unrelated things.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that illusory causation involves mistakenly believing in a causal relationship when none exists, and illusory correlation involves wrongly perceiving a relationship between unrelated variables. This captures the key distinction between incorrectly interpreting correlation as causation versus perceiving correlation where none actually exists.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to â€˜properlyâ€™ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

The first example (healthcare) is a schema since it offers details about the situation and context. The last example (acting at a party) is a script because it outlines a specific pattern of behavior related to the associated schema.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies healthcare as a schema and provides a reasonable explanation that it involves contextual knowledge, which aligns with the answer key's emphasis on knowledge and relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies birthday party behavior as a script and explains it involves specific behavioral patterns, which matches the answer key's description of scripts as behavioral guidance for specific situations.

Score: 1.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

The physical or mechanical level is important because it focuses on determining how the mind can be quantified.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies behaviorists as adopting the physical stance for the wrong reason. While behaviorists did adopt the physical stance, it was not because they wanted to quantify the mind - they actually rejected studying the mind entirely and focused on observable stimulus-response relationships. The student's explanation contradicts the behaviorist rejection of mental phenomena.

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

The cognitive level is chosen because it aims to clarify the evolutionary processes that drive this behavior.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the 'cognitive level' as the stance, when the correct answer is the 'design stance.' Additionally, the student's explanation about clarifying evolutionary processes doesn't accurately capture that evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

The representativeness heuristic is a mental shortcut where people judge the probability of an event based on how much it resembles their existing stereotypes or typical examples.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: Student mentions representativeness heuristic which is unrelated to causation judgment. Does not address distinctness/specificity heuristic.
- Incorrect: Student does not mention or explain the consistency heuristic for judging causation.
- Incorrect: Student does not mention or explain the plausibility heuristic for judging causation.
- Incorrect: Student does not mention or explain the contiguity in time and space heuristic for judging causation.
- Incorrect: Student does not mention or explain the similarity in cause and effect heuristic for judging causation.

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

One factor that plays a role is the availability bias; since we frequently encounter morally outraged individuals on social media, we assume they are more numerous than they actually are, leading us to overestimate their presence. Another bias that influences this is the XXXXX

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student does not identify the negativity bias, which is one of the two primary biases mentioned in the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the availability heuristic (calling it 'availability bias') and provides an accurate explanation of how it causes overestimation based on frequent encounters with morally outraged content on social media.
- Incorrect: The student does not explain the connection between the two biases - how negativity bias increases attention to morally outraged content, which then feeds into the availability heuristic to cause overestimation.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

You may avoid using items that once belonged to someone you strongly dislike because, according to framework theories, individuals with similar traits and tendencies are grouped together. As a result, you want to avoid being perceived as belonging to the same category as that person.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's answer focuses on social categorization and avoiding being grouped with disliked individuals, but fails to identify the key concept of cross-domain application. The answer key requires explaining how biological contagion concepts are incorrectly applied to social/psychological domains, which the student does not address.

Score: 0.0

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

The key difference between a delusional conspiracy theory and a non-delusional one is that the latter may be plausible and based on realistic possibilities, whereas the former is generally unrealistic, like the example of 'Pizzagate.'

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student identifies plausibility as the key distinction but misses the critical components from the answer key: that delusional conspiracy theories must be both irrational beliefs AND not commonly accepted. The student focuses only on plausibility/realism without addressing the social acceptance criterion that distinguishes delusional from non-delusional conspiracy theories.

Your answer:

1) Lower intelligence 2) Male gender 3) Narcissistic traits

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identified 'lower intelligence' which matches 'having a low level of intelligence' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identified 'male gender' which corresponds to 'being a man' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identified 'narcissistic traits' which matches 'being narcissistic' from the answer key.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you donâ€™t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Sometimes, we persist in believing incorrect information even after it has been proven false, which means you may still recall the incorrect answer.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the continued-influence effect, which is explicitly mentioned in the answer key as an acceptable general term for this phenomenon where incorrect information persists despite correction.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

Through confirmation bias and repetition, they aim to make it accepted as 'common knowledge' by continually restating it.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student identifies confirmation bias and repetition effects but misses the specific psychological mechanism from the answer key. The correct answer is mere exposure effect (tendency to prefer familiar things) or illusory-truth effect, not confirmation bias which relates to seeking information that confirms existing beliefs.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Individuals with major depressive disorder often have a less optimistic outlook when making predictions, which may lead them to perceive situations less accurately as they typically focus on the negative aspects of a decision.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that people with major depressive disorder are 'less accurate' due to focusing on negative aspects, when the answer key indicates they are actually 'more accurate' because their reduced optimism makes their predictions more realistic.

Score: 0.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

The posterior should move toward the evidence to form a meaningful conclusion. However, the prior remains a significant factor, even when its trustworthiness is questioned and people tend to adjust their posterior only minimally.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student discusses how people adjust their posterior minimally when prior trustworthiness is questioned, but fails to address the key point about what happens when sensory information reliability decreases. The answer does not explain that decreased sensory reliability leads to increased influence of prior beliefs on perception.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You donâ€™t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other peopleâ€™s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

Pre-conventional: Recognizing an action and anticipating a mutual return (I'll help you if you help me). Conventional: understanding which actions correspond to specific reactions. Post-conventional: considering others' perspectives and attempting to comprehend their feelings.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes pre-conventional level as 'mutual return' which partially captures the reward aspect, but misses the key elements of avoiding punishment and obeying rules to gain rewards or avoid consequences.
- Incorrect: The student describes conventional level as 'understanding which actions correspond to specific reactions' which is too vague and doesn't capture the focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Incorrect: The student describes post-conventional level as 'considering others' perspectives and comprehending their feelings' which actually sounds more like conventional thinking, and misses the key focus on abstract principles and universal values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model involves believing that one event or situation directly caused another. This relates to hindsight bias because, after an outcome is known, we often feel like we "should have predicted" it or "knew all along" that one event would lead to the next. However, in truth, it was impossible to have known this beforehand.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a causal model involves connecting events in a cause-and-effect relationship, which aligns with the concept of a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student accurately explains how causal models contribute to hindsight bias by making outcomes seem predictable in retrospect ('should have predicted' or 'knew all along'), which captures the essence of events seeming more inevitable after they occur.

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Learning leads to hindsight bias because we believe that, based on previous experiences, we can foresee and avoid similar outcomes in the future, even when that is not actually feasible.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly describes hindsight bias as being about predicting future outcomes based on past experiences. The answer key indicates that hindsight bias occurs when estimating past likelihood judgments - we cannot avoid incorporating newly learned information when trying to recall what we thought before we knew the outcome. The student's answer confuses hindsight bias with overconfidence or prediction bias.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing involves aiming to achieve the optimal outcome in every choice, while satisficing focuses on obtaining a result that is simply acceptable. Maximizing is associated with the Big Five personality trait of neuroticism and can lead to stress.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as aiming to achieve the optimal outcome, which aligns with 'trying to make the best choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as focusing on obtaining an acceptable result, which matches 'making a good-enough choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that maximizing is associated with neuroticism, which satisfies the requirement that high neuroticism leads to adopting the maximizing decision style.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

In my experience, some lecturers incorporate a question-and-answer segment during their lecturesâ€”more so during Covid than nowâ€”to encourage students to engage with the reading material. Others include a short quiz, usually about three questions, at the end of the day before the lecture, which is then explained or discussed during class. I have found it helpful in this course to exchange feedback with other students to maintain a critical thinking approach. In some of my previous courses, we used a tool called 'Feedback Fruits,' where students review each other's papers and can see the comments made by others, facilitating mutual learning.
