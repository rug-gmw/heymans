# Exam grade and feedback for 34

Grade: 7.5

## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

The moral-intuitionist model suggests that moral judgments are primarily influenced by intuition and emotions, aligning with system 1 thinking, which is the most prevalent. However, when individuals are motivated and have enough time, they can engage in rational reflection on their morals, corresponding to system 2 thinking.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 thinking involves intuition and emotions in the context of moral judgments.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies System 2 thinking as rational reflection/reasoning, though they phrase it as 'rational reflection on their morals' rather than general reasoning.
- Correct: The student clearly states that System 1 thinking 'is the most prevalent,' correctly identifying it as the dominant system in Haidt's model.

Score: 1.0

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

The representativeness heuristic leads people to believe that if something shares characteristics with members of a particular group, it must belong to that group.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process in this scenario.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that the representativeness heuristic involves judging category membership based on shared characteristics or resemblance to group members, which captures the essence of estimating likelihood based on stereotypical resemblance.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring refers to the phenomenon where the initial information we receive about a topic affects how we think about it. The primacy effect means that the first details we come across regarding a subject tend to shape our memory or perception of it. Both anchoring and the primacy effect make it difficult to change our views even when presented with new information.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as being about initial information affecting thinking, which aligns with the answer key's definition of taking first information as a starting point.
- Incorrect: The student describes primacy effect as first details shaping memory or perception, but the answer key specifically focuses on better remembering first information, which is not clearly captured in the student's response.
- Incorrect: The student mentions difficulty changing views with new information, but fails to identify the key commonality from the answer key: overreliance on first information.

Score: 0.3333333333333333

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency of individuals to value losses more strongly than equivalent gains, leading them to try to prevent losses. Risk aversion, on the other hand, describes the preference to avoid uncertain or frightening risks altogether.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves valuing losses more strongly than equivalent gains, which matches the answer key's description of weighing losses more heavily than gains.
- Incorrect: The student describes risk aversion as avoiding 'uncertain or frightening risks altogether' rather than the preference for certainty over uncertainty. The characterization as 'frightening' adds an emotional element not present in the answer key and doesn't capture the core concept of preferring certainty.

Score: 0.5

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias refers to the tendency for individuals to overestimate the intensity and duration of their future emotions following a decision. For example, when ending a relationship, people often believe the resulting negative feelings will be more intense and long-lasting than they truly are, which can discourage them from going through with the breakup.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as overestimating future emotional responses, though they add duration which goes beyond the basic definition but is still accurate.
- Correct: The student correctly explains that impact bias prevents breakups because people overestimate how bad they will feel, matching the answer key's explanation.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting refers to how individuals attempt to predict their future emotional responses when making decisions. People often overestimate the intensity and duration of their feelings, which makes it crucial to take this into account in end-of-life choices. For example, someone who is currently healthy might believe they would want to end their life if they became seriously ill, but they may be overestimating how strong and long-lasting their negative emotions would be in that situation.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines affective forecasting as predictions about future emotional responses/states, which aligns with the answer key's definition of 'predictions about our own future emotional state.'
- Correct: The student accurately captures the key concept that healthy people may predict preferring death when sick, but may not actually prefer it when the situation occurs, demonstrating understanding of the forecasting bias in end-of-life decisions.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

People tend to overestimate small probabilities, and extremely low probabilities are exaggerated to the point of being perceived as impossible.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people overestimate small/low probabilities, which aligns with the answer key's point about merely low probabilities being overestimated.
- Correct: The student accurately describes that extremely low probabilities are perceived as impossible, which matches the answer key's point about extremely low probabilities being interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Individuals tend to be more affected by losses, causing losses to carry more weight in prospect theory than they truly deserve.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that losses carry more weight than gains in prospect theory, which captures the essence of loss aversion - that negative utilities are weighted more heavily than positive utilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory focuses on financial results, whereas expected utility theory applies to non-financial results. Expected utility theory considers risk aversion, but expected value theory does not.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory focuses on financial results while expected utility theory applies to non-financial results, which matches the answer key's distinction between financial and non-financial values.
- Correct: The student accurately states that expected utility theory considers risk aversion while expected value theory does not, which aligns with the answer key's point about expected utility theory considering risk aversion versus expected value theory not considering heuristics and biases.

Score: 1.0

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

1. Expected value theory is a normative framework used to compare and evaluate financial decisions. 2. Expected utility theory, also a normative model like expected value theory, applies to non-financial decisions and incorporates risk aversion. 3. Multiple attribute utility theory is a normative approach designed for decisions involving several attributes, each with its own utility and importance. 4. Prospect theory is a descriptive model that addresses non-financial decisions by considering individuals' biases and heuristics.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as a normative model for financial decisions, which aligns with the answer key's description of choosing between options with financial outcomes and probabilities.
- Correct: The student correctly describes expected utility theory as a normative model that applies to non-financial decisions, which matches the answer key's explanation that outcomes have subjective utility beyond just financial value.
- Correct: The student accurately describes multiple attribute utility theory as a normative approach for decisions with multiple attributes, each having utility and importance, which corresponds to the answer key's mention of attributes with utility and weight.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies prospect theory as a descriptive model that considers biases and heuristics, which aligns with the answer key's description of it being a behavioral model that incorporates heuristics and biases.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

People tend to take more risks when a situation is presented as a loss, whereas they are more cautious and avoid risks when it is presented as a gain.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion leads people to become risk-seeking when facing losses and risk-averse when facing gains, which directly addresses how loss aversion affects risk aversion by showing it can make people less risk averse or even risk seeking in loss domains.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves understanding the connection between stimuli and behavior. Classical conditioning involves recognizing that stimuli occurring close together are linked, whereas operant conditioning involves associating behaviors with consequences such as rewards or punishments.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as involving connections/associations, which aligns with the answer key's definition of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as recognizing that stimuli occurring close together are linked, which matches the answer key's explanation of learning to associate things that happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as associating behaviors with consequences like rewards or punishments, which directly corresponds to the answer key's definition of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation occurs when we believe that a relationship between two things implies one causes the other, even though we are uncertain. Illusory correlation happens when we assume two events that frequently occur together are connected or related.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly defines illusory correlation as assuming events that frequently occur together are connected, which describes actual correlation. The answer key specifies that illusory correlation is perceiving correlation between variables that do not actually correlate. The illusory causation definition is partially correct but lacks precision about correlation being misinterpreted as causation.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

Understanding the Dutch healthcare system is a schema since it outlines general information necessary for making prompt decisions. On the other hand, knowing how to behave appropriately at a birthday party is a script because it details the expected social behavior.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that understanding the Dutch healthcare system is a schema and provides a reasonable explanation that it involves general information/knowledge, which aligns with the answer key's emphasis on knowledge and relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script and accurately explains it as detailing expected social behavior, which matches the answer key's description of a social schema for specific situational behavior.

Score: 1.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

The functional perspective focuses on how a system, in this case people, respond to specific stimuli without being aware of the reasons behind their reactions.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies behaviorists as adopting the functional stance. According to Dennett's framework, behaviorists actually adopted the physical stance because they focused on the direct causal processes linking stimuli to behavioral responses, not on the functional purposes or goals of behaviors.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

1. The mechanical stance involves examining the physical characteristics of an object to identify it, such as recognizing if something is harmful or toxic. 2. The functional stance focuses on understanding how the physical features operate to comprehend a system that aids in survival. 3. The intentional stance involves studying the intentions or behaviors of people or animals to predict their actions, which can support survival.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes three different stances but does not identify which one evolutionary psychologists adopt. They mention the functional stance focuses on how features aid survival, which is closest to the correct answer, but they don't explicitly connect evolutionary psychology to the design/functional stance or explain that evolutionary psychologists analyze psychological processes in terms of their adaptive function.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

1. Specificity: B is caused exclusively by A. 2. Consistency: A consistently leads to B. 3. Plausibility: It makes sense that A results in B. 4. Contiguity in time and space: A and B occur simultaneously and in the same location. 5. Similar cause and effect: When A impacts B, B begins in the manner that A initiated.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies specificity (equivalent to distinctness) and explains that B is caused exclusively by A, which captures the essence that B follows A but not other events.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies consistency and explains that A consistently leads to B, which matches the answer key's point that B always follows A.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies plausibility and explains that it makes sense for A to result in B, which aligns with the answer key's description of common sense making the causal relationship plausible.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies contiguity in time and space and explains that A and B occur simultaneously and in the same location, which matches the answer key.
- Incorrect: While the student mentions 'similar cause and effect,' their explanation about B beginning in the manner A initiated doesn't capture the superficial resemblance between A and B described in the answer key.

Score: 0.8

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

The availability heuristic means that people judge how often something occurs based on how easily it comes to mind. Because we frequently encounter moral outrage on social media, it easily sticks in our memory, leading us to believe it happens frequently. Confirmation bias means we look for information that supports our existing beliefs. When we think moral outrage is common, we tend to search for more social media content that confirms this idea.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the availability heuristic and explains how it causes overestimation of moral outrage frequency based on ease of recall from social media exposure.
- Incorrect: The student identifies confirmation bias instead of negativity bias. While confirmation bias is a real phenomenon, the answer key specifically requires negativity bias as the tendency to seek out or weight negative information more heavily.
- Incorrect: The student does not explain the connection between the two biases working together. The answer key requires understanding how negativity bias increases attention to outraged content, which then feeds into the availability heuristic to cause overestimation.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

According to framework theory, we apply knowledge we've gained, such as from biology, where germs are transmitted through contact, to other areas like social situations, where magical thinking leads us to believe that a person's negative traits can also spread to their possessions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that biological concepts of contagion (germs spreading through contact) are being inappropriately applied to social/psychological domains, explaining magical thinking about negative traits transferring to possessions.

Score: 1.0

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A delusional conspiracy theory is one that is neither socially accepted nor justified by religion, whereas a non-delusional conspiracy theory is accepted or explained within those contexts.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the distinguishing factors. The answer key specifies that a delusional conspiracy theory must be both 'irrational' and 'not commonly accepted,' but the student focuses on social acceptance and religious justification instead of the rationality criterion, which is a key component of the correct distinction.

Score: 0.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

- Detecting order within chaos. - Looking for an uncomplicated reason behind a complex issue. - Display self-centeredness.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'detecting order within chaos' which corresponds to 'seeing patterns in randomness' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes 'looking for an uncomplicated reason behind a complex issue' which matches 'believing in simple explanations for complex events' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'display self-centeredness' which corresponds to 'being narcissistic' from the answer key.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

This is due to the anchor and adjustment process, where your initial answer serves as a reference point, and modifying it requires considerable effort.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes anchoring and adjustment, which is a cognitive bias about starting from an initial value and insufficiently adjusting from it. This does not explain how incorrect answers interfere with learning correct information. The answer key requires mechanisms like source amnesia (forgetting the source of information), proactive interference (old information interfering with new), or continued-influence effect, which specifically address how incorrect information can persist and interfere with correct learning.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

Through repeated exposure.

Feedback:

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Certainly.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student provided no substantive answer to the question about whether major depressive disorder affects accuracy in predicting negative events. The response 'Certainly' does not address the key point that people with depression are more accurate due to reduced optimism bias.

Score: 0.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

The impact of previous beliefs on perception grows stronger as the trustworthiness of sensory information diminishes.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that as sensory information becomes less reliable/trustworthy, prior beliefs have a stronger influence on perception, which directly matches the key concept from the answer key.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

1. Pre-conventional level: Individuals make moral decisions based primarily on their own self-interest. 2. Conventional level: Individuals consider the feelings and perspectives of others when making moral judgments. 3. Post-conventional level: Individuals recognize that moral reasoning varies among people and evaluate these differences thoughtfully.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that pre-conventional level involves self-interest, which aligns with avoiding punishment or gaining rewards as described in the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes conventional level as considering others' feelings and perspectives, which matches the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Incorrect: The student describes post-conventional level as recognizing varying moral reasoning among people, but this misses the key concept of focusing on abstract principles and values that transcend social norms.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model suggests that people create a coherent explanation of past events that seems logical to them. This leads to hindsight bias because once an outcome has happened, individuals view that explanation as the obvious one and believe they predicted it from the start.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a causal model is a coherent explanation/narrative of past events, which aligns with the answer key's definition.
- Correct: The student accurately explains how causal models contribute to hindsight bias by making outcomes seem obvious and predictable after the fact, which captures the essence of events seeming more inevitable than they were.

Score: 1.0

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

When we find out the result of an event, we can’t help but incorporate this new knowledge when reflecting on the past event (curse of knowledge), making us feel as if we had predicted the outcome from the beginning.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly explains that newly learned information (the outcome) cannot be avoided when reflecting on past judgments, and appropriately identifies this as the curse of knowledge. The answer demonstrates understanding of how learning contributes to hindsight bias.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

People with a satisficing decision style aim to select an option that is sufficiently good, whereas those with a maximizing decision style strive to find the optimal choice, a tendency often seen in individuals with neurotic personalities.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as striving to find the optimal choice, which aligns with 'trying to make the best choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as selecting an option that is sufficiently good, which matches 'making a good-enough choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that individuals with neurotic personalities tend toward maximizing decision style, which matches the answer key's requirement about high neuroticism scores.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

You can encourage students to engage with the course and its content through nudges. For instance, set default expectations that lectures are mandatory, but without imposing penalties for non-attendance. Provide lectures and materials online to facilitate easier access and engagement. Apply social influence by organizing students into groups for assignments related to the material, and motivate them by offering a multiple-choice exam at the end of the course that rewards a good grade for demonstrating sufficient understanding.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement with the question by providing multiple concrete strategies (nudges, default expectations, online materials, group work, multiple-choice exams) that address the core challenge of encouraging active engagement while managing limited time and resources. The answer shows understanding of behavioral concepts and practical constraints faced in university teaching.
