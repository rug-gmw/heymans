## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidtâ€™s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

System 1 is the primary influence, as moral choices are largely guided by people's intuitions. System 2, which involves slow and careful thought, is engaged when there is sufficient time to reflect, a desire to reason logically, conflicting or weak intuitions, or when another person holds different moral intuitions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 involves intuitions, which aligns with the answer key's requirement to describe System 1 as intuitive/emotional thinking.
- Correct: The student correctly describes System 2 as involving 'slow and careful thought' and reasoning logically, which matches the answer key's description of System 2 as reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student clearly states that 'System 1 is the primary influence' in moral choices, correctly identifying System 1 as dominant over System 2 according to Haidt's model.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

The assumption is based on the representativeness heuristic, which suggests that an item is probably part of a category if it closely matches the typical example or prototype of that category.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process in this scenario.
- Correct: The student accurately explains the representativeness heuristic by describing how we judge category membership based on similarity to typical examples or prototypes, which captures the essence of estimating likelihood based on resemblance to stereotypes.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring refers to using the initial information you receive as a reference point or baseline for forming your impression. Subsequent information is then interpreted relative to this initial anchor. Similarly, the primacy effect describes the tendency to remember the first information more clearly. Both concepts share the idea that the earliest information has a stronger influence on your overall perception.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as using initial information as a reference point or baseline, which aligns with the answer key's description of taking the first piece of information as the starting point.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as the tendency to remember the first information more clearly, which matches the answer key's definition of better remembering the first piece of information.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both concepts share the idea that earliest information has stronger influence on perception, which corresponds to the answer key's point about overreliance on the first piece of information.

Score: 1.0

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to people's tendency to consider losses more significant than gains, whereas risk aversion describes their preference for certainty and avoidance of uncertainty.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves considering losses more significant than gains, which aligns with the answer key's description of weighing losses more heavily than gains.
- Correct: The student accurately describes risk aversion as preference for certainty and avoidance of uncertainty, which matches the answer key's definition of preferring certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 1.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias refers to the common tendency for individuals to exaggerate the emotional effect a decision will have on their future feelings. This can make them hesitant to end a relationship, as they often overpredict the intensity and duration of the sadness they expect to experience.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as the tendency to exaggerate or overestimate the emotional effect/impact of future events on feelings, which matches the answer key definition.
- Correct: The student accurately explains how impact bias prevents breakups by stating people overpredict the intensity and duration of sadness, which aligns with the answer key's point about overestimating how bad a breakup will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting refers to the tendency of individuals to base their choices on anticipated future emotions. This is especially relevant in end-of-life decisions because people often overpredict the emotional effect of those choices. Someone may decide now based on how they believe they will feel later, but when that time arrives, their feelings might have changed. This poses an ethical challenge, particularly for individuals who may be unable to express their feelings in the future, such as those with Alzheimer's.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies affective forecasting as relating to predictions about future emotional states, though they phrase it as 'anticipated future emotions' and 'basing choices on anticipated future emotions' rather than explicitly stating it's about predicting one's own future emotional state.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of the core concept that people's actual preferences when sick may differ from their predicted preferences when healthy, explaining this through the idea that 'feelings might have changed' and connecting it to end-of-life decisions and advance directives.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

Individuals often overvalue small chances, yet they usually perceive and handle very rare probabilities as if they cannot occur.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that individuals 'overvalue small chances,' which aligns with the answer key point that merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Correct: The student accurately states that 'very rare probabilities' are handled 'as if they cannot occur,' which matches the answer key point that extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency of individuals to place greater importance on losses than on equivalent gains. In terms of utility, this indicates that they give more weight to negative utility compared to positive utility.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion means negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities, which directly matches the answer key requirement.

Score: 1.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

The two primary distinctions between expected value theory and expected utility theory are that the latter accounts for loss aversion and can be applied to subjective outcomes beyond just financial situations.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected utility theory can be applied beyond financial situations to subjective outcomes, which aligns with the answer key point about dealing with non-financial values versus only financial values.
- Incorrect: The student mentions loss aversion, but the answer key specifically refers to risk aversion. While related concepts, loss aversion is a different behavioral bias than risk aversion, and the student doesn't address the broader point about heuristics and biases versus no consideration of such factors.

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesnâ€™t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected value theory is a decision-making model that evaluates options based on their financial results and the likelihood of those results. Expected utility theory is comparable but focuses on utility rather than just probability, and the outcome can be subjective rather than solely monetary. Multiple attribute utility theory involves selecting options by assessing the various attributes each outcome possesses, assigning a utility and a weight to each attribute. Prospect theory builds on expected utility theory by also taking into account heuristics and cognitive biases.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as evaluating options based on financial outcomes and their probabilities, which matches the normative model description in the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes expected utility theory as similar to expected value theory but focusing on utility rather than just financial outcomes, and mentions subjective outcomes, which aligns with the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly explains multi-attribute utility theory as involving multiple attributes with utilities and weights for each attribute, matching the key points from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes prospect theory as building on expected utility theory while incorporating heuristics and cognitive biases, which matches the descriptive/behavioral model description in the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease peopleâ€™s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Loss aversion means that individuals give greater importance to losses than to equivalent gains. When situations are presented as potential gains, people usually prefer to avoid risks. In other words, the prospect of winning more makes people more likely to avoid taking risks.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly defines loss aversion but fails to address the key point about how it affects risk aversion. The answer only discusses risk aversion in gain contexts, missing the crucial insight that loss aversion can make people risk-seeking when trying to avoid losses.

Score: 0.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves acquiring associations based on simultaneous occurrence and experience. Classical conditioning refers to learning connections between events that occur close together in time, whereas operant conditioning involves learning that certain behaviors lead to consequences like rewards or punishments.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as involving learning associations, though uses 'simultaneous occurrence and experience' instead of 'covariation' - the core concept is accurately captured.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as learning connections between events that occur close together in time, which aligns with the answer key's description of associating things that happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning that behaviors lead to consequences like rewards or punishments, which matches the answer key's description of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation occurs when a connection between events is perceived as cause and effect, even though it is not. In contrast, illusory correlation refers to perceiving a link between two events that does not actually exist.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly distinguishes between illusory causation (perceiving causal relationships where none exist) and illusory correlation (perceiving correlations where none exist). While the wording differs from the answer key, the core concepts are accurately captured - illusory causation involves misinterpreting relationships as causal, while illusory correlation involves perceiving non-existent correlations.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to â€˜properlyâ€™ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

Comprehending the Dutch healthcare system is an example of a schema, as it involves having fundamental knowledge of its components and operation. In contrast, knowing the appropriate behavior at a birthday party is a script, since it outlines expected actions in social contexts.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the Dutch healthcare system as a schema and provides appropriate reasoning that it involves fundamental knowledge of components and operation, which aligns with schemas being knowledge structures about relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies birthday party behavior as a script and explains it as outlining expected actions in social contexts, which matches the answer key's description of scripts as social schemas for specific situational behavior.

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

Physical stance applies here since behaviorists aim to describe events solely through physical explanations. A stimulus causes a behavior, which is a physical reaction.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that behaviorists adopted the physical stance and provides accurate reasoning - they focused on physical explanations where stimuli directly cause behavioral responses, which aligns with the physical stance's emphasis on cause-and-effect processes.

Score: 1.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

Evolutionary psychologists take the design stance because it helps explain why humans exhibit certain behaviors overall, rather than focusing on an individual's specific thoughts and intentions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance and provides a reasonable explanation that aligns with the functional perspective of evolutionary psychology, though they focus more on behavioral explanation rather than explicitly mentioning function.

Score: 1.0

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Specificity means event A leads to event B because following event A, only event B takes place. Consistency refers to event B always occurring whenever event A happens. Plausibility implies that it is reasonable and logical, based on common sense, to believe event A causes event B. Contiguity in time and space means event B occurs right after event A and both events happen in the same place.

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies specificity/distinctness and explains that B follows A but not other events, matching the answer key concept.
- Correct: Student accurately describes consistency as B always occurring when A happens, which matches the answer key definition.
- Correct: Student correctly explains plausibility as being reasonable and logical based on common sense, aligning with the answer key.
- Correct: Student accurately describes contiguity in time and space as events occurring together temporally and spatially, matching the answer key.
- Incorrect: Student completely omits the fifth heuristic of similarity in cause and effect, which states that A likely causes B when they superficially resemble each other.

Score: 0.8

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

The negativity bias plays a role here, as it drives individuals to focus on negative emotional material. Additionally, confirmation bias adds to this effect by leading people to look for information that supports their existing beliefs. Together, these two biases reinforce the tendency to find negative emotional content and material that validates feelings of moral outrage.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias and explains it as driving focus on negative emotional material, which aligns with the answer key's definition of seeking out or placing more weight on negative information like morally outraged content.
- Incorrect: The student identifies confirmation bias instead of the availability heuristic as the second bias. While confirmation bias can contribute to seeking information that supports existing beliefs, it doesn't explain the overestimation mechanism described in the question.
- Incorrect: The student attempts to explain how the two biases work together but focuses on reinforcing the tendency to find negative content rather than explaining the availability heuristic mechanism where increased exposure leads to overestimating frequency of moral outrage.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

Framework theories consist of everyday intuitive beliefs about how the world operates. This can be illustrated by the tendency of individuals to apply knowledge from one area to another, even when it may not be accurate. In this instance, it appears that people use their understanding of disease transmission to assume that undesirable characteristics of disliked individuals will also affect the items associated with them.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that biological domain knowledge (disease transmission/contagion) is being inappropriately applied to the social/psychological domain, explaining how people mistakenly believe undesirable characteristics can transfer through objects.

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

Delusions are false beliefs that are not accepted by the culture. A conspiracy theory is an explanation involving a conspiracy. Conspiracy theories can be true and commonly accepted. Therefore, the distinction between a delusional conspiracy theory and a non-delusional one lies in the fact that the non-delusional conspiracy theory is culturally accepted and possibly accurate.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that the distinction lies in cultural acceptance (commonly accepted vs not commonly accepted) and demonstrates understanding that non-delusional conspiracy theories can be accurate/true, which aligns with the answer key's criteria of irrationality and common acceptance as the distinguishing factors.

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

self-centeredness, inclination to identify patterns in random data, embracing straightforward explanations for complicated occurrences or circumstances

Feedback:

- Correct: Self-centeredness directly corresponds to narcissism from the answer key, which is one of the personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking.
- Correct: Inclination to identify patterns in random data matches exactly with 'seeing patterns in randomness' from the answer key.
- Correct: Embracing straightforward explanations for complicated occurrences corresponds to 'believing in simple explanations for complex events' from the answer key.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you donâ€™t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Through anchoring, your initial response to a question, even if wrong, serves as a reference point. When you later encounter the correct answer, you update your understanding, but the original anchor heavily influences your judgment, potentially hindering your ability to fully learn the right answer.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies anchoring as the mechanism. Anchoring refers to relying too heavily on the first piece of information encountered when making decisions, but the answer key specifically looks for source amnesia (forgetting that an answer was incorrect), proactive interference (old incorrect information interfering with new correct information), or the continued-influence effect. The student's explanation doesn't address the core issue of confusing incorrect answers with correct ones due to memory failures.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

By means of confirmation bias

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student answered 'confirmation bias,' which is the tendency to search for, interpret, and recall information that confirms pre-existing beliefs. This is not the correct mechanism. The answer key requires 'mere exposure effect' (preference for familiar things) or 'illusory-truth effect' - both relate to how repetition increases familiarity and perceived truthfulness, not confirmation of existing beliefs.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Yes, because they are prone to overestimating the chances of negative events happening to them. They exhibit a positivity bias, meaning they believe they are much less likely than others to experience something unfortunate.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that people with major depressive disorder are less accurate due to overestimating negative events and having a positivity bias. The correct answer is that they are MORE accurate because they have reduced optimism bias, not that they overestimate or have positivity bias.

Score: 0.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

As sensory information becomes less reliable, prior beliefs play a greater role in shaping perception.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when sensory information becomes less reliable, prior beliefs have increased influence on perception, which directly matches the key concept from the answer key.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You donâ€™t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other peopleâ€™s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

The three stages are pre-conventional, conventional, and post-conventional. At the pre-conventional level, actions are driven primarily by self-interest and a basic sense of mutual exchange (such as "you help me, I help you"). In the conventional stage, behavior is guided by a desire to be seen positively by others and to respect authority, placing greater importance on the feelings of those around you. At the post-conventional level, there is an awareness that moral values can sometimes be in conflict, with a stronger emphasis on comprehending underlying moral principles.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the pre-conventional level and describes it as driven by self-interest and mutual exchange, which aligns with the answer key's description of focusing on avoiding punishment or gaining rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as being guided by desire to be seen positively by others and respecting authority while considering others' feelings, which matches the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the post-conventional level and describes it as emphasizing understanding of underlying moral principles and awareness of conflicting moral values, which aligns with the answer key's description of focusing on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

The dual-process model proposes two kinds of thinking: System 1 and System 2. System 1 is quick, automatic, and requires little conscious effort, whereas System 2 is slower, more intentional, and involves reflection. Hindsight bias occurs when individuals believe they predicted an outcome beforehand, despite not actually knowing it. This bias is influenced by dual processing, as System 1 generates a false sense of knowledge through the availability heuristic and curse of knowledge, while System 2 rationalizes this feeling by creating explanations for why they supposedly anticipated the result.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student discusses dual-process theory and System 1/System 2 thinking but does not define what a causal model is - a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Incorrect: While the student mentions that System 2 creates explanations after the fact, they do not explain how causal models make events seem more inevitable than they actually were, which is the key mechanism for how causal models contribute to hindsight bias.

Score: 0.0

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

The curse of knowledge makes it impossible to exclude newly learned information from your explanations or thoughts. This leads to hindsight bias, as you can't disregard the new information when reflecting on your previous predictions about the outcomes.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that newly learned information cannot be avoided when making retrospective judgments, which is the core mechanism of hindsight bias. They also correctly mention the curse of knowledge and explain how it leads to hindsight bias by making it impossible to disregard new information when reflecting on past predictions.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing involves seeking the optimal option, whereas satisficing means choosing an option that is sufficiently acceptable. Individuals with high levels of neuroticism tend to prefer a maximizing approach to decision-making.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as seeking the optimal option, which aligns with 'trying to make the best choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as choosing a sufficiently acceptable option, which matches 'making a good-enough choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that individuals with high neuroticism tend to prefer maximizing decision-making approach, matching the answer key.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

I would incorporate quizzes, such as Kahoot, at the conclusion of lectures to enhance engagement with the content. These quizzes would cover material from both the current and previous lectures, ensuring frequent repetition that helps reinforce memory retention. As a result, students might rely on the availability heuristic during exams. At the end of the course, the student with the highest cumulative quiz score would receive a prize. Framing participation as a potential loss (for example, missing out on the prize if they don't take part) tends to encourage more risk-seeking behavior, increasing the likelihood of student involvement.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement by proposing a concrete solution (Kahoot quizzes) that addresses the core challenge of limited time/resources while promoting active engagement. They show understanding of course concepts by referencing availability heuristic, loss framing, and risk-seeking behavior from behavioral economics/psychology. The approach is practical and scalable for large classes.

Score: 1.0
