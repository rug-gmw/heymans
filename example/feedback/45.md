## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

System 1 represents moral intuition and operates quickly, automatically, and with little effort. In contrast, System 2 involves moral reasoning and functions more slowly and deliberately, requiring effort. System 1 tends to be the more dominant of the two.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies System 1 as representing moral intuition, which aligns with the answer key's requirement that System 1 refers to intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies System 2 as involving moral reasoning, which matches the answer key's requirement that System 2 refers to reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student correctly states that System 1 tends to be more dominant, which satisfies the answer key's requirement that System 1 is more dominant than System 2.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

The representative heuristic occurs when we assume that a person belongs to a certain group because they share similar characteristics with members of that group.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process, though they misspell it as 'representative' instead of 'representativeness'.
- Correct: The student accurately explains the heuristic by describing how we assume group membership based on shared characteristics, which captures the essence of judging likelihood based on resemblance to stereotypes.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring refers to how the initial impression we form tends to stay fixed in our mind. The primacy effect is this tendency to remember the first impression, which acts as an anchor.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as related to initial impressions that become fixed, which aligns with the concept of taking first information as a starting point.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as the tendency to remember first impressions, which matches the answer key's definition of better remembering first information.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of their commonality by explaining how first impressions act as anchors, showing both concepts involve overreliance on initial information.

Score: 1.0

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

We usually try to avoid losses and risks, but because losses have a stronger impact on us, when we perceive a possibility of losing, we might be more willing to take risks. Therefore, while we consistently aim to prevent losses, whether we avoid risk depends on the context.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding that losses have a stronger impact ('losses have a stronger impact on us'), which captures the essence of loss aversion as weighing losses more heavily than gains.
- Incorrect: The student does not clearly define risk aversion as the preference for certainty over uncertainty. Instead, they describe how risk-taking behavior can vary by context, which misses the core definition of risk aversion.

Score: 0.5

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias occurs when individuals overestimate the extent to which events will affect them. For example, someone might think that staying single will hurt them more than being in an unhappy relationship. This exaggerated belief about the impact can stop them from ending the relationship.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as overestimating the extent to which events will affect them, which matches the answer key's definition of overestimating the impact of future events on future feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly explains how impact bias prevents breakups by describing how people overestimate how much staying single will hurt them, which aligns with the answer key's point about overestimating how bad a breakup will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves anticipating our future emotions and desires. When making end-of-life decisions, we often choose based on how we believe we will feel later. However, we are generally not very accurate at predicting our future feelings. For instance, we might think we don't want to continue living if we become ill, but when that time arrives, we may actually want to keep living. This creates difficult situations, so it’s important to recognize that we are not reliable at forecasting our future mental state.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines affective forecasting as 'anticipating our future emotions and desires' and 'predicting our future feelings,' which aligns with the answer key's definition of 'predictions about our own future emotional state.'
- Correct: The student accurately captures the key insight that healthy people may predict they will prefer to die when sick, but when actually sick may want to keep living, using very similar language to the answer key example.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

We tend to overvalue small probabilities, yet extremely low ones are regarded as impossible.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that small probabilities are overvalued/overestimated, which aligns with the answer key's point about merely low probabilities being overestimated.
- Correct: The student accurately states that extremely low probabilities are regarded as impossible, which directly matches the answer key's second point about extremely low probabilities being interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

We tend to value losses more intensely than equivalent gains, meaning that losing 10 euros feels worse than gaining 10 euros feels good. In the context of prospect theory, this implies that we steer clear of scenarios where the potential loss and gain are the same. This tendency to avoid such situations is known as loss aversion.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion means losses are valued more intensely than equivalent gains, which directly corresponds to the answer key's point that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. The example of losing 10 euros feeling worse than gaining 10 euros feeling good effectively illustrates this concept.

Score: 1.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory applies solely to financial results, whereas expected utility can account for non-financial outcomes. Additionally, expected value theory does not take losses into account, but expected utility does.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory deals only with financial values while expected utility theory can handle non-financial outcomes, which matches the first point in the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student states that expected value theory doesn't take losses into account while expected utility does, but this doesn't address the key difference about risk aversion and heuristics/biases mentioned in the answer key.

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Multi-attribution utility theory, expected utility theory, behavioral life cycle theory, and prospect theory.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: Student mentions 'Multi-attribution utility theory' which is close to multi-attribute utility theory, but provides no explanation of the model and the terminology is slightly incorrect.
- Incorrect: Student correctly identifies expected utility theory but provides no explanation of what it is or how it works.
- Incorrect: Student mentions 'behavioral life cycle theory' which is not one of the four models from the answer key. Expected value theory is missing from their response.
- Incorrect: Student correctly identifies prospect theory but provides no explanation of what it is or its key characteristics as a descriptive behavioral model.

Score: 0.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Generally, people tend to avoid losses and are therefore risk-averse when facing potential losses. However, when there is a possibility of losing something they already possess, they may become more willing to take risks. Thus, the likelihood of loss influences how risk-averse individuals are.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion can make people more willing to take risks when facing potential losses, demonstrating understanding that loss aversion can decrease risk aversion or even make people risk-seeking in loss domains.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves learning relationships or patterns through associations. Classical conditioning is the process of learning associations that typically occur close together in time and space. Operant conditioning, on the other hand, is learning that behaviors lead to rewards or punishments.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as learning associations/relationships, which aligns with the answer key's definition of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as learning associations that occur close together in time and space, which matches the answer key's explanation.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning that behaviors lead to rewards or punishments, which is essentially the same as the answer key's 'actions cause rewards or punishments.'

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory correlation is the mistaken belief that a relationship exists between two things when it does not. Illusory causation is the incorrect assumption that one thing causes another when they are merely correlated.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly distinguishes between illusory correlation (perceiving a relationship that doesn't exist) and illusory causation (incorrectly interpreting correlation as causation). Both definitions align with the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

Comprehending the health care system is a schema, meaning it is a framework of common knowledge built from experience. Knowing how to act at a birthday party is a script, which refers to culturally specific patterns of behavior. These scripts are also grounded in common knowledge frameworks.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the healthcare system as a schema and provides an accurate explanation that it represents a framework of knowledge, which aligns with the answer key's description of schemas as knowledge and relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies birthday party behavior as a script and explains it as culturally specific patterns of behavior, which matches the answer key's description of scripts as social schemas describing situational behavior.

Score: 1.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

The intentional stance centers on understanding the reasons behind behavior. It asks why we act in certain ways and why specific stimuli elicit particular behavioral reactions.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the intentional stance as the behaviorist approach. The answer key specifies that behaviorists adopted the physical stance because they focused on stimulus-response processes, not on reasons or intentions behind behavior. The student's description of asking 'why' questions about behavior contradicts behaviorism's explicit rejection of studying mental states and intentions.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

The functional perspective holds that all traits that evolved through evolution serve a behavioral purpose that aids survival. Each trait provides a benefit that supports survival.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes evolutionary psychology's functional perspective but fails to identify which of Dennett's stances (physical, design, or intentional) evolutionary psychologists adopt. The answer does not mention the design stance or explain that evolutionary psychologists analyze psychological processes in terms of their function/purpose.

Score: 0.0

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

1. Distinctive, specific: A leads to B because B consistently occurs after A and not after other events. 2. 3. Plausible: Based on existing knowledge, it is reasonable to believe that A causes B since B follows A. 4. Continuous in space and time: A causes B because when A takes place at a certain location, B happens immediately afterward there. 5.

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies distinctness/specificity and explains that B follows A but not other events, matching the answer key.
- Incorrect: Student skipped point 2 entirely - no mention of consistency (that B always follows A).
- Correct: Student correctly identifies plausibility and explains it involves using existing knowledge/reasoning to determine if A causing B makes sense.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies contiguity in time and space, explaining that A and B occur in the same location with B following immediately after A.
- Incorrect: Student left point 5 completely blank - no mention of similarity in cause and effect.

Score: 0.6

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

When individuals who are morally outraged share content, it doesn't necessarily mean they hold the same extreme opinions; they might simply be seeking attention. Creators of morally outraged content understand how to use specific language that social media algorithms recognize, helping their messages spread further. This results in an overestimation of how many people are genuinely morally outraged.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student does not mention or demonstrate understanding of the negativity bias - the tendency to seek out or place more weight on negative information like morally outraged content.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention or demonstrate understanding of the availability heuristic - the tendency to estimate frequency based on how easily examples come to mind.
- Incorrect: The student does not explain the connection between negativity bias and availability heuristic, instead focusing on algorithmic amplification and attention-seeking behavior as explanations.

Score: 0.0

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

Framework theories are everyday knowledge applied to various areas. When you strongly dislike someone, you tend to connect that negative feeling to their belongings, even though those things do not actually possess the traits you dislike. You transfer what you know about the person to another context.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that this is an example of applying knowledge from one domain (personal/social feelings about a person) to another domain (physical objects), which aligns with the answer key's point about incorrectly applying biological contagion concepts to the social/psychological domain.

Score: 1.0

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

The delusional conspiracy has already been disproven with evidence, while the non-delusional one has not been refuted.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly focuses on whether theories have been disproven by evidence, but the answer key defines delusional conspiracy theories as those that are both irrational beliefs AND not commonly accepted, regardless of whether they've been specifically refuted.

Score: 0.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

Your answer:

having a male gender, narcissistic traits, and a propensity to identify patterns in random data

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'having a male gender' which corresponds to 'being a man' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'narcissistic traits' which corresponds to 'being narcissistic' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'a propensity to identify patterns in random data' which corresponds to 'seeing patterns in randomness' from the answer key.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Source amnesia occurs when we forget where or in what context we encountered a wrong answer, leading us to mistakenly believe it is correct and potentially use it on an exam.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies source amnesia as the psychological mechanism and accurately explains how it works - forgetting the context (that the answer was incorrect) and then mistakenly believing it to be correct, which matches the answer key's explanation.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

People feel at ease with things they recognize. Repetition helps ideas become familiar in our minds, which in turn makes the political statement seem more comfortable and appealing.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the core mechanism of mere exposure - that repetition makes things familiar, which in turn makes them more appealing/comfortable. While they don't use the technical term 'mere exposure effect,' they demonstrate clear understanding of the psychological principle.

Score: 1.0

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

More accurate. Individuals with major depressive disorder lack the positivity bias that most others possess. They do not exhibit this kind of unrealistic optimism.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people with major depressive disorder are more accurate at making predictions about negative events, and accurately explains this is due to their lack of positivity bias/unrealistic optimism that non-depressed individuals typically exhibit.

Score: 1.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

This influence increases as well. The areas doubted due to low reliability are supplemented with our prior beliefs. The less reliable something is, the more we rely on our prior beliefs.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that the influence of prior beliefs increases when sensory information becomes less reliable, and accurately explains that unreliable sensory areas are supplemented by prior beliefs. This demonstrates understanding of the core principle in the ideal-observer model.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

Pre-conventional morality involves seeing good as what is rewarded and bad as what is punished, driven by self-interest and limited reciprocity. Conventional morality means acting in accordance with moral judgments and laws. Post-conventional morality recognizes the existence of different moral perspectives and involves acting based on universal moral principles.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes pre-conventional morality as focused on rewards and punishments, which aligns with avoiding punishment and gaining rewards from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes conventional morality as acting in accordance with moral judgments and laws, which corresponds to focusing on social norms from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies post-conventional morality as involving universal moral principles, which matches the focus on abstract principles and values from the answer key.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

The curse of knowledge causes people to unintentionally incorporate what they now know when reflecting on what might have occurred in the past. This leads to hindsight bias, as it alters our previous beliefs about possible outcomes that ultimately did not happen.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes the curse of knowledge rather than defining a causal model. A causal model is specifically a coherent narrative of how past events are related, not about incorporating current knowledge when reflecting on the past.
- Incorrect: While the student mentions hindsight bias, they explain it through the curse of knowledge mechanism rather than explaining how causal models make events seem more inevitable than they actually were.

Score: 0.0

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

We inevitably consider new information we've acquired. When reflecting on what we previously believed might occur, we naturally adjust that perspective based on what we've since learned. This leads to hindsight bias because, with this updated knowledge and revised viewpoint, we change our original expectations to match the actual outcome, as if we had predicted it from the start.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that we cannot avoid incorporating newly learned information when estimating past likelihood judgments, which is the core mechanism of hindsight bias. The explanation demonstrates understanding that new knowledge inevitably influences our recollection of prior expectations, leading us to believe we predicted outcomes we didn't actually predict.

Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing involves attempting to select the best possible option, while satisfying means choosing an option that is good enough. Neuroticism is linked to maximizing.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as attempting to select the best possible option, which aligns with the answer key's description of trying to make the best choice.
- Correct: The student correctly describes satisficing as choosing an option that is good enough, which matches the answer key's description of making a good-enough choice.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that neuroticism is linked to maximizing, which corresponds to the answer key stating that high neuroticism leads to adopting the maximizing decision style.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

One method to ensure engagement is to make the assignment mandatory, meaning every student must complete it to be eligible for the exam. You could create a task where students describe a personal experience involving heuristics or biases, which is then evaluated by AI. The AI can provide feedback, highlight errors or misuse of terms, and offer suggestions. Students would then revise their work and resubmit it. If the AI detects improvements, the student passes the assignment and is permitted to take the exam.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement by proposing a concrete solution that addresses the constraints mentioned in the question. They suggest using AI for automated feedback and grading to handle the resource limitations, incorporate mandatory completion to ensure engagement, and include a revision process that promotes learning. The answer shows thoughtful consideration of both the engagement goal and the practical limitations of time and resources.
