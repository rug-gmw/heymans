## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidtâ€™s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

System 1 represents the intuitive route, operating quickly and relying on gut feelings for moral decisions. System 2, on the other hand, involves reasoning, where moral judgments are made through careful and conscious thought. The model suggests that System 1 tends to dominate since we often lack the time or energy to thoroughly analyze every situation.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies System 1 as the intuitive route that relies on gut feelings, which aligns with the answer key's requirement that System 1 refers to intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student accurately describes System 2 as involving reasoning and careful, conscious thought, which matches the answer key's description of System 2 as reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student states that 'System 1 tends to dominate' and provides reasoning about lack of time/energy for thorough analysis, which correctly identifies System 1 as more dominant than System 2.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

Availability heuristic occurs when encountering a classmate triggers an immediate association. Because the brain tends to be lazy and prefers shortcuts, it grabs the first connection it comes across, resulting in an availability heuristic.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the availability heuristic instead of the representativeness heuristic. The availability heuristic involves judging probability based on how easily examples come to mind, not on resemblance to stereotypes.
- Incorrect: The student's explanation describes general cognitive shortcuts and immediate associations, but fails to explain the key mechanism of estimating likelihood based on resemblance to category stereotypes, which is central to the representativeness heuristic.

Score: 0.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring refers to the idea that when we have no prior knowledge about a topic, we rely on an initial piece of information as a reference point or baseline. For instance, in real estate, the asking price of a house serves as this anchor. The primacy effect involves being given an initial input before making a choice, which shapes our thought process accordingly. Both concepts involve receiving information beforehand that impacts how we make decisions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as relying on an initial piece of information as a reference point or baseline, which aligns with the answer key's definition of taking the first piece of information as the starting point.
- Incorrect: The student describes the primacy effect as receiving initial input that shapes thought process, but fails to capture the key aspect from the answer key that it's specifically about better remembering the first piece of information.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both concepts involve receiving information beforehand that impacts decision-making, which captures the commonality of overreliance on first information, though expressed in slightly different terms.

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Risk-averse individuals are content with their current possessions and are reluctant to risk losing them, avoiding unnecessary risks. Loss aversion describes how people are strongly unwilling to give up something they already own, often requiring a higher amount of money to part with it than they would be willing to pay to acquire it.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves people being unwilling to give up what they own and describes the endowment effect (requiring more to give up than to acquire), which demonstrates understanding that losses are weighted more heavily than gains.
- Incorrect: The student describes risk aversion as being about current possessions and avoiding unnecessary risks, but misses the key concept that risk aversion is fundamentally about preferring certainty over uncertainty in decision-making situations.

Score: 0.5

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias refers to the tendency of individuals to exaggerate the effects of certain choices, such as ending a relationship. As a result, those in unhappy relationships often believe that breaking up will have a much greater negative impact than remaining together, leading them to decide to stay.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies impact bias as the tendency to exaggerate or overestimate the effects of future events, which aligns with the answer key's definition of overestimating the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Correct: The student accurately explains how impact bias prevents breakups by stating that people believe breaking up will have a much greater negative impact than it actually would, which matches the answer key's point about overestimating how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves attempting to predict how you will feel in the future, but we tend to project our present emotions onto that future. In the context of end-of-life decisions, individuals use affective forecasting to envision their feelings during that stage. However, due to errors in imagination, these predictions can be inaccurate and may lead to difficulties when end-of-life actions are actually required.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies affective forecasting as predicting future emotional states, though they add the detail about projecting present emotions which is accurate but not required by the answer key.
- Correct: The student captures the essence that affective forecasting can be inaccurate in end-of-life contexts and lead to difficulties, which aligns with the answer key's point about healthy people's predictions versus actual preferences when sick.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

People tend to underestimate small probabilities, with the degree of underestimation increasing as the probability decreases.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student states that merely low probabilities are underestimated, but according to prospect theory, they are actually overestimated (probability weighting function shows overweighting of small probabilities).
- Incorrect: While the student mentions that underestimation increases as probability decreases, they fail to identify the key insight that extremely low probabilities are treated as impossibilities rather than just being underestimated.

Score: 0.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion is the tendency to strongly prefer avoiding losses over acquiring gains of the same amount, leading to reluctance in letting go of possessions considered current assets.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes loss aversion as a behavioral tendency but fails to explain how it is reflected in the utility function of prospect theory. The answer does not mention that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities or that the value function is steeper for losses than gains.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory applies solely to monetary items, such as financial gains or losses. In contrast, expected utility theory incorporates individual preferences and emotions. This model assigns subjective importance to different factors, making it less objective than expected value theory.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory deals with monetary/financial items while expected utility theory incorporates broader subjective factors beyond just financial values.
- Incorrect: The student mentions preferences and emotions but does not specifically address risk aversion or heuristics and biases as outlined in the answer key.

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesnâ€™t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected utility theory suggests that decisions are made by evaluating how much value we assign to different aspects of a choice, then calculating the potential gains or losses to guide our decision. Expected value theory focuses on determining which option provides the highest monetary gain. Multi-attribute utility theory is similar to expected utility theory but allows consideration of several factors when deciding. Prospect theory, on the other hand, emphasizes human behavior, accounting for biases and heuristics in decision-making, especially under conditions of risk and uncertainty.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes expected value theory as focusing on 'highest monetary gain' but misses the key probabilistic component - that each option has multiple possible outcomes with associated probabilities.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected utility theory as involving subjective value evaluation beyond just monetary outcomes, capturing the essence of utility vs. financial value.
- Correct: The student correctly describes multi-attribute utility theory as similar to expected utility theory but allowing consideration of multiple factors/attributes in decision-making.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies prospect theory as a descriptive/behavioral model that accounts for biases and heuristics, and mentions its focus on risk and uncertainty conditions.

Score: 0.75

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease peopleâ€™s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

If you strongly dislike losses and are reluctant to give up possessions, you are less likely to take risks. Therefore, greater loss aversion leads to greater risk aversion.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that loss aversion increases risk aversion. According to the answer key, loss aversion actually decreases risk aversion because people become willing to accept risks to avoid potential losses, sometimes even becoming risk-seeking in the loss domain.

Score: 0.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning is a method of learning that involves forming associations between stimuli. Classical conditioning involves creating a direct link between two stimuli, such as pressing a button resulting in receiving candy. Operant conditioning involves consequences like rewards or punishments; for example, pressing a button causes a shock, so the person learns to avoid pressing it.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as a method of learning involving associations between stimuli, which aligns with the answer key's definition of learning associations through covariation.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly describes classical conditioning as involving a button press causing candy, which is actually an operant conditioning example (action leading to consequence) rather than classical conditioning (two stimuli occurring together in time and space).
- Correct: The student correctly describes operant conditioning as involving consequences like rewards or punishments that result from actions, and provides an appropriate example of learning to avoid button pressing due to shock.

Score: 0.6666666666666666

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation involves a firm belief in a direct cause-and-effect link, often based on direct observation that A leads to B. In contrast, illusory correlation refers to a less direct connection, where we recognize a strong likelihood that A and B are connected but are unsure whether A causes B, B causes A, or the nature of their relationship; we only know that some association exists.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly describes both concepts. They define illusory causation as a 'firm belief in a direct cause-and-effect link' when it should be about incorrectly interpreting correlation as causation. They define illusory correlation as recognizing a 'strong likelihood that A and B are connected' when it should be about perceiving correlation where none actually exists. The student misses the key distinction that illusory correlation involves seeing relationships that aren't there, while illusory causation involves misinterpreting real correlations as causal.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to â€˜properlyâ€™ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

Understanding the healthcare system is an example of a schema, which is a general framework for comprehending an event. In contrast, knowing the appropriate behavior at a birthday party is a script, since it pertains to a particular situation. Scripts focus on specific social norms, such as offering congratulations to the birthday person's family.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the healthcare system as a schema and provides a reasonable explanation that it's a general framework for comprehending an event, which aligns with the concept of schemas as knowledge structures about relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies birthday party behavior as a script and explains it pertains to a particular situation with specific social norms, which matches the answer key's description of scripts as social schemas for specific situational behavior.

Score: 1.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

Mechanical perspective: Their goal is to understand the functioning of a specific mechanism, focusing solely on how it operates rather than the reasons or intentions behind it.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes a 'mechanical perspective' which is not one of Dennett's three stances (intentional, design, physical). While the description captures some aspects of behaviorism's approach, it fails to correctly identify the physical stance as specified in the answer key.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

From a design perspective, the focus is on understanding why a particular phenomenon is advantageous in evolutionary terms. The emphasis is not on the mechanisms or specific intentions behind it, but rather on the usefulness of the design itself.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance and provides accurate reasoning - they focus on understanding why psychological processes are advantageous in evolutionary terms (their function/usefulness) rather than on mechanisms or intentions, which aligns perfectly with the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Illusory correlation occurs when we notice events A and B happening close together and assume a connection. Illusory causation is when we believe event A directly causes event B, supported by observations. Temporal order helps us establish that event A takes place before event B. Consistency allows us to check if event B happens independently or only after event A. The time between events lets us measure the interval from A to B; if this gap is significant, it reduces the likelihood that A causes B.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions consistency but does not identify or explain distinctness/specificity - the heuristic that A likely causes B when B follows A but not other events.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies consistency as checking if event B happens only after event A, which aligns with the answer key's definition.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention plausibility - the heuristic that involves using common sense to judge whether A could reasonably cause B.
- Correct: The student discusses temporal aspects and time intervals between events, which relates to contiguity in time, though they don't explicitly mention spatial contiguity.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention similarity in cause and effect - the heuristic that A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Confirmation bias leads us to believe that many people are morally outraged, causing us to focus solely on posts expressing that sentiment and thus overestimating their true frequency. Negativity bias makes us more attracted to negative opinions and posts. Together, these biases cause us to repeatedly perceive a high volume of morally outraged posts, reinforcing this impression each time we use social media and resulting in an exaggerated sense of their prevalence.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions negativity bias correctly but does not define it as the tendency to seek out or place more weight on negative information. Instead, they describe it more generally as being 'attracted to negative opinions and posts.'
- Incorrect: The student does not mention the availability heuristic at all. Instead, they incorrectly identify confirmation bias as one of the two primary biases, which is not part of the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly explains the overall mechanism - that focusing on morally outraged content leads to overestimating its prevalence, though they use confirmation bias instead of availability heuristic to explain this process.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

This can be understood through a scientific perspective. When a person wears a sweater, skin cells and hairs are transferred onto it. Even after washing, traces of that individual remain on the sweater. Using this understanding, people can explain why they might choose not to wear that sweater.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student provides a biological explanation for why traces remain on objects, but fails to identify this as an incorrect application of biological domain knowledge to the social/psychological domain. The answer doesn't recognize that magical contagion involves inappropriately extending biological concepts of contamination to non-biological contexts.

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

The probability of events occurring varies. A politician engaging in corruption is quite plausible and easily conceivable. In contrast, far-fetched conspiracy theories like aliens visiting Earth and abducting people are much less grounded in reality and therefore unlikely to be true.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student discusses probability and plausibility of different conspiracy theories but fails to address the key distinction from the answer key: that delusional conspiracy theories are both irrational beliefs AND not commonly accepted. The student doesn't mention the dual criteria of irrationality and lack of common acceptance that distinguishes delusional from non-delusional conspiracy theories.

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

Social detachment, limited education, and feeling isolated from the community

Feedback:

- Incorrect: Social detachment is not listed among the cognitive and personality factors in the answer key. The answer key focuses on specific cognitive biases and personality traits rather than social isolation.
- Correct: Limited education aligns with 'having a low level of intelligence' from the answer key, as both relate to cognitive capacity and educational attainment affecting conspiratorial thinking.
- Incorrect: Feeling isolated from the community is a social factor rather than a cognitive or personality factor. The answer key specifies cognitive biases and personality traits, not social circumstances.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you donâ€™t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

The curse of knowledge refers to the idea that the information you learn first tends to remain more firmly in your memory than what you learn later. This means you may hold on to incorrect information learned initially instead of adopting the correct information learned afterward.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the mechanism as 'curse of knowledge' and provides an inaccurate definition. The curse of knowledge actually refers to the difficulty experts have in imagining what it's like not to know something. The student's description somewhat resembles proactive interference but uses the wrong terminology and doesn't accurately describe the specific mechanisms (source amnesia, proactive interference, or continued-influence effect) mentioned in the answer key.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

When phrases are repeated, we retrieve them from our long-term memory and bring them into our working memory. The more this happens, the easier it becomes to access and recall that information. Additionally, because we often forget the source of the information, we develop a specific response to the message, perceiving it as significant and therefore more appealing.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the core mechanism - that repeated exposure makes information more accessible and appealing. While they don't use the specific terms 'mere exposure effect' or 'illusory-truth effect,' they accurately describe the psychological process where repetition leads to increased familiarity and preference, and mention source forgetting which relates to the illusory-truth effect.

Score: 1.0

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Individuals experiencing major depression tend to have a negativity bias, perceiving the world in a more negative and, in some ways, more realistic manner. In contrast, those with good mental health usually exhibit a positivity bias, which can result in less accurate expectations about negative events occurring to them. Therefore, people with major depression are more precise in forecasting such outcomes.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people with major depressive disorder are more accurate at predicting negative events, and provides the correct reasoning that this is due to reduced optimism bias (described as 'positivity bias') compared to non-depressed individuals who tend to be overly optimistic.

Score: 1.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

When sensory input is reduced, prior beliefs have a stronger impact. Since one source of information for perception is lost, you must depend more on your existing beliefs.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when sensory input is reduced/unreliable, prior beliefs have a stronger impact on perception, and provides sound reasoning that reduced sensory information leads to greater reliance on existing beliefs.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You donâ€™t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other peopleâ€™s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

Pre-conventional level: morality is understood based on the consequences of punishment or reward. Conventional level: morality is viewed through the lens of societal norms and whether our actions align with what society considers right. Post-conventional level: morality is seen as a matter of personal principles and feelings about what is right or wrong.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the pre-conventional level as being based on consequences of punishment or reward, which aligns with the answer key's description of obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as being viewed through societal norms and what society considers right, which matches the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Incorrect: The student describes the post-conventional level as 'personal principles and feelings about what is right or wrong,' but the answer key specifically requires focus on 'abstract principles and values.' The mention of 'feelings' is imprecise and doesn't capture the abstract, universal nature of this level.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model of past events provides a timeline-based summary of what happened previously. Such models can increase hindsight bias because their organized approach to understanding events from a new viewpoint can cause you to forget what you originally knew when the event took place.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes a causal model as a 'timeline-based summary' which misses the key concept that it's a coherent narrative explaining how events are causally related, not just a chronological sequence.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly explains the mechanism as 'forgetting what you originally knew,' when the correct mechanism is that events in a causal model seem more inevitable than they actually were.

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Once we acquire new information, it becomes challenging to forget it. This reinforces hindsight bias, as our understanding of the situation shifts after knowing the result. It is hard for us to evaluate the decisions we made without being influenced by the outcome, since we cannot separate the result from the choices that led to it.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that newly learned information cannot be avoided when estimating past judgments, explaining that once we acquire new information it becomes challenging to forget it and influences our evaluation of past decisions. This captures the core mechanism of how learning contributes to hindsight bias.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing refers to striving to obtain the best possible outcome from a decision, often in a highly perfectionistic manner. In contrast, satisficing means being content once an acceptable option is found. Individuals with high levels of neuroticism tend to prefer a maximizing approach because they are rarely satisfied and focus intensely on details, making it difficult for them to settle.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as striving to obtain the best possible outcome, which aligns with 'trying to make the best choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as being content once an acceptable option is found, which matches 'making a good-enough choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that individuals high in neuroticism tend to prefer maximizing, providing good reasoning about their perfectionism and difficulty settling, which supports the answer key point.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

To encourage active engagement with the content, it is important to consider how it is presented. A helpful approach is to offer advice on beginning the reading in a positive manner. Rather than warning that failing to keep up with the reading will lead to failure, the focus could be shifted to highlighting the book's interesting nature or the brevity of the chapters. This positive framing serves to motivate students.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement with the question by proposing a specific pedagogical strategy focused on positive framing of course materials. They identify a concrete problem (how to motivate reading engagement) and offer a thoughtful solution (emphasizing interesting content and manageable chapter length rather than using fear-based motivation). This shows genuine consideration of how to promote active student engagement within resource constraints.
