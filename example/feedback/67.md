Grade: 6.5

## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidtâ€™s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

According to this model, System 1 plays a primary role in moral decision making because our initial response is emotional, and moral reasoning follows to support that emotional reaction rather than influence it. System 1 operates quickly and effortlessly, producing an immediate emotional response, whereas System 2 is slower and more deliberate, with rational thinking occurring first and the emotional reaction coming later.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 involves emotional responses in moral judgment, which aligns with the answer key's requirement that System 1 refers to intuitions/emotion.
- Incorrect: The student describes System 2 as slower and more deliberate but incorrectly states that 'rational thinking occurs first and the emotional reaction comes later,' which contradicts their earlier correct statement and the answer key that System 2 refers to reasoning/rational thought.
- Correct: The student clearly states that System 1 'plays a primary role in moral decision making' and that 'moral reasoning follows to support that emotional reaction rather than influence it,' correctly identifying System 1 as dominant.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

This heuristic, known as the representative heuristic, refers to the tendency to assign specific traits to, for example, a particular occupation without taking into account the overall prevalence or likelihood of that occupation within the population. Since there are relatively few fashion models in the population, this outcome is unlikely.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive bias in this scenario.
- Incorrect: While the student mentions base rates and population prevalence, they don't explain the core mechanism of the representativeness heuristic - that we judge likelihood based on how much someone resembles the stereotype of a category (fashion model stereotype).

Score: 0.5

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring refers to the idea that the initial information we receive (such as a price for T-shirts) acts as a reference point for all subsequent information. A higher price creates a higher reference point. The primacy effect means that the first information shown to us (and also the last, though that is less relevant here) tends to be the most memorable. Both concepts emphasize the significance of the first piece of information we encounter.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as using the first piece of information as a reference point, which aligns with the answer key's description of it being a starting point.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as the first information being most memorable, which matches the answer key's definition of better remembering the first piece of information.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both concepts emphasize the significance of the first piece of information encountered, which corresponds to the answer key's point about overreliance on first information.

Score: 1.0

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency to prefer avoiding losses, while risk aversion involves a preference for avoiding uncertainty. The distinction is that someone may take on risks when trying to prevent a loss.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion refers to the tendency to prefer avoiding losses, which captures the core concept from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes risk aversion as a preference for avoiding uncertainty, which aligns with the answer key's definition of preferring certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 1.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias refers to the tendency to exaggerate the emotional effect a single event will have on us in the future while undervaluing the influence of other factors and experiences. This can lead individuals to avoid ending relationships because they believe the breakup will have a greater impact on their lives and cause more suffering than it actually will.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies impact bias as overestimating the emotional impact of future events, which aligns with the answer key's definition of overestimating the impact on future feelings.
- Correct: The student accurately explains how impact bias prevents breakups by describing that people believe the breakup will cause more suffering than it actually will, which matches the answer key's point about overestimating how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting refers to our general difficulty in accurately anticipating how we will feel in the future. This is crucial to keep in mind when making end-of-life choices, as it can significantly distort our expectations and planning, potentially resulting in unfavorable or misguided decisions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies affective forecasting as predictions about future emotional states, though they phrase it as 'difficulty in accurately anticipating how we will feel' which captures the same concept.
- Incorrect: While the student mentions that affective forecasting can distort expectations in end-of-life decisions, they don't provide the specific example from the answer key about healthy people predicting they'd prefer to die when sick, but then not actually preferring to die when they become sick.

Score: 0.5

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

Prospect theory suggests that individuals tend to perceive very low probabilities as if they are impossible, meaning they believe such events cannot occur, while they view high probabilities as guaranteed or safe. As a result, a 0.01% chance is seen as impossible, whereas a 10% chance is merely considered a low probability without extra significance.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student states that 10% probabilities are viewed 'without extra significance' but fails to mention that prospect theory indicates people actually overestimate merely low probabilities like 10%.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that extremely low probabilities (0.01%) are perceived as impossible according to prospect theory.

Score: 0.5

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion is very effective because we are strongly driven to attain gains and avoid losses. It ranks highly on both the value function and the weighting function. This concept represents our inclination to safeguard what we possess and avoid losing our belongings.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's answer does not correctly explain loss aversion in terms of utility. The answer key requires explaining that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities or that the value function is steeper for losses than gains. The student's response describes general behavioral tendencies and mentions both value and weighting functions without specifically addressing the asymmetric weighting of losses versus gains in utility terms.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory suggests choosing the option that yields the greatest gains over time. Expected utility theory states that the most rational choice is the one offering the highest utility. However, both approaches have significant drawbacks since people are rarely fully rational.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes what both theories suggest but does not address the key difference that expected value theory deals only with financial values while expected utility theory deals with non-financial values as well.
- Incorrect: The student mentions that both approaches have drawbacks due to people not being fully rational, but fails to identify that expected utility theory specifically considers risk aversion while expected value theory does not consider heuristics and biases.

Score: 0.0

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesnâ€™t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Gain-framed refers to situations where there is a potential to gain something, which tends to increase loss aversion. Loss-framed means there is a risk of losing something, which encourages risk-seeking behavior. When neither loss nor gain is framed, it implies there is no possibility of losing or gaining anything, similar to a fair gamble. When both loss and gain are framed, meaning there is a chance to both lose and gain, the loss tends to carry more significance, leading to risk-seeking behavior.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student discusses gain-framing and loss-framing concepts but does not mention expected value theory, which is about choosing between options with financial outcomes and probabilities.
- Incorrect: The student does not identify or explain expected utility theory, which extends expected value theory to include subjective utilities beyond just financial outcomes.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention multi-attribute utility theory, which involves choosing between options with multiple attributes, each having utility and weight.
- Incorrect: While the student discusses loss aversion and framing effects which are related to prospect theory, they do not explicitly identify prospect theory as a descriptive behavioral model or properly explain its relationship to expected utility theory with heuristics and biases.

Score: 0.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease peopleâ€™s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Individuals are highly driven to avoid losses and may become risk-seeking to prevent them. This creates a contradiction: as loss aversion grows stronger, it reduces risk-averse behavior to the point where people may actually take on more risks.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion can make people risk-seeking when trying to avoid losses, and accurately describes how this reduces risk-averse behavior, which aligns with the key point that loss aversion can decrease risk aversion and make people risk seeking.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning is a type of learning. Classical conditioning involves pairing a neutral stimulus (such as a bell) with an unconditioned stimulus (like food) to produce a conditioned response (such as salivation). This process relies on repeated associations. Operant conditioning, on the other hand, shapes behavior through the use of rewards to promote actions and punishments to discourage them.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as a type of learning, which aligns with the answer key's definition of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as involving pairing stimuli and repeated associations, which matches the answer key's concept of learning to associate things that happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as shaping behavior through rewards and punishments, which directly corresponds to the answer key's definition of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation refers to perceiving a cause-and-effect link when there is merely a correlation or association present, while illusory correlation involves noticing a correlation that is actually influenced by a third factor or mediator.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly identifies that illusory causation involves perceiving causation when only correlation exists, but incorrectly defines illusory correlation as being influenced by a third factor rather than perceiving correlation where none actually exists between the two variables.

Score: 0.0

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to â€˜properlyâ€™ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

A schema, like "how the Dutch health care system works," is a general framework, whereas a script, such as "how to behave properly at a birthday party," is a cultural or social construct that likely varies across different cultures. Unlike the script, the schema is not confined to a specific cultural setting.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that understanding the Dutch healthcare system is a schema and provides a reasonable explanation that it represents a general framework of knowledge, which aligns with the answer key's point about schemas corresponding to knowledge and relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script and explains it as a cultural/social construct that varies across cultures, which demonstrates understanding that scripts are situation-specific behavioral guidelines as indicated in the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

They use a basic level of analysis by concentrating solely on behavior and its immediate triggers, while ignoring other factors. Since the human mind is far more intricate, behaviorism offers only a simple and limited perspective.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student does not correctly identify the physical stance as the behaviorist approach according to Dennett's framework. Instead, they describe a 'basic level of analysis' without using Dennett's terminology. Additionally, the student focuses on criticizing behaviorism's limitations rather than explaining why behaviorists adopted the physical stance (focusing on stimulus-response processes).

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

Evolutionary psychologists operate at a more advanced level of analysis by considering some of the world's complexity in their examinations.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student does not identify the design stance as the correct answer. They vaguely mention 'advanced level of analysis' and 'complexity' but fail to recognize that evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance because they analyze psychological processes in terms of their function and purpose.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Temporal order means the cause must occur before the event. Contiguity in space and time means the two events must happen close together in both time and location. Stability over time means the effect is not just a single occurrence but remains consistent over a period. Ruling out different explanations means being able to control for alternative causes. A logical relationship means that the idea of A causing B must make sense to some degree.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: Student mentions 'ruling out different explanations' which relates to distinctness/specificity, but doesn't clearly articulate that B should follow A but not other events.
- Incorrect: Student mentions 'stability over time' which is related to consistency, but doesn't clearly state that B should always follow A.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies 'logical relationship' which corresponds to plausibility - that A causing B must make sense.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies 'contiguity in space and time' and explains it as events happening close together in time and location.
- Incorrect: Student does not mention similarity in cause and effect as a heuristic for judging causation.

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Negativity bias means we are naturally drawn to and look for negative information. The availability heuristic refers to how we assess the probability of an event based on how easily it comes to mind. Together, these concepts explain why we are attracted to moral outrage: it is negative news, and because we frequently encounter it (even though itâ€™s actually rare), we mistakenly believe that moral outrage occurs more often than it does.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines negativity bias as the tendency to be drawn to and look for negative information, which aligns with the answer key's definition of seeking out or placing more weight on negative information.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the availability heuristic as assessing probability based on how easily something comes to mind, which matches the answer key's definition of estimating frequency based on ease of recall.
- Correct: The student successfully explains the connection between the two biases - that negativity bias draws us to moral outrage content, making it frequently encountered and easily recalled, which through availability heuristic leads to overestimating its frequency.

Score: 1.0

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

This is known as the law of contagion. However, I cannot interpret it through the lens of framework theories across various fields of knowledge. Superstition cannot be explained by physics, psychology, or biology.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly identifies the law of contagion but fails to explain it in terms of framework theories. The answer key requires explaining how biological domain concepts (contagion) are incorrectly applied to social/psychological domains. The student dismisses the possibility of such cross-domain explanations rather than analyzing the misapplication of biological frameworks to social situations.

Score: 0.0

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A delusion refers to a belief that is not accepted by the culture. Thus, a conspiracy theory that is accepted by the culture is not considered delusional, while one that is rejected is viewed as delusional.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student only addresses the cultural acceptance criterion but omits the equally important requirement that a delusional conspiracy theory must also be an irrational belief. The answer key specifies both conditions: irrational belief AND not commonly accepted.

Score: 0.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

Inclination to believe in magical contagion or superstitions. Lower intelligence. Propensity to simplify complex matters excessively. Inclination to be distrustful.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student mentions 'inclination to believe in magical contagion or superstitions' which aligns with 'believing paranormal phenomena' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'lower intelligence' which directly matches 'having a low level of intelligence' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student mentions 'propensity to simplify complex matters excessively' which corresponds to 'believing in simple explanations for complex events' from the answer key.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you donâ€™t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Belief perseverance refers to the difficulty of changing existing beliefs, which continue to affect us despite being disproven. The continued influence effect means that misinformation, once corrected, still remains in our minds and continues to impact us.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the continued-influence effect as a mechanism where misinformation continues to impact us even after correction, which directly applies to how incorrect quiz answers can interfere with learning the correct information later. This matches the alternative answer provided in the key.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

The mere exposure effect explains that we are more likely to favor things we encounter frequently. As a result, repeating a message can make it more attractive, and to some extent, help us remember it better through learning.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the mere exposure effect as the psychological mechanism and accurately explains that frequent exposure leads to increased preference/attractiveness, which directly answers the question.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

I believe it does. While 'unrealistic optimism' refers to the tendency of individuals (like myself) to assume they are less likely to face negative events, major depressive disorder skews these expectations toward the negative, making them less accurate.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that major depressive disorder makes people less accurate at predictions by skewing expectations toward the negative. The answer key indicates that people with depression are actually more accurate because they show reduced unrealistic optimism, not that they become overly pessimistic and thus less accurate.

Score: 0.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

The impact of existing beliefs on how we perceive things becomes stronger!

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that prior beliefs have a stronger influence on perception when sensory reliability decreases, which matches the key concept from the answer key.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You donâ€™t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other peopleâ€™s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

Kohlberg's three stages of moral development are: 1. Preconventional, 2. Conventional, and 3. Postconventional. The preconventional stage involves following rules mainly to avoid punishment and gain benefits, acting out of self-interest. The conventional stage involves adhering to rules to be seen as a good person, gain approval, and uphold social order and justice. The postconventional stage involves pursuing higher principles such as human rights and following personal moral guidelines, which can occasionally conflict with established laws.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the preconventional level and accurately describes it as following rules to avoid punishment and gain benefits/rewards, which matches the answer key's focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the conventional level and describes it as adhering to rules to gain approval and uphold social order, which aligns with the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the postconventional level and describes it as pursuing higher principles like human rights and following personal moral guidelines, which matches the answer key's focus on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

The causal model of past events explains that we tend to create logical narratives in our minds about what happened before. These narratives make the results seem inevitable. Hindsight bias is further intensified because we cannot remember our previous judgments or predictions accurately and must reconstruct our memories, which changes them. As a result, we believe the actual outcome was the only possible one, even though it wasnâ€™t.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a causal model involves creating logical narratives about past events, which aligns with the answer key's definition of a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that these narratives make results seem inevitable and connects this to hindsight bias, matching the answer key's point about events seeming more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias.

Score: 1.0

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Knowing the real outcome of an event leads to hindsight bias because it is more readily and quickly recalled than imagined alternative outcomes that did not occur. Our awareness of the actual result affects our judgment since we find it difficult to disregard this information when evaluating the situation. Thus, acquiring knowledge of the outcome promotes hindsight bias.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that newly learned information (knowledge of the actual outcome) cannot be avoided when making retrospective judgments, which aligns with the key concept that learning contributes to hindsight bias by making it difficult to disregard new information when estimating past likelihood judgments.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Individuals who score high in neuroticism tend to be maximizers. This decision-making style is linked to experiencing choice overload and regret, as maximizers aim to consider every option to make the optimal decision. In contrast, satisficers settle for what is adequate and do not worry excessively about other alternatives.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student does not explicitly define maximizing as 'trying to make the best choice' but instead describes it indirectly through its effects and characteristics.
- Correct: The student correctly describes satisficing as settling for what is adequate and not worrying about other alternatives, which captures the 'good-enough choice' concept.
- Correct: The student correctly states that individuals who score high in neuroticism tend to be maximizers, directly answering the question about the relationship between neuroticism and decision style.

Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

I would place more emphasis on assignments. I really liked the assignment in the thinking and deciding course, and I would aim to make it smaller but spread out over weekly intervals. This way, students would need to engage with the assignments every week and have the freedom to decide how much effort to put in. The work would be tied to specific gradesâ€”for example, completing 5 out of 8 assignments would earn a 6, while 6 out of 8 would earn a 6.5. This approach promotes intrinsic motivation and reduces the pressure of exams.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement by proposing a specific, well-thought-out solution involving regular weekly assignments with flexible grading thresholds. They reference their personal experience from the course, explain how their approach would promote engagement while being resource-efficient, and address the key constraint of limited time/resources by using standardized grading criteria rather than personalized feedback.

Score: 1.0
