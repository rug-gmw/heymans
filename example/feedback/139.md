## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

System 1 operates through intuition, whereas System 2 relies on logical reasoning. This model suggests that System 1 is more prevalent because the world’s complexity makes extensive rational thinking impractical, leading individuals to depend more on intuitive thought.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 operates through intuition, which aligns with the answer key's requirement that System 1 refers to intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student accurately describes System 2 as relying on logical reasoning, which matches the answer key's description of System 2 as reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student clearly states that System 1 is more prevalent and provides reasoning for this dominance, satisfying the answer key's requirement that System 1 thinking is more dominant than System 2.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

It is representative heuristics, a mental shortcut where we categorize something based on how closely it resembles a typical example of that category. Even without having a complete understanding or definition, we assume it belongs to that category because of these similarities.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process, though they write 'representative heuristics' instead of 'representativeness heuristic'.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that this heuristic involves categorizing based on resemblance to typical examples/stereotypes of a category, which matches the core concept in the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring refers to how our perception shifts and adjusts based on new information, influencing our original judgment or value of something. The primacy effect describes how the first impression significantly shapes our overall perception of something. Both effects share the commonality of strongly influencing how we adapt and perceive ourselves.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes anchoring as perception shifting based on new information, but the correct definition is the tendency to use the first piece of information as a starting point for judgments.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that the primacy effect involves first impressions significantly shaping overall perception, which aligns with better remembering first information.
- Incorrect: The student states both effects influence how we 'adapt and perceive ourselves,' but the correct commonality is that both involve overreliance on the first piece of information.

Score: 0.3333333333333333

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency of individuals to steer clear of losses, whereas risk aversion describes the inclination to avoid significant risks.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes loss aversion as 'tendency to steer clear of losses' which misses the key concept that losses are weighted more heavily than equivalent gains. The answer doesn't capture the asymmetric valuation between losses and gains.
- Incorrect: The student defines risk aversion as 'inclination to avoid significant risks' which is incomplete. The answer key specifies preference for certainty over uncertainty, but the student's answer only mentions avoiding 'significant' risks, missing the broader concept of preferring certainty.

Score: 0.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias refers to the common tendency for individuals to exaggerate the emotional effects of their choices. This bias can influence situations like breakups because people anticipate feeling worse than they actually will, causing fear of those emotions even before experiencing them, which may lead them to decide against ending the relationship.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies impact bias as the tendency to exaggerate emotional effects of choices, which aligns with overestimating the impact of future events on feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly explains that impact bias prevents breakups because people anticipate feeling worse than they actually will, which matches the answer key's point about overestimating how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting refers to the way people predict they will experience the life they desire in the future. It is significant because it provides a clear indication of our emotions and aspirations as we approach the end of our lives.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student defines affective forecasting as predicting 'the life they desire in the future' rather than predictions about future emotional states. This misses the key concept that it's specifically about forecasting emotions/feelings.
- Incorrect: The student discusses general emotions and aspirations at end of life, but completely misses the specific phenomenon where healthy people's predictions about preferring death when sick often don't match their actual preferences when they become ill.

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

The theory suggests that individuals often overrate the likelihood of rare events. To some degree, this overestimation persists because of a fear of taking risks.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that prospect theory suggests people overestimate low probabilities, referring to 'overrating the likelihood of rare events' which aligns with the answer key point about overestimating merely low probabilities.
- Incorrect: The student does not address the distinction between merely low probabilities and extremely low probabilities, nor do they mention that extremely low probabilities are often treated as impossibilities.

Score: 0.5

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

minimizing the greatest possible losses one might experience, both in terms of assets and personal connections.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's answer describes a general risk management strategy rather than explaining loss aversion in prospect theory. Loss aversion specifically refers to the asymmetric weighting of losses versus gains in the utility function, where losses are felt more intensely than equivalent gains, not about minimizing potential losses.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory is based on precise economic calculations and does not depend on heuristics or biases. In contrast, expected utility theory incorporates some heuristics and places particular emphasis on biases, acknowledging the influence of cultural emotions.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student does not mention the key distinction that expected value theory deals only with financial values while expected utility theory deals with both financial and non-financial values.
- Incorrect: While the student correctly identifies that expected value theory does not consider heuristics/biases, they incorrectly describe expected utility theory as incorporating 'heuristics' and 'cultural emotions' rather than specifically addressing risk aversion as stated in the answer key.

Score: 0.0

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected value theory emphasizes the significance of the value assigned to each possible outcome in decision-making. However, it is challenging to apply due to its reliance on complex calculations and mental effort. While effective in economic contexts, it does not account for people's emotions or behaviors. Expected choice theory focuses on the likelihood of making appropriate decisions, helping to explain moral and rational judgments by assessing which options are suitable. Expected utility theory resembles expected value theory but incorporates emotions, beliefs, and some heuristics, although it still falls short in fully explaining human behavior and emotions. Expected choice utility theory combines elements of choice and utility theories while considering heuristics and biases, making it more effective in explaining people's behavior.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions expected value theory but incorrectly describes it as emphasizing 'value assigned to outcomes' rather than focusing on financial outcomes with probabilities. The description lacks the key concept of probability-weighted financial outcomes.
- Incorrect: The student introduces 'Expected choice theory' which is not one of the four models from the answer key. This appears to be a confusion or invention rather than addressing expected utility theory correctly.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention multi-attribute utility theory at all. Instead, they discuss expected utility theory but with an incomplete description that doesn't clearly distinguish it from expected value theory.
- Incorrect: The student mentions 'Expected choice utility theory' which is not prospect theory. While they correctly identify heuristics and biases as relevant, they fail to identify this as prospect theory or describe it as a descriptive/behavioral model.

Score: 0.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Loss aversion influences behavior because people generally steer clear of certain risks and therefore do not encounter them, although occasionally they may actively pursue those risks.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's answer is vague and doesn't clearly connect loss aversion to risk aversion. It mentions people 'steer clear of certain risks' but fails to explain that loss aversion can actually make people willing to accept risk to avoid losses, potentially making them risk-seeking rather than risk-averse.

Score: 0.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning is a form of learning in which an individual becomes better adjusted to a specific situation through repeated exposure and experience. Classical conditioning involves adapting based on previous experiences and interactions that are regularly observed and felt. Operant conditioning is similar to classical conditioning but also includes the use of rewards and punishments.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes conditioning as 'becoming better adjusted through repeated exposure' rather than learning associations through covariation. This misses the key concept of associative learning.
- Incorrect: The student mentions 'adapting based on previous experiences that are regularly observed' but fails to capture the core concept of learning associations when two things happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that operant conditioning involves rewards and punishments, which aligns with the answer key's description of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 0.3333333333333333

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation occurs when individuals think that one event caused an outcome, whereas illusory correlation happens when people assume a relationship between two experiences even though there is no proof supporting it.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that illusory causation involves incorrectly attributing causation (thinking one event caused an outcome) and illusory correlation involves perceiving relationships that don't actually exist (assuming relationships without proof). While the wording differs from the answer key, the core conceptual understanding is accurate.

Score: 1.0

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

Comprehending the healthcare system is considered a schema because it relies on a specific context and variations; here, it’s crucial to recognize why the Dutch healthcare system differs and what information is essential. In contrast, behaving correctly at a birthday party is a script, as the term implies—people must learn the proper conduct expected at a birthday party by adhering to culturally established routines.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the healthcare system as a schema and provides a reasonable explanation about it involving knowledge of differences and essential information, which aligns with schemas being knowledge structures about relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies birthday party behavior as a script and explains it involves learning proper conduct through culturally established routines, which matches the concept of scripts as behavioral sequences for specific situations.

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

In terms of relevance, we naturally connect with people who share our interests and human traits, which leads us to form ingroups and outgroups based on our beliefs.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student completely misses the question about Daniel Dennett's stances/levels of analysis. Instead of identifying that evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function, the student provides a general explanation about ingroup formation that doesn't address Dennett's framework at all.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Correlation bias is the inclination of individuals to believe that one event is connected to another or that something causes an event, even when there is no evidence supporting this connection. This bias commonly occurs because people often quickly assume a relationship between events. Availability heuristics refer to the mental shortcut where people assess a situation based on examples that are readily recalled. This heuristic serves as a foundation for making judgments, as we rely on past experiences and easily remembered examples to evaluate the relationship between events.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student discusses correlation bias but does not mention distinctness/specificity as a heuristic for judging causation.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention consistency as a heuristic for determining causation.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention plausibility as a heuristic for judging causation.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention contiguity in time and space as a heuristic for determining causation.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention similarity in cause and effect as a heuristic for judging causation.

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Negativity bias is a form of bias where emotions gradually influence a person's perception, often through negative emotions, which can interfere with their decision-making and how they interpret situations.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student provides a vague and incorrect definition of negativity bias, describing it as emotions influencing perception rather than the tendency to seek out or place more weight on negative information.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention the availability heuristic at all, which is one of the two key biases required by the question.
- Incorrect: The student fails to explain how these biases work together to cause overestimation of moral outrage on social media, providing no connection between the concepts and the specific phenomenon described in the question.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

We decide not to like this individual, and this decision turns into a belief that serves as a mental image or guideline, leading us to avoid any future connection with them. These beliefs become part of what we know about the person, causing us to steer clear of them and potentially resulting in biases.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's answer describes psychological processes of dislike and avoidance but fails to identify the key concept of domain-inappropriate application of biological contagion principles to social situations. The answer does not mention framework theories, different domains of knowledge, or how biological contagion concepts are misapplied to non-biological contexts.

Score: 0.0

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A delusional conspiracy theory relies on false beliefs, making it hard for people with differing views to accept because of its ridiculous nature. In contrast, a non-delusional conspiracy theory is typically based on rumors that are not entirely implausible and remain somewhat believable within the context of real-world events.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student focuses on plausibility and believability but misses the key distinction from the answer key. The answer key specifies that a conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief AND not commonly accepted, while the student discusses false beliefs and implausibility without addressing the 'commonly accepted' criterion that differentiates delusional from non-delusional conspiracy theories.

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

False beliefs, convictions, ethics.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: False beliefs is too vague and doesn't match any specific cognitive/personality factor from the answer key like pattern recognition in randomness or paranormal beliefs.
- Incorrect: Convictions is not a specific cognitive or personality factor mentioned in the answer key and is too general compared to factors like narcissism or low analytical thinking.
- Incorrect: Ethics is not listed as one of the cognitive/personality factors in the answer key and doesn't correspond to any of the specific factors like agency attribution or intelligence level.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Hindsight bias occurs when we believe we knew the correct answer all along, but after giving a wrong answer and then learning the right one, we convince ourselves that we had an inkling of the correct response even though we couldn't express it at the time.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes hindsight bias, which is about believing you knew something all along after learning the outcome. However, the question asks about how incorrect answers interfere with learning, and the answer key focuses on source amnesia (forgetting that your answer was incorrect) or proactive interference (old incorrect information interfering with new correct information). Hindsight bias doesn't explain the interference mechanism described in the question.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

Inclinations toward propaganda.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The answer 'inclinations toward propaganda' does not identify the specific psychological mechanism of mere exposure effect or illusory-truth effect. While propaganda may involve repetition, the student has not named the correct psychological principle that explains why repetition makes messages more attractive.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Yes, this could be because they were influenced by negativity bias, which was reinforced by their reliance on availability heuristics.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states 'Yes' when the correct answer is 'No' - people with major depressive disorder are MORE accurate, not less accurate. Additionally, the explanation about negativity bias and availability heuristics does not address the key concept that depression reduces overly optimistic predictions, making depressed individuals more realistic rather than less accurate.

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

It serves as a reference point for our perception, altering the way we perceive things.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's answer is too vague and doesn't address the key concept. While they mention that prior beliefs serve as a reference point and alter perception, they fail to explain what happens when sensory reliability decreases - specifically that prior beliefs have increased influence when sensory information is unreliable.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

The three aspects of moral development are moral intuition, moral cognition, and moral judgment. Moral intuition refers to an understanding of morality shaped by personal experiences and beliefs. Moral cognition involves the capacity to identify moral principles and determine which moral actions are suitable. Moral judgment is the skill of evaluating situations using one's own moral knowledge.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes 'moral intuition' focused on personal experiences and beliefs, which does not match the pre-conventional level's focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Incorrect: The student describes 'moral cognition' as identifying moral principles and suitable actions, which does not match the conventional level's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Incorrect: The student describes 'moral judgment' as evaluating situations using personal moral knowledge, which does not match the post-conventional level's focus on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model is an explanation that people often think something caused their event or experience, even if there isn’t a strong correlation between them. It contributes to hindsight bias by influencing people's availability heuristics, leading them to believe they predicted the cause of an event after it occurs, even though they hadn’t considered it beforehand.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly defines a causal model as relating to weak correlations and personal experiences, rather than understanding it as a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly explains the contribution to hindsight bias through availability heuristics and prediction beliefs, missing the key point that causal models make events seem more inevitable than they actually were.

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

It is challenging for a person to disregard new information and not relate it to past events and their own mental shortcuts, which leads to hindsight bias.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people cannot disregard newly learned information when evaluating past events, which is the core mechanism of how learning contributes to hindsight bias. The answer captures the essential concept that new knowledge interferes with accurate recall of past likelihood judgments.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing involves trying to find the best possible option, whereas satisficing means selecting an option that is good enough. They would prefer the maximizing approach.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as trying to find the best possible option, which aligns with the answer key's description of 'trying to make the best choice'.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as selecting an option that is good enough, which matches the answer key's definition of 'making a good-enough choice'.
- Incorrect: The student states 'they would prefer the maximizing approach' but fails to specify that this refers to someone high in neuroticism, making the connection unclear and incomplete.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

I think it is better in this situation to use resources and time efficiently by creating a study system for students that minimizes mental strain and prevents overstimulation. This approach should aim to reduce excessive cognitive demands in the learning environment. Feedback can be provided through group discussions rather than individual sessions, and grading can be supported by automated computer-based systems.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement with the question by proposing a coherent approach that addresses the constraints mentioned (limited time and resources). They suggest specific solutions including efficient resource use, group discussions for feedback, and automated grading systems, while also considering cognitive load theory principles to minimize mental strain. The answer shows thoughtful consideration of practical teaching challenges.
