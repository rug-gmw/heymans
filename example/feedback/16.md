Grade: 10.0

## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

System 1 represents intuitive thinking, and Haidt suggests that moral judgments stem from these intuitions, which are essentially social emotions. This system plays the primary role in Haidt's social intuitionist model. On the other hand, System 2 involves deliberate, rational thought. While it can modify our moral intuitions, it does so only in certain circumstances.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies System 1 as intuitive thinking and connects it to emotions ('social emotions'), which aligns with the answer key's requirement that System 1 refers to intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student accurately describes System 2 as involving 'deliberate, rational thought,' which matches the answer key's definition of System 2 as reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student clearly states that System 1 'plays the primary role in Haidt's social intuitionist model' and that System 2 can only modify intuitions 'in certain circumstances,' indicating System 1's dominance over System 2.

Score: 1.0

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

Representativeness heuristic: we estimate the likelihood that something belongs to a particular category by how closely it resembles a typical member of that category. For example, if your coworker looks like the ideal image of a supermodel, you might assume your coworker is probably a supermodel.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process in this scenario.
- Correct: The student provides an accurate explanation of the representativeness heuristic, describing how we estimate likelihood of category membership based on resemblance to typical category members, and gives a relevant example that demonstrates understanding of the concept.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring means that the initial information acts as a reference point. Subsequent information is used to modify this initial reference, but the adjustments are usually inadequate. The primacy effect highlights that we are especially influenced by the first pieces of information we receive. Both concepts share the idea that early information holds more weight than information encountered afterward.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as using initial information as a reference point, which aligns with the answer key's description of taking the first piece of information as the starting point.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as being especially influenced by first pieces of information, which corresponds to the answer key's point about better remembering the first piece of information.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both concepts share the common feature of giving more weight to early/first information, which matches the answer key's point about overreliance on the first piece of information.

Score: 1.0

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion means that we tend to feel the impact of losses more strongly than that of equivalent gains. Risk aversion indicates our preference for certainty instead of uncertainty, leading us to shy away from risky situations.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly explains that loss aversion means feeling the impact of losses more strongly than equivalent gains, which matches the answer key's definition of weighing losses more heavily than gains.
- Correct: The student accurately defines risk aversion as preferring certainty over uncertainty and avoiding risky situations, which aligns with the answer key's definition of preferring certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 1.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias refers to the tendency to exaggerate how much future events will affect our emotions. This can stop people from ending relationships because they anticipate feeling lonelier or sadder than they actually will, despite currently being unhappy.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as the tendency to exaggerate how much future events will affect our emotions, which matches the answer key's definition of overestimating the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly explains that impact bias prevents breakups because people anticipate feeling worse (lonelier or sadder) than they actually will, which aligns with the answer key's point about overestimating how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves anticipating how we will feel in the future. People tend to be inaccurate at this. Therefore, it is important to remember that individuals may make different decisions about their end-of-life care when they are healthy compared to the choices they would make when actually experiencing illness, a phenomenon known as the disability paradox.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines affective forecasting as anticipating how we will feel in the future, which matches the answer key's definition of predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Correct: The student accurately captures the key concept that healthy people may make different end-of-life decisions than when actually sick, demonstrating understanding of why affective forecasting is important in this context, even using the term 'disability paradox' to describe this phenomenon.

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

Small probabilities tend to be given too much weight and therefore overvalued. This is different because very low probabilities may be perceived as impossible.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that small probabilities are overweighted/overvalued, which aligns with the answer key point that merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Correct: The student correctly distinguishes that very low probabilities may be perceived as impossible, which matches the answer key point about extremely low probabilities being interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency to place greater importance on losses than on equivalent gains. It results in a negative impact on utility.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion means losses are weighed more heavily than equivalent gains, which aligns with the answer key's description of negative utilities being weighed more heavily than positive utilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

The first distinction is that expected value theory deals exclusively with financial outcomes measured in monetary terms, whereas expected utility theory can incorporate subjective preferences for different options. The second distinction is that expected utility theory takes into account an individual's risk aversion.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory deals with financial/monetary outcomes while expected utility theory incorporates subjective preferences, which aligns with the answer key's distinction between financial and non-financial values.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected utility theory considers risk aversion, which matches the answer key's point about expected utility theory considering risk aversion while expected value theory does not consider heuristics and biases.

Score: 1.0

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected value theory is a normative model for decision-making that involves selecting between different options, each associated with various financial outcomes and their probabilities. Expected utility theory is similar but extends beyond financial outcomes to include subjective ones and also accounts for risk aversion. In this model, each option has utilities and probabilities that may be subjective rather than purely financial. Multiple attribute utility theory is another primarily normative model where each option is evaluated based on several attributes, each with assigned utilities and weights. Prospect theory, on the other hand, is a descriptive model of decision-making that builds on expected utility theory but also incorporates heuristics and biases into the decision process.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as a normative model for choosing between options with financial outcomes and probabilities, matching the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes expected utility theory as similar to expected value theory but extending to subjective outcomes beyond financial ones, and mentions risk aversion which aligns with the utility concept in the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies multi-attribute utility theory as a normative model where options have multiple attributes with utilities and weights, matching the answer key description.
- Correct: The student accurately describes prospect theory as a descriptive model that builds on expected utility theory while incorporating heuristics and biases, which aligns with the answer key's description of it being descriptive/behavioral.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency to value losses more than equivalent gains. As a result, individuals often become risk-averse, choosing to avoid losses even when there is a possibility of gaining an equal amount.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that loss aversion makes people risk-averse. The answer key indicates that loss aversion actually decreases risk aversion and can make people risk-seeking when trying to avoid losses. The student misunderstands the directional relationship between loss aversion and risk preferences.

Score: 0.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves learning connections through the occurrence of events together. Classical conditioning occurs when we associate two events that frequently happen at the same time. Operant conditioning involves understanding that our behaviors can lead to positive or negative consequences.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as learning connections/associations through events occurring together, which aligns with the key concept of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as associating two events that frequently happen at the same time, which matches the answer key's description of learning to associate things that happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as understanding that behaviors lead to positive or negative consequences, which corresponds to the answer key's point about learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation refers to the tendency to perceive a cause-and-effect relationship in correlations that are present but not truly causal. Illusory correlation, on the other hand, involves perceiving correlations that are actually nonexistent. The key distinction is that illusory causation involves an actual correlation, whereas illusory correlation does not.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that illusory causation involves misinterpreting an actual correlation as causal, while illusory correlation involves perceiving correlations that don't actually exist. This matches the answer key's distinction between incorrectly interpreting correlation as causation versus perceiving non-existent correlations.

Score: 1.0

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

A schema represents understanding by organizing knowledge, such as theories and perspectives, as connections between ideas. Schemas assist us in understanding scenarios and responding suitably. The structure of the Dutch healthcare system serves as a schema, fitting this definition. A script is a type of social schema that pertains to familiar situations and varies across cultures. For example, the expected behavior at a birthday party is a script, since it involves a typical social event influenced by cultural norms.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the Dutch healthcare system as a schema and provides accurate reasoning, explaining that schemas organize knowledge as connections between ideas and help in understanding scenarios.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies birthday party behavior as a script and provides proper justification, explaining that scripts are social schemas for familiar situations that vary across cultures.

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

The intentional stance is employed to clarify purposeful thoughts and actions.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the intentional stance instead of the physical stance. Behaviorists rejected mental concepts like thoughts and purposes, focusing instead on observable stimulus-response relationships, which aligns with the physical stance that examines mechanical processes rather than intentional explanations.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

The design stance focuses on how things work, while evolutionary psychology is grounded in the usefulness or function of specific traits or behaviors.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that evolutionary psychology adopts the design stance and provides accurate reasoning by explaining that the design stance focuses on function/usefulness, which aligns with evolutionary psychology's approach of analyzing psychological processes in terms of their adaptive functions.

Score: 1.0

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Specificity: When event A occurs, event B follows, with no other factors causing B. Consistency: Every time A happens, B happens. Plausibility: Given what I know about event B, it makes sense that A causes B. Contiguity in time and place: B begins immediately after A occurs, and when A stops, B stops as well. Similarity in cause and effect: When A moves and impacts B, B begins to move too.

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies specificity and explains it as B following A with no other factors causing B, which captures the essence of distinctness/specificity from the answer key.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies consistency and explains it as 'every time A happens, B happens,' which matches the answer key's definition perfectly.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies plausibility and explains it as making sense that A causes B given knowledge about B, which aligns with the common sense aspect from the answer key.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies contiguity in time and place, explaining temporal sequence and cessation patterns, which demonstrates understanding of the spatial-temporal relationship concept.
- Incorrect: Student's explanation focuses on physical movement and impact rather than superficial resemblance between cause and effect, missing the key concept of similarity in appearance or characteristics.

Score: 0.8

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

The availability heuristic suggests that we judge how often something occurs or its likelihood based on how easily related examples or memories come to us. Negativity bias means we tend to focus on negative information. On social media, because of this bias, we pay more attention to negative content, making it more readily accessible in our minds (availability heuristic). As a result, we incorrectly perceive that a larger number of people are morally outraged on social media than is actually the case.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines negativity bias as the tendency to focus on negative information, which aligns with the answer key's description of seeking out or placing more weight on negative information.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the availability heuristic as judging frequency or likelihood based on how easily examples or memories come to mind, matching the answer key definition.
- Correct: The student effectively explains the connection between the two biases: negativity bias causes attention to negative content on social media, making it more accessible in memory, which through availability heuristic leads to overestimating moral outrage frequency.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

Transferring concepts from one area to a different one can lead to superstitions, such as in the example of magical contagion. Similarly, when you avoid using something belonging to someone you dislike, you are extending an idea from one realm (emotional dislike) to another (physical avoidance due to a belief the item is "contaminated").

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that magical contagion involves the inappropriate transfer of concepts between domains - specifically extending biological/contamination concepts from one realm (emotional/social dislike) to another realm (physical objects), demonstrating understanding of how framework theories from different domains can be misapplied.

Score: 1.0

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

A delusional conspiracy theory is not embraced by culture and is not commonly believed, whereas a valid conspiracy can be both true and widely accepted.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that delusional conspiracy theories are not commonly accepted/believed, and implicitly captures the irrationality aspect by contrasting with 'valid' conspiracies that 'can be true', showing understanding of the rational/irrational distinction.

Score: 1.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

- Detecting order in chaos - Exhibiting narcissistic traits - Assigning intent where there is none.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'detecting order in chaos' which corresponds to 'seeing patterns in randomness' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'exhibiting narcissistic traits' which directly matches 'being narcissistic' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'assigning intent where there is none' which corresponds to 'attributing agency where it does not exist' from the answer key.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Source amnesia refers to our tendency to forget the circumstances or context in which we acquired certain information.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies source amnesia as forgetting the circumstances or context of information acquisition, which directly relates to how one might forget that their quiz answer was incorrect and later mistake it for the correct answer.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

Mere exposure heuristic: we tend to favor things we encounter often, including beliefs we come across regularly.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the mere exposure effect (calling it 'mere exposure heuristic') and accurately explains that it involves favoring things we encounter frequently, including beliefs. This demonstrates understanding of the psychological mechanism politicians use when repeating statements.

Score: 1.0

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) lack a positivity bias, which normally causes people to underestimate the chances of negative events occurring. Therefore, people with MDD do not make less accurate predictions compared to those without the disorder.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people with MDD are more accurate at predicting negative events because they lack the positivity bias (optimism bias) that typically causes people to underestimate risks. This demonstrates understanding that MDD does not make people less accurate - in fact, it makes them more realistic in their predictions.

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

As reliability diminishes, perception relies more heavily on prior belief, making the prior belief have a greater influence on perception.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when sensory reliability decreases, prior beliefs have greater influence on perception, which directly matches the key concept from the answer key.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

Pre-conventional stage: Good behavior is driven by the desire for rewards, while bad behavior is avoided to prevent punishment. This stage emphasizes self-interest with minimal concern for mutual exchange. Conventional stage: Morality is based on gaining approval from others and adhering to laws, with an emphasis on considering others' feelings. Post-conventional stage: An understanding that moral principles may sometimes clash, prioritizing broader, more inherent ethical values.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the pre-conventional level as focusing on rewards and avoiding punishment, which aligns with the answer key's description of obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as emphasizing gaining approval from others, adhering to laws, and considering others' feelings, which matches the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly describes the post-conventional level as prioritizing broader, inherent ethical values and understanding that moral principles may clash, which aligns with the answer key's focus on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model means that we naturally create logical stories about what did happen, rather than what might have happened but didn’t. This tendency makes it easier to focus on actual events, which in turn fuels hindsight bias.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a causal model involves creating logical stories/narratives about past events, which aligns with the answer key's definition of 'coherent narrative of how past events are related.'
- Correct: The student accurately explains how causal models contribute to hindsight bias by making people focus on what actually happened rather than alternative possibilities, which effectively captures how events seem more inevitable in retrospect.

Score: 1.0

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

When evaluating previous likelihood estimates, we inevitably incorporate information we have acquired since then (known as the curse of knowledge). This leads to hindsight bias, as we use this new information—which was unavailable at the time of the original judgment—and convince ourselves that we predicted the outcome all along.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly explains that when estimating past likelihood judgments, newly learned information cannot be avoided and is inevitably incorporated. They also correctly identify this phenomenon as the curse of knowledge and explain how this leads to hindsight bias by using information that was unavailable during the original judgment.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing involves selecting the optimal option, while satisficing means choosing an option that is sufficiently good. Individuals who score high in neuroticism are more likely to be maximizers.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as selecting the optimal option, which aligns with the answer key's description of 'trying to make the best choice.'
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as choosing an option that is sufficiently good, which matches the answer key's definition of 'making a good-enough choice.'
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that individuals high in neuroticism are more likely to be maximizers, which directly matches the answer key's statement.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

I would handle this by delivering weekly lectures during the available time and requiring students to complete a compulsory multiple-choice quiz each week on Brightspace to ensure they stay on top of the readings. At the conclusion of the course, I would administer a multiple-choice or short open-answer exam graded by AI. This approach minimizes my grading workload and resource use.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement by providing a concrete, practical approach that directly addresses the constraints mentioned (limited time and resources). They propose specific solutions including weekly lectures, compulsory quizzes, and AI-assisted grading that would realistically minimize grading workload while maintaining student engagement with course material.
