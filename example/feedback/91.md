## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

System 1 operates initially and depends on intuition, forming moral judgments through feelings rather than reasoning. After a while, System 2 activates, using logical and careful thought to make moral decisions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 operates through intuition and feelings, which aligns with the answer key's requirement that System 1 refers to intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 2 uses logical and careful thought, which matches the answer key's requirement that System 2 refers to reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Incorrect: The student does not explicitly state which system is more dominant according to Haidt's model. While they mention System 1 operates 'initially,' they don't clearly indicate that System 1 is more dominant overall than System 2.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

This is known as the representativeness heuristic, where individuals estimate the likelihood or frequency of something belonging to a category based on how closely it resembles that category.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive mechanism in this scenario.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that the representativeness heuristic involves estimating likelihood of category membership based on resemblance to that category, which matches the key concept in the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring refers to the phenomenon where initial information heavily influences one's impression. Similarly, the primacy effect occurs when the first pieces of information significantly shape the overall impression. Both concepts impact how impressions are formed.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as being influenced by initial information, which aligns with the answer key's description of taking the first piece of information as a starting point.
- Incorrect: The student describes the primacy effect as shaping overall impressions rather than specifically about better remembering the first piece of information, missing the memory component that distinguishes it from anchoring.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both concepts involve the impact of first/initial information on impressions, which corresponds to overreliance on first information as stated in the answer key.

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion encourages risky behavior, whereas risk aversion does not.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly describes loss aversion as encouraging risky behavior, missing the key concept that loss aversion is about weighing losses more heavily than equivalent gains.
- Incorrect: The student fails to define risk aversion as the preference for certainty over uncertainty, instead only stating what it does not do.

Score: 0.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias occurs when individuals exaggerate the intensity of their future emotional reactions. This can stop people from ending relationships, as they anticipate feeling more sadness or stress from a breakup than they actually will.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as exaggerating the intensity of future emotional reactions, which aligns with the answer key's definition of overestimating the impact of future events on future feelings.
- Correct: The student accurately explains how impact bias prevents breakups by stating people anticipate feeling more sadness or stress than they actually will, which matches the answer key's point about overestimating how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting refers to the process of anticipating our future emotions and feelings. It is crucial to take this into account because making choices about end-of-life care before experiencing serious health issues tends to result in different decisions—often leaning more towards end-of-life options—than when one is actually living with conditions like Alzheimer's or dementia. This phenomenon is also known as the disability paradox.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines affective forecasting as anticipating future emotions and feelings, which aligns with the answer key's definition of predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Correct: The student accurately captures the key concept that healthy people make different end-of-life decisions than when actually experiencing illness, specifically noting they lean more towards end-of-life options when healthy, which matches the answer key's point about preferring to die when healthy but not when actually sick.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

People tend to underestimate low probabilities, with a noticeable difference between low and very low probabilities. Extremely low probabilities are significantly underestimated.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student states that low probabilities are underestimated, but according to prospect theory, merely low probabilities (like 10%) are actually overestimated, not underestimated.
- Incorrect: While the student correctly identifies that extremely low probabilities are treated differently, they describe them as 'significantly underestimated' rather than being treated as impossibilities or ignored entirely.

Score: 0.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

it indicates a loss in value

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The answer is too vague and doesn't capture the key concept that loss aversion means negative utilities are weighted more heavily than positive utilities, or that the value function is steeper for losses than gains.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

1: Expected utility theory takes into account non-monetary outcomes, whereas expected value theory does not. 2: Expected utility theory incorporates loss aversion.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected utility theory considers non-monetary outcomes while expected value theory focuses only on monetary/financial values. This matches the first key point.
- Incorrect: The student mentions loss aversion, but the answer key specifically refers to risk aversion. While both are behavioral concepts, loss aversion is a different phenomenon than risk aversion, so this doesn't fully satisfy the second key point.

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

1: Expected value theory is a normative framework that forecasts economic or financial choices. 2: Expected utility theory is also a normative model similar to expected value theory, but it includes non-monetary decisions and accounts for loss aversion. 3: Multi-attribute utility theory, a normative approach akin to expected utility theory, evaluates multiple factors and applies to more intricate decisions. 4: Prospect theory is a descriptive model resembling expected utility theory but integrates heuristics and cognitive biases.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as a normative model for economic/financial choices, capturing the key concept of probabilistic financial outcomes.
- Incorrect: While the student correctly identifies expected utility theory as normative and mentions non-monetary decisions, they incorrectly attribute loss aversion to this theory. Loss aversion is actually a concept from prospect theory, not expected utility theory.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies multi-attribute utility theory as a normative model that evaluates multiple factors/attributes for complex decisions, which aligns with the answer key's description of multiple attributes with utilities and weights.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies prospect theory as a descriptive model that incorporates heuristics and cognitive biases, which matches the answer key's characterization as a behavioral model with heuristics and biases.

Score: 0.75

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Loss aversion generates a perception that losses can be prevented, leading individuals to engage in risk-taking behavior, making them behave contrary to being risk-averse.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion leads to risk-taking behavior that contradicts typical risk aversion. They understand that people will take risks to avoid losses, which aligns with the key point that loss aversion can decrease risk aversion and make people risk-seeking.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning is the process of learning through the association of events that occur together. Operant conditioning uses rewards or punishments to influence behavior, whereas classical conditioning does not.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as learning through association of events, which aligns with the answer key's definition of learning associations through covariation.
- Incorrect: The student does not explain classical conditioning as learning when two things happen together in time and space, only mentioning that it doesn't use rewards or punishments.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies operant conditioning as using rewards or punishments to influence behavior, which matches the answer key's concept of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory correlation occurs when individuals perceive a relationship between two variables that doesn't actually exist, while illusory causation happens when people believe one event causes another despite no real causal link.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly distinguishes between illusory correlation (perceiving a relationship that doesn't exist) and illusory causation (believing in a causal link that doesn't exist). While the wording differs from the answer key, the student demonstrates understanding of both concepts and their fundamental difference.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

Knowing how the Dutch healthcare system operates is an example of a schema, while knowing the appropriate behavior at a party is an example of a script. A script is a type of social schema that relates to a familiar scenario. Here, the individual takes information gained from a schema and applies it to a typical event, such as attending a party.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that understanding the Dutch healthcare system is a schema and provides appropriate reasoning that it involves knowledge and relationships, though expressed as 'how it operates' rather than explicit mention of knowledge structures.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that knowing appropriate behavior at a party is a script and accurately explains that a script is a type of social schema for familiar scenarios, demonstrating understanding of the situational behavioral aspect.

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

They chose the physical stance because they aim to examine behavior by focusing on physical characteristics.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that behaviorists adopted the physical stance and provides an appropriate justification that they focused on physical characteristics, which aligns with the answer key's emphasis on behaviorists focusing on the processes that caused stimuli to result in behavior.

Score: 1.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

They take a design perspective by examining the usefulness of elements in their design according to their functions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance and provides an accurate explanation that they examine elements according to their functions, which aligns with the answer key's emphasis on considering psychological processes in terms of their function.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Distinctness: Event B occurs exclusively when event A takes place. Consistency: Event A invariably leads to event B. Probability: Events A and B occur simultaneously. Contiguity in space and time: Event A brings about event B, and it is the sole cause of event B. Normality in the sequence of events: Event A happens first, followed by event B.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies distinctness and explains it as event B occurring exclusively when event A takes place, which matches the answer key's concept of B following A but not other events.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies consistency and explains it as event A invariably leading to event B, which aligns with the answer key's definition of B always following A.
- Incorrect: The student confuses plausibility with probability and describes it as simultaneous occurrence, which is incorrect. Plausibility refers to common sense making it reasonable that A causes B.
- Incorrect: The student misunderstands contiguity in time and space, describing it as A being the sole cause of B rather than A and B occurring at the same time and location.
- Incorrect: The student mentions 'normality in the sequence of events' which is not one of the five heuristics. The missing heuristic is similarity in cause and effect, where A and B superficially resemble each other.

Score: 0.4

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

confirmation bias: We often focus on online examples of people expressing moral outrage and overlook information that contradicts this view. recency bias: When we have recently encountered many instances of moral outrage online, we are inclined to believe that such behavior is widespread.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student identified confirmation bias instead of negativity bias. While confirmation bias involves seeking information that confirms existing beliefs, the answer key specifically requires negativity bias, which is about giving more weight to negative information generally.
- Incorrect: The student identified recency bias instead of availability heuristic. Although recency bias is related to recent experiences, the answer key requires availability heuristic, which is about estimating frequency based on ease of recall, not just recent exposure.
- Incorrect: The student did not explain the connection between the two biases as required by the answer key. The key point about negativity bias increasing examples which then feeds into availability heuristic to cause overestimation is missing.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

When we dislike a person, we often perceive anything connected to them negatively. This reflects a type of superstition, where we link two separate situations as if they were related.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes the phenomenon as superstition and negative perception but fails to identify the key framework theory concept: that biological domain knowledge (contagion) is being incorrectly applied to the social/psychological domain. The answer lacks the specific domain transfer explanation required by the answer key.

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

the extent to which the conspiracy theory is believed

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's answer only mentions belief extent but misses the key distinction that a delusional conspiracy theory requires both irrational belief AND lack of common acceptance, not just the degree to which it is believed.

Score: 0.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

1: hostile 2: commanding 3: a mental disorder characterized by distorted thinking and perceptions

Feedback:

- Incorrect: Being 'hostile' is not mentioned in the answer key as a cognitive or personality factor contributing to conspiratorial thinking.
- Incorrect: Being 'commanding' is not listed in the answer key as a factor contributing to conspiratorial thinking.
- Incorrect: While this describes a mental health condition, it does not match any of the specific cognitive and personality factors from the answer key such as pattern recognition, paranormal beliefs, or narcissism.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

as a result of the knowledge curse effect

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions 'knowledge curse effect' which is not the correct psychological mechanism. The answer key specifies source amnesia, proactive interference, or continued-influence effect as the mechanisms by which incorrect answers interfere with learning, not the curse of knowledge.

Score: 0.0

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

the tendency to favor information that confirms one's preexisting beliefs or ideas

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student described confirmation bias, which is about favoring information that confirms existing beliefs. This is incorrect - the question asks about making messages more attractive through repetition, which is explained by mere exposure effect or illusory-truth effect, not confirmation bias.

Score: 0.0

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Major depressive disorder frequently causes individuals to lose their natural positivity bias. As a result, they no longer downplay the chances of negative events occurring to them. In fact, they may even have a tendency to overestimate the likelihood of something bad happening.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that major depressive disorder reduces positivity bias and leads to more accurate (less overly optimistic) predictions about negative events. While they mention potential overestimation, the core concept that depression makes people more accurate by reducing excessive optimism is captured.

Score: 1.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

Previous beliefs have a stronger effect on perception and may lead to a skewed understanding.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that prior beliefs have a stronger effect on perception when sensory information is unreliable, and mentions the consequence of skewed understanding, which aligns with the key concept that perception becomes increasingly influenced by expectations rather than sensory data.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

Pre-conventional: A self-centered stage lacking much empathy, focused on mutual benefit. Conventional: A stage characterized by empathy and mutual understanding. Post-conventional: A stage involving a deeper awareness of others' perspectives and an effort to recognize and overcome personal biases and blind spots.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes pre-conventional as 'self-centered' and 'focused on mutual benefit' but misses the key aspect of obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. The description doesn't capture the punishment/reward orientation that defines this level.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the conventional level as characterized by empathy and mutual understanding, which aligns with the focus on social norms and other people's feelings from the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student describes post-conventional as involving awareness of others' perspectives and overcoming biases, but this doesn't capture the key element of abstract principles and values that defines this level according to Kohlberg's theory.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model is an explanatory framework that illustrates how individuals typically remember past events. For instance, people often struggle to accurately recall information and create precise representations, which can lead to incorrect conclusions about past occurrences and result in hindsight bias.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes a causal model as an 'explanatory framework' for how people remember events, but misses the key concept that it's specifically a coherent narrative of how past events are related to each other.
- Incorrect: While the student mentions that causal models can lead to hindsight bias, they don't explain the crucial mechanism - that events within a causal model seem more inevitable than they actually were, which is what specifically contributes to hindsight bias.

Score: 0.0

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

We inevitably absorb new information as it comes. When an event occurs and we become aware of it, this fresh knowledge stays prominent in our memory and is accessed via the availability heuristic, leading us to think that we predicted it all along.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that newly learned information cannot be avoided when estimating past judgments, which is the core mechanism of hindsight bias. While they use different terminology (availability heuristic instead of curse of knowledge), they accurately describe how fresh knowledge influences our retrospective assessments and makes us believe we 'predicted it all along.'

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing involves striving to make the optimal choice, while satisficing involves settling for a decision that is good enough. Individuals with high levels of neuroticism are more likely to engage in maximizing.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as 'striving to make the optimal choice' which aligns with the answer key's 'trying to make the best choice'.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as 'settling for a decision that is good enough' which matches the answer key's 'making a good-enough choice'.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that individuals with high neuroticism are more likely to engage in maximizing, which matches the answer key's statement about adopting the maximizing decision style.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

I would implement peer feedback for both evaluation and grading purposes. Students would be divided into groups and assigned various questions related to the material, such as practice problems from each topic in the book or lectures. Each student would first answer the questions on their own, then share their responses within the group until a consensus on the correct answers is reached. This process ensures that each topic is thoroughly reviewed and understood by all.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement by proposing a specific, well-thought-out solution (peer feedback and group consensus) that directly addresses the constraints mentioned in the question (limited time and resources, need for scalable assessment). The approach shows understanding of collaborative learning principles and provides concrete implementation details.
