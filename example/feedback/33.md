## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

System 1 operates quickly and often unconsciously, whereas System 2 functions in a deliberate and rule-based manner with conscious effort. The social intuitionist model suggests that because there is an overwhelming amount of information to process, we cannot rely solely on System 2, so System 1 is utilized more frequently.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes System 1 as operating quickly and unconsciously but does not explicitly identify it as intuitions or emotions in the context of moral judgment.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies System 2 as deliberate and rule-based with conscious effort, which aligns with reasoning/rational thought.
- Correct: The student correctly states that System 1 is utilized more frequently than System 2, indicating System 1's dominance in the model.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

Representativeness heuristic = because the colleague fits the typical image of a fashion model, we conclude that they are a fashion model.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process in this scenario.
- Correct: The student demonstrates understanding of how the representativeness heuristic works by explaining that judgments are made based on how well someone fits the typical image or stereotype of a category.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring occurs when an initial number or piece of information serves as a reference point for making a judgment. The primacy effect means that information presented first has a greater impact than information shown afterward. Because of the primacy effect, the first piece of information often becomes the anchor.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as using initial information as a reference point for judgment, which aligns with the answer key's definition of taking the first piece of information as the starting point.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as first information having greater impact than later information, which corresponds to the answer key's point about better remembering first information.
- Correct: The student explicitly connects both concepts by stating that first information becomes the anchor due to primacy effect, demonstrating understanding of their common overreliance on first information.

Score: 1.0

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

In loss aversion, the focus is on reducing losses and increasing risk, while in risk aversion, the preference is for options that offer certainty instead of taking risks.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that loss aversion involves 'increasing risk' and focuses on 'reducing losses', missing the key concept that loss aversion is about weighing losses more heavily than equivalent gains.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that risk aversion involves preferring certainty over taking risks, which aligns with the answer key's definition of preferring certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 0.5

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias happens when we expect an event to affect us more deeply than it actually does. This bias can lead individuals to think that ending a relationship will be emotionally harder than staying in an unhappy one.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies impact bias as overestimating how much an event will affect us, which matches the key concept of overestimating the impact of future events on our feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly explains that impact bias prevents breakups by making people think ending the relationship will be emotionally harder than it actually would be, which aligns with overestimating how bad a breakup will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting involves anticipating how a future event will impact your emotions. It plays a crucial role in end-of-life decisions, helping individuals decide what actions to take when they enter end-of-life care.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies affective forecasting as predicting future emotional states, though they phrase it as 'anticipating how a future event will impact your emotions' rather than specifically mentioning predictions about one's own future emotional state.
- Incorrect: The student mentions that affective forecasting helps in end-of-life decisions but fails to explain the key concept that healthy people may predict they'll prefer to die when sick, but actually may not prefer to die when they become sick.

Score: 0.5

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

People often dismiss very low and extremely low probabilities by considering them impossible.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student does not mention that merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) are often overestimated, only discussing dismissal of probabilities.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that extremely low probabilities are often treated as impossibilities or dismissed.

Score: 0.5

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency of individuals to prefer avoiding losses rather than acquiring equivalent gains.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes loss aversion as a behavioral tendency but does not explain how this is reflected in utility terms within prospect theory, specifically that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities or that the value function is steeper for losses than gains.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected utility theory considers the personal preferences or satisfaction (utility) associated with a choice, whereas expected value theory focuses solely on the numerical outcome.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory focuses on numerical/financial outcomes while expected utility theory incorporates personal preferences and satisfaction, which aligns with the distinction between financial vs non-financial values.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention the key difference regarding heuristics, biases, and risk aversion that distinguishes expected utility theory from expected value theory.

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected utility theory involves selecting the option with the greatest combined objective and subjective value. Expected value theory chooses the option that offers the most advantageous result based on probability. Multi-attribute utility theory involves making decisions by evaluating several different factors. Prospect theory focuses on decision-making under risk by assessing the potential outcomes of various prospects.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student confuses expected value and expected utility theory. Expected value theory should focus on financial outcomes with probabilities, but the student describes it as choosing the most advantageous result based on probability without mentioning the financial aspect.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected utility theory involves combined objective and subjective value, which aligns with the key point that outcomes have utility that can be subjective, not just financial.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that multi-attribute utility theory involves evaluating several different factors, which corresponds to the answer key's mention of multiple attributes with utilities and weights.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies prospect theory as focusing on decision-making under risk and assessing potential outcomes, which aligns with it being a descriptive behavioral model, though they don't explicitly mention heuristics and biases.

Score: 0.75

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Loss aversion increases risk aversion because individuals aim to avoid losses. As a result, they avoid taking risks that might cause a loss, even if those risks also offer potential gains.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that loss aversion increases risk aversion. According to the answer key, loss aversion actually decreases risk aversion and can make people risk-seeking when facing potential losses, as people become willing to accept risk to avoid losses.

Score: 0.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning is the process of learning connections through events happening together. Classical conditioning involves learning by noticing two things happening at the same time, which creates a link between them. Operant conditioning involves learning that certain behaviors produce specific outcomes.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as learning connections/associations through events happening together, which aligns with the key concept of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as learning by noticing two things happening at the same time and creating links between them, which matches the answer key's description of associating things that happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning that behaviors produce specific outcomes, which corresponds to the answer key's point about learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation occurs when individuals perceive a cause-and-effect link that isn't actually present, while illusory correlation happens when people notice a connection between two events that doesn't truly exist.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that illusory causation involves perceiving a causal relationship that doesn't exist, and illusory correlation involves perceiving a correlation that doesn't exist. While the wording differs from the answer key, the core distinction is accurate - one is about false causation and the other is about false correlation.

Score: 1.0

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

A script is a collection of general knowledge for a very common event, while a schema is a collection of general knowledge for a particular situation. For example, a birthday party represents a script, whereas the Dutch healthcare system represents a schema.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the Dutch healthcare system as a schema based on the wrong reasoning. While the conclusion is correct, they define schema as 'general knowledge for a particular situation' rather than knowledge and relationships between things/concepts.
- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies birthday party behavior as a script but provides an inadequate definition. They define script as 'general knowledge for a very common event' rather than understanding it as a social schema describing behavioral sequences in specific situations.

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

The behavioral perspective explains an action based on its purpose or role. By examining what an action does, behaviorists can analyze how a stimulus triggers a response.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies behaviorism with the functional stance (explaining actions by purpose/role) rather than the physical stance. Behaviorists focused on measurable stimulus-response mechanisms and physical processes, not on the purpose or function of behaviors.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

The intentional stance involves assigning mental characteristics to an entity. By identifying the purpose behind a behavior, we can trace the development of a species' mental traits.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the intentional stance instead of the design stance. While they mention identifying purpose behind behavior, they focus on mental characteristics and tracing mental traits rather than understanding that evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance because they analyze psychological processes in terms of their adaptive function.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Direct = my cat makes a purring sound when I pet it. Continuous in time and space = my cat consistently purrs whenever I pet it. Plausible = my cat has the ability to purr. Specific = only my cat purrs when I pet it. Falsifiable = my cat won’t purr if I don’t pet it.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: Student mentions 'Specific' but doesn't correctly explain distinctness/specificity. The explanation about 'only my cat purrs when I pet it' misses the key concept that B should follow A but not other events.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies consistency with 'Continuous in time and space = my cat consistently purrs whenever I pet it', showing understanding that B always follows A.
- Correct: Student correctly identifies plausibility with 'my cat has the ability to purr', demonstrating understanding that common sense supports the causal relationship.
- Incorrect: Student mentions 'Continuous in time and space' but conflates it with consistency. They don't explain the actual concept of temporal and spatial proximity between cause and effect.
- Incorrect: Student mentions 'Falsifiable' and 'Direct' which are not among the five heuristics from the answer key. They miss the similarity in cause and effect heuristic entirely.

Score: 0.4

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Increased exposure occurs because social media's algorithms repeatedly show us the same information. Source amnesia refers to our tendency to forget the origin of the information. As we continuously encounter the same moral outrage from different sources, we lose track of its source, making it seem widespread.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student does not identify the negativity bias. Instead, they discuss algorithmic exposure and source amnesia, which are not the biases specified in the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student does not identify the availability heuristic. They mention repeated exposure and source amnesia but fail to recognize how ease of recall influences probability estimates.
- Incorrect: The student does not explain the correct mechanism linking negativity bias and availability heuristic. Their explanation focuses on algorithmic repetition and source confusion rather than how negativity bias feeds into availability heuristic.

Score: 0.0

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

Framework theories are fundamental knowledge structures that help us interpret the world. People frequently link characteristics of a negative stimulus to a neutral stimulus, even when such associations are illogical.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes general principles about framework theories and stimulus associations but fails to identify the specific cross-domain application that defines magical contagion - that biological contagion concepts are incorrectly applied to social/psychological domains where physical contamination rules don't actually apply.

Score: 0.0

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

Delusions are beliefs that lack reason, whereas a conspiracy theory that is not delusional can be logical.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student only addresses the rationality aspect (irrational belief) but fails to mention the second key criterion that the belief must also not be commonly accepted to be considered delusional. The distinction requires both conditions to be met.

Score: 0.0

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

1. Groups that are inadequately represented 2. Persistence of beliefs 3. Searching for reasons behind events that cannot be explained

Feedback:

- Incorrect: Groups that are inadequately represented does not match any of the cognitive and personality factors listed in the answer key such as seeing patterns in randomness, paranormal beliefs, or narcissism.
- Incorrect: Persistence of beliefs is not specifically mentioned in the answer key factors, which focus on cognitive biases like pattern recognition and personality traits rather than belief persistence.
- Correct: Searching for reasons behind events that cannot be explained relates to attributing agency where it does not exist, which is one of the factors listed in the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Continuous influence refers to the difficulty of correcting incorrect information with new facts, even when belief perseverance is not involved.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the continued-influence effect (though they call it 'continuous influence') as a mechanism by which incorrect answers can interfere with learning. This aligns with the answer key's mention of the continued-influence effect as an alternative answer, and the student demonstrates understanding that incorrect information persists and interferes with correction attempts.

Score: 1.0

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

Increased exposure leads us to be more likely to accept information that we recognize.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that increased exposure leads to greater acceptance of familiar information, which captures the essence of both the mere exposure effect and the illusory-truth effect mentioned in the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Yes, major depressive disorders are influenced by the negativity bias, which drives individuals to focus on negative emotional events in their daily lives.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that major depressive disorder makes people less accurate at predictions due to negativity bias. The correct answer is that people with depression are actually MORE accurate because they have reduced optimism bias, not that they are less accurate due to focusing on negative events.

Score: 0.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

Previous beliefs have a greater influence on decision making because less sensory information is utilized.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that prior beliefs have greater influence when sensory information is less reliable, demonstrating understanding of the core concept from the ideal-observer model.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

Pre-cognitive: moral behavior is viewed in terms of punishment and reward. Cognitive: moral behavior is understood as following social norms. Post-cognitive: moral behavior is regarded as a matter of morality itself.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the pre-conventional level as focusing on punishment and reward, which matches the answer key's description of obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as following social norms, which aligns with the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student describes the post-conventional level as focusing on 'morality itself,' which captures the essence of abstract principles and values mentioned in the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model is a logical explanation of the events that took place. We frequently rely on causal models to reconstruct parts of an event we can't recall, because knowing the outcome makes related information easier to access, leading us to use that accessible knowledge to fill in the missing details of our causal model.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies a causal model as a logical explanation of events, which aligns with the answer key's description of a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Incorrect: While the student describes how causal models work in memory reconstruction, they do not explicitly connect this to hindsight bias or explain how causal models make events seem more inevitable than they actually were.

Score: 0.5

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Because of the curse of knowledge, we are unable to ignore the new information we acquire, as we unconsciously revise our beliefs, which results in hindsight bias.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that newly learned information cannot be ignored when estimating past likelihood judgments, mentions the curse of knowledge by name, and explains how this unconscious revision of beliefs leads to hindsight bias. This fully addresses the key point about how learning contributes to hindsight bias.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing refers to a decision-making approach where one seeks the best possible choice. Satisficing involves selecting an option that is sufficiently satisfactory. People who are neurotic tend to be more inclined toward maximizing.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as seeking the best possible choice, which aligns with the answer key's definition of 'trying to make the best choice.'
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as selecting an option that is sufficiently satisfactory, which matches the answer key's definition of 'making a good-enough choice.'
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that neurotic people tend to be more inclined toward maximizing, which matches the answer key's statement about high neuroticism being associated with the maximizing decision style.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

Increasing the number of tests, such as including both midterm and final exams, could enable the instructor to create shorter, more focused assessments that may encourage greater student involvement. Additionally, using multiple-choice exams can help ensure fair grading, as they reduce issues related to ambiguous wording and interpretation.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement by proposing concrete solutions (increasing test frequency, shorter focused assessments, multiple-choice format) that directly address the constraints mentioned in the question (limited time and resources, need for non-personalized grading). The answer shows understanding of how assessment design can promote student engagement while being practical to implement.
