## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

The social-intuitionist model suggests that moral judgments arise from intuition, emotions, and instinctive feelings rather than from deliberate reasoning and rational thought. Consequently, system 2 thinking is not the primary driver in this model.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that moral judgments arise from intuition, emotions, and instinctive feelings, which corresponds to System 1 thinking in the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that deliberate reasoning and rational thought (System 2) are not the primary driver, implicitly acknowledging the role of System 2 thinking.
- Correct: The student clearly states that System 2 thinking is not the primary driver, which indicates that System 1 (intuition/emotion) is more dominant, satisfying the dominance requirement.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

The Representative Heuristic refers to our tendency to categorize something based on its resemblance to other items within that category. In other words, if X resembles Y, we assume X is Y. For example, if a colleague appears like a model, we presume they are one.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process, though they spell it as 'Representative Heuristic' rather than 'representativeness heuristic'.
- Correct: The student accurately explains the heuristic as categorizing based on resemblance to stereotypes within a category, and provides the exact example from the question to demonstrate understanding.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

The primacy effect suggests that the initial impression remains in your memory and has a stronger impact on your overall perception of a person or event. Anchoring demonstrates how this first impression significantly shapes your overall opinion or position on an issue, outweighing information received afterward. Both concepts illustrate how early information greatly affects your general impression or belief.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes anchoring in terms of impressions and opinions rather than as a cognitive bias where the first piece of information serves as a starting point for subsequent judgments and decisions.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that the primacy effect involves initial information having a stronger impact and remaining in memory, which aligns with better remembering the first piece of information.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both concepts involve early/first information having disproportionate influence, which demonstrates understanding of their common overreliance on initial information.

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency of individuals to avoid a particular loss or situations that might lead to an undesirable loss. Risk aversion, on the other hand, describes the behavior of people who seek to steer clear of potential risks.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes loss aversion as avoiding losses in general, but misses the key concept that losses are weighted more heavily than equivalent gains. The answer doesn't capture the asymmetric valuation between losses and gains.
- Incorrect: The student describes risk aversion as avoiding 'potential risks' which is too vague. The answer key specifically defines risk aversion as preferring certainty over uncertainty, which is more precise than just avoiding risks.

Score: 0.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias refers to the tendency of individuals to overestimate how strongly an event will affect them emotionally. This bias can lead people to be excessively afraid of the pain or loneliness they might experience after a breakup, even if the relationship isn’t fulfilling, and as a result, they may avoid ending the relationship due to the fear of those anticipated feelings.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as the tendency to overestimate how strongly an event will affect them emotionally, which aligns with the answer key's definition of overestimating the impact of future events on future feelings.
- Correct: The student accurately explains how impact bias prevents breakups by describing that people become 'excessively afraid of the pain or loneliness' and avoid ending relationships due to 'fear of those anticipated feelings,' which matches the answer key's point about overestimating how bad a breakup will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting refers to the process of anticipating how we will feel in the future. It involves estimating our upcoming emotions or moods. However, we often struggle to accurately predict how long and how strongly we will experience these feelings. This concept is crucial in making end-of-life choices because, despite believing we understand our future emotions, we frequently do not.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines affective forecasting as predicting future emotional states, though they add extra detail about duration and intensity that isn't required by the answer key.
- Incorrect: While the student mentions that affective forecasting is important for end-of-life decisions and that we struggle with accuracy, they don't specifically address the key point that healthy people may predict preferring death when sick, but actually prefer to live when they become sick.

Score: 0.5

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

People tend to exaggerate the likelihood of unlikely events while believing that very rare events cannot happen.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people 'exaggerate the likelihood of unlikely events,' which corresponds to overestimating merely low probabilities.
- Correct: The student accurately states that people believe 'very rare events cannot happen,' which aligns with the answer key point that extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion describes the tendency of individuals to give greater importance to small losses. Losses or scenarios involving possible loss are viewed as having negative value.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly identifies that losses have negative value and are given greater importance, but fails to specify the key comparative aspect - that losses are weighed more heavily than equivalent gains. The answer lacks the crucial comparison between negative and positive utilities or the steepness difference in the value function.

Score: 0.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory focuses on financial results, whereas utility theory does not. Additionally, expected value theory assigns weights to various financial outcomes in a more objective manner, while the weights used in expected utility are subjective.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory focuses on financial results while expected utility theory does not, which aligns with the answer key point about financial vs. non-financial values.
- Incorrect: The student discusses objective vs. subjective weighting but misses the key point about risk aversion and heuristics/biases that distinguish expected utility theory from expected value theory.

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected Value Theory is a normative framework outlining how individuals should make economic choices, assuming rational decision-making. Expected Utility Theory, also normative, posits that people select the option with the greatest expected utility, again based on the assumption of consistent rationality. Multi-Attribute Utility Theory also takes a normative approach but evaluates choices involving multiple attributes, assigning weights and utilities to each, offering a more detailed perspective than expected utility theory while still relying on expected utility values. Prospect Theory builds on utility theory by incorporating cognitive biases and heuristics, based on three key ideas: people evaluate outcomes in terms of gains and losses rather than absolute values, they systematically misestimate utility, and they consistently misinterpret probabilities.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies Expected Value Theory as a normative model for economic/rational decision-making, which aligns with the answer key's description of it being a normative model for choosing between options with probabilistic financial outcomes.
- Correct: The student accurately describes Expected Utility Theory as a normative model where people select options with greatest expected utility based on rational assumptions, which matches the answer key's explanation that it's like expected value theory but with subjective utility outcomes.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies Multi-Attribute Utility Theory as a normative approach that evaluates choices with multiple attributes and assigns weights and utilities to each, which directly corresponds to the answer key's description.
- Correct: The student accurately describes Prospect Theory as building on utility theory while incorporating cognitive biases and heuristics, and mentions key concepts like gains/losses evaluation, which aligns with the answer key's description of it being a descriptive/behavioral model that considers heuristics and biases.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

When individuals attempt to prevent losses, they may become more willing to take risks (less risk-averse) as they pursue drastic actions to escape the anticipated loss. These drastic actions often involve inherent risks.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion can make people less risk-averse or even risk-seeking when trying to avoid losses. They understand that people will take on risks to prevent losses, which matches the key concept that loss aversion decreases risk aversion in loss domains.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning involves learning to link a stimulus with a particular event. Classical conditioning occurs when individuals associate a stimulus with an event, while operant conditioning happens when individuals (or animals) learn through the use of rewards and punishments.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as a form of learning that involves linking/associating stimuli with events, which aligns with the concept of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as associating a stimulus with an event, which matches the answer key's description of learning to associate things that happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning through rewards and punishments, which directly corresponds to the answer key's point about learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation occurs when we mistakenly believe that a correlation implies a cause-and-effect connection, while illusory correlations involve incorrectly linking two unrelated factors.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly distinguishes between illusory causation (mistakenly interpreting correlation as causation) and illusory correlation (perceiving connections between unrelated/uncorrelated variables). The explanation captures the core difference accurately.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

The first example is a schema, offering general background information about how particular situations, systems, or environments usually operate. The second example is a script, as it outlines the specific rules for a particular setting or interaction, such as a Dutch birthday party.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the Dutch healthcare system as a schema and provides an appropriate explanation that it represents general background knowledge about how systems operate, which aligns with the concept of schemas as knowledge structures about relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies birthday party behavior as a script and explains it as specific rules for a particular setting/interaction, which matches the answer key's description of scripts as social schemas describing situation-specific behavior.

Score: 1.0

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

This approach, known as the intentional stance, interprets actions by considering the agent's beliefs and desires (intentions).

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies behaviorism with the intentional stance. Behaviorism actually adopted the physical stance because it focused on observable stimulus-response mechanisms rather than beliefs, desires, or mental states. The intentional stance involves attributing beliefs and desires to explain behavior, which is exactly what behaviorists rejected.

Score: 0.0

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

This approach follows the design stance by trying to explain psychological processes in terms of their practical usefulness. Essentially, it seeks to clarify the functional benefits (such as survival or evolutionary advantages) behind why people act the way they do.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance and provides accurate reasoning - they explain that this approach considers psychological processes in terms of their practical usefulness and functional benefits, which aligns with the design stance's focus on function and purpose.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Causal heuristics are clear and specific, indicating that A causes B rather than other factors. They are believable because it seems reasonable that A leads to B. They are reliable, meaning A causing B is not a random or isolated event. There is a connection in time and place, with A happening shortly before B and in roughly the same location. Additionally, A and B share similarities in their nature or characteristics.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies distinctness/specificity by stating that causal heuristics should be 'clear and specific, indicating that A causes B rather than other factors.'
- Correct: The student captures consistency by describing it as 'reliable, meaning A causing B is not a random or isolated event,' which aligns with the concept that B always follows A.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies plausibility by stating the heuristics are 'believable because it seems reasonable that A leads to B,' matching the common sense requirement.
- Correct: The student accurately describes contiguity in time and space as 'A happening shortly before B and in roughly the same location.'
- Correct: The student correctly identifies similarity in cause and effect by noting that 'A and B share similarities in their nature or characteristics.'

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Negativity bias and the availability heuristic combine to make us think that a greater number of people are morally outraged. We are naturally drawn to negative information and often look for it. When negative content is more easily recalled from our memory, it influences our perception of reality. As a result, these two biases lead us to overestimate how many people are genuinely morally outraged.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias and explains that we are naturally drawn to and seek out negative information, which aligns with the answer key's definition.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the availability heuristic and explains that easily recalled content influences our perception of reality, which matches the answer key's concept of estimating frequency based on ease of recall.
- Correct: The student successfully explains how these two biases work together - negativity bias draws us to negative content, making it more easily recalled, which then leads to overestimating moral outrage frequency.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

The concept of energy or essence moving from one entity to another is also observed in framework theories, where individuals occasionally apply the knowledge or rules from one area to a different one. This leads to incorrect reasoning and mistaken explanations or conclusions about events.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that framework theories involve applying knowledge/rules from one domain to another, leading to incorrect reasoning. While they use different terminology ('energy or essence' rather than 'biological contagion'), they capture the core concept that magical contagion results from misapplying domain-specific knowledge across different domains.

Score: 1.0

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

Delusional conspiracies refer to irrational beliefs that are not socially accepted, while non-delusional conspiracies are irrational beliefs that are culturally accepted.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly identifies that delusional conspiracy theories are irrational beliefs that are not socially accepted, but incorrectly states that non-delusional conspiracy theories are also irrational beliefs. According to the answer key, non-delusional conspiracy theories are those that are either rational beliefs OR commonly accepted beliefs, not specifically irrational beliefs that are culturally accepted.

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

Narcissism is associated with a greater tendency to believe in paranormal phenomena and to perceive patterns in random occurrences.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies narcissism as a factor contributing to conspiratorial thinking, which matches one of the listed factors in the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly mentions believing in paranormal phenomena as a factor, which directly corresponds to one of the factors listed in the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies seeing patterns in random occurrences (pattern perception in randomness) as a factor, which matches the answer key's 'seeing patterns in randomness'.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Occasionally, we experience source amnesia, meaning we forget the context in which information was given. As a result, if we cannot recall whether a fact was labeled as true or false, it may disrupt our learning and lead us to mistakenly believe false information is accurate.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies source amnesia as the key mechanism and accurately explains how forgetting the context (that their answer was incorrect) can lead to mistaking the incorrect answer for the correct one, which directly matches the answer key.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

By simply encountering something repeatedly, a person's beliefs are more likely to become aligned with it.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes a general effect of repetition on belief alignment but does not identify the specific psychological mechanism. The answer key requires naming 'mere exposure' (the tendency to prefer familiar things) or the 'illusory-truth effect' as the mechanism politicians use to make messages more attractive through repetition.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

Individuals with MDD often lack the positivity bias that leads others to be overly optimistic. As a result, they tend to make more realistic and accurate predictions about the likelihood of negative events occurring in their lives.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people with MDD are more accurate at predicting negative events due to reduced optimism bias, which aligns with the answer key's point about reduced overly optimistic tendencies leading to greater accuracy.

Score: 1.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

Our belief changes less from our initial belief (it moves less in response to the evidence).

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes how beliefs change in response to evidence, but fails to address the core question about how the influence of prior beliefs on perception changes when sensory reliability decreases. The answer key requires explaining that prior beliefs have greater influence on perception when sensory information is unreliable.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

Pre-conventional: Individuals, often children, develop their sense of right and wrong based on consequences, where good behavior is rewarded and bad behavior is punished. Conventional: People, including children and some adults who don't advance beyond this stage, form their morals according to social expectations and the impact of their actions or rules on others. Post-conventional: Individuals reflect more profoundly on morality, understanding that some ethical principles are universal and instinctive, while also acknowledging that moral values can sometimes conflict with one another.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the pre-conventional level as focusing on consequences, rewards, and punishments, which aligns with the answer key's description of obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as being based on social expectations and considering the impact on others, which matches the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the post-conventional level as involving deeper reflection on morality and universal ethical principles, which corresponds to the answer key's description of focusing on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

The causal model suggests that when we are aware of how past events unfolded, it becomes difficult to identify alternative causal connections based on the information we currently have. People struggle to infer causes when they must ignore the known outcome. Knowing the result beforehand strongly affects the causal links they perceive. This tendency leads to hindsight bias, where individuals believe they could have anticipated the event, even though predicting causal relationships without prior knowledge of the outcome is actually much more challenging.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes effects of causal models but doesn't define what a causal model actually is - they don't explain that it's a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student correctly explains how causal models contribute to hindsight bias by describing how knowing outcomes makes events seem more predictable and inevitable than they actually were.

Score: 0.5

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

When we already know the result of an event, we often believe that the event was easier to predict and bound to happen than it truly was. It's difficult to ignore this knowledge when assessing cause and effect. Thus, the information we acquire plays a key role in hindsight bias, since this bias only arises after we have discovered the event's outcome.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that newly acquired knowledge (learning the outcome) cannot be ignored when making retrospective judgments, which is the core mechanism of how learning contributes to hindsight bias. The explanation demonstrates understanding that the bias occurs because we cannot set aside what we now know when estimating past probabilities.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing decision style involves the desire to select the absolute best option, while satisficing decision style involves settling for a choice that is good enough. The maximizing style is more closely linked to neuroticism compared to the satisficing style.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as selecting the absolute best option, which aligns with the answer key's definition of 'trying to make the best choice'.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as settling for a choice that is good enough, which matches the answer key's definition of 'making a good-enough choice'.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that the maximizing style is more closely linked to neuroticism, which aligns with the answer key stating that high neuroticism individuals are most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style.

Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

One approach is to leverage people's fear of loss by tying participation to their final grade. Additionally, using subtle prompts like passing around a red dice microphone to those eager to speak can make class involvement more enjoyable and appealing. You might also use rewards or consequences to shape participation, such as handing out small candies to those who contribute. For a non-class participation example, to motivate students to complete required reading, you could present the assignment in a way that sparks curiosity, since the way information is framed can affect decision-making.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement by proposing multiple concrete strategies that connect to course concepts: using loss aversion (tying participation to grades), making participation appealing through gamification (red dice microphone), behavioral reinforcement (rewards/consequences with candies), and framing effects to motivate reading. The answer shows thoughtful application of behavioral principles to the practical teaching challenge posed.
