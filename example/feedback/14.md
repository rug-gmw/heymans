Grade: 8.5

## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidtâ€™s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

System 1 operates intuitively, relying on a gut feeling to make a judgment. System 2 involves deliberate reasoning, carefully considering information to reach a logical conclusion. According to this model, System 1 tends to be the more influential of the two.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that System 1 operates intuitively and relies on gut feelings, which aligns with the answer key's requirement that System 1 refers to intuitions/emotion.
- Correct: The student accurately describes System 2 as involving deliberate reasoning and careful consideration to reach logical conclusions, which matches the answer key's description of System 2 as reasoning/rational thought/deliberation.
- Correct: The student states that System 1 is 'more influential of the two,' which correctly identifies System 1 as the dominant system according to Haidt's model.

Score: 1.0

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

Representativeness heuristic refers to judging whether something or someone fits into a particular category by how closely they match the typical characteristics of that category.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process in this scenario.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that the representativeness heuristic involves judging category membership based on how closely someone matches typical characteristics of that category, which directly corresponds to estimating likelihood based on resemblance to stereotypes.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring refers to the phenomenon where the initial information acts as a reference point. Subsequent information may lead to adjustments from this point, but these changes are often insufficient. The primacy effect describes how the first piece of information significantly shapes an overall impression. Both concepts share the idea that the information encountered first exerts a disproportionately strong influence, such as on forming an impression.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies anchoring as using initial information as a reference point, which aligns with the answer key's description of taking the first piece of information as the starting point.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the primacy effect as the first piece of information significantly shaping overall impressions, which corresponds to the answer key's point about better remembering first information.
- Correct: The student clearly identifies that both concepts involve disproportionately strong influence of first-encountered information, which matches the answer key's point about overreliance on first information.

Score: 1.0

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency for individuals to place greater importance on losses than on equivalent gains. Risk aversion describes the preference for sure outcomes rather than uncertain ones. The key distinction is that loss aversion relates to how people value outcomes, while risk aversion concerns their attitude toward the likelihood of those outcomes.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines loss aversion as placing greater importance on losses than on equivalent gains, which matches the answer key's definition of weighing losses more heavily than gains.
- Correct: The student accurately defines risk aversion as the preference for sure outcomes rather than uncertain ones, which aligns with the answer key's definition of preferring certainty over uncertainty.

Score: 1.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias refers to the tendency to overpredict the intensity of future negative emotions. As a result, even when individuals are unhappy in a relationship, they may avoid ending it out of fear that they will experience significant emotional distress afterward.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies impact bias as overpredicting the intensity of future emotions, which aligns with the answer key's definition of overestimating the impact of future events on feelings.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that impact bias prevents breakups because people fear they will experience significant emotional distress, which matches the answer key's point about overestimating how bad a breakup will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting refers to our ability to anticipate how we will feel about future events. This is crucial in end-of-life choices because people often struggle to accurately foresee their emotional responses, including the duration and intensity of those feelings. When healthy, individuals may prefer death over experiencing severe illness or pain, but when faced with the actual situation, their feelings may change because their initial predictions were inaccurate.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines affective forecasting as our ability to anticipate how we will feel about future events, which aligns with the answer key's definition of predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Correct: The student accurately captures the key insight that healthy people may predict preferring death when sick, but their actual preferences may differ when they experience illness, demonstrating understanding of the discrepancy between predicted and actual emotional responses.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

Yes, there is a distinction between simply low probabilities and extremely low probabilities. Extremely low probabilities are often regarded as impossible, leading to their underestimation, while low probabilities tend to be overestimated.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that low probabilities tend to be overestimated, which aligns with the answer key's first point.
- Correct: The student correctly states that extremely low probabilities are often regarded as impossible, which matches the answer key's second point about them being interpreted as impossibilities.

Score: 1.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

People tend to place greater importance on losses than on gains. Losses carry negative value, while gains carry positive value, but the positive value is given less significance.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion means losses are weighed more heavily than gains, and accurately describes that while losses have negative value and gains have positive value, the negative values (losses) are given greater significance than the positive values (gains).

Score: 1.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

In expected utility theory, decisions are influenced by more than just financial outcomes (which is the focus of expected value theory); it also considers the impact of loss aversion.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory focuses on financial outcomes while expected utility theory considers broader factors beyond just financial values.
- Incorrect: The student mentions loss aversion instead of risk aversion. While both are behavioral concepts, the answer key specifically identifies risk aversion as the key difference in how expected utility theory accounts for heuristics and biases.

Score: 0.5

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesnâ€™t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

- Expected value theory is a normative framework focused on guiding financial decision-making.  
- Expected utility theory is also a normative framework but applies to decisions beyond just financial ones.  
- Multi-attribute utility theory is a normative model that considers various attributes, each with its own weight and utility, to inform decision-making.  
- Prospect theory is a descriptive model of choice that incorporates heuristics and biases into the decision process.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected value theory as a normative framework for financial decision-making, which aligns with the answer key's description of it being a normative model for choosing between options with financial outcomes and probabilities.
- Correct: The student accurately describes expected utility theory as a normative framework that applies beyond financial decisions, which matches the answer key's explanation that it's like expected value theory but with subjective utility outcomes rather than just financial ones.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies multi-attribute utility theory as a normative model considering various attributes with weights and utilities, which directly corresponds to the answer key's description of options having multiple attributes, each with utility and weight.
- Correct: The student properly characterizes prospect theory as a descriptive model incorporating heuristics and biases, which matches the answer key's description of it being a descriptive behavioral model similar to expected utility theory but accounting for heuristics and biases.

Score: 1.0

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease peopleâ€™s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency to give greater importance to losses than to equivalent gains. People tend to be more cautious when outcomes are presented as gains, but become more willing to take risks when outcomes are framed as losses.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion leads people to become more willing to take risks when outcomes are framed as losses, which directly addresses how loss aversion can decrease risk aversion. The answer demonstrates understanding that people's risk preferences change based on whether situations are framed as potential gains or losses.

Score: 1.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning refers to learning through the connection of events that occur together. Classical conditioning involves linking stimuli that frequently appear close to each other in time and place. Operant conditioning involves learning to associate behaviors with their consequences, such as rewards or punishments.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies conditioning as learning through connections/associations of events that occur together, which aligns with the answer key's definition of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as linking stimuli that appear close together in time and place, which matches the answer key's explanation of learning to associate things that happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning to associate behaviors with their consequences (rewards or punishments), which directly corresponds to the answer key's definition of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

- Illusory causation refers to the mistaken belief that one event (A) causes another event (B) when no such cause-and-effect relationship exists.  
- Illusory correlation is when people believe that one event (A) occurs after another event (B), even though this sequence is not true, and A doesn't necessarily cause B.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly defines illusory causation as mistakenly believing one event causes another when no causal relationship exists. However, their definition of illusory correlation is incorrect - they describe it as believing events occur in sequence when they don't, rather than perceiving a correlation between variables that don't actually correlate. The key distinction that illusory causation involves misinterpreting an existing correlation as causation, while illusory correlation involves perceiving non-existent correlations, is not captured.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to â€˜properlyâ€™ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

Comprehending the Dutch healthcare system involves a schema, which encompasses all the knowledge you have about a concept (such as a healthcare system). On the other hand, knowing the appropriate way to behave at a birthday party is a script, as a script provides guidance on how to understand a familiar scenario and how to respond within it.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the Dutch healthcare system as a schema and provides an accurate explanation that it encompasses knowledge about a concept, which aligns with the answer key's definition of schemas as knowledge and relationships between things.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies birthday party behavior as a script and provides a good explanation that scripts provide guidance on how to understand and respond in familiar scenarios, which matches the answer key's description of scripts as social schemas for specific situational behavior.

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

Behaviorists embraced the intentional stance, a perspective where individuals consider the reasons behind others' actions (such as wondering why a friend ignored them). Using this approach, behaviorists aim to understand and explain people's behavior and the motivations behind it.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies behaviorists as adopting the intentional stance, when they actually adopted the physical stance. Behaviorists explicitly rejected mentalistic explanations and internal motivations, focusing instead on observable stimulus-response relationships and physical processes. The intentional stance involves attributing beliefs and desires to explain behavior, which is contrary to behaviorist principles.

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

By adopting the intentional stance, they are able to understand people's behavior and the reasons behind it.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the intentional stance instead of the design stance. Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance because they focus on the function and purpose of psychological processes in evolutionary terms, not on beliefs and desires which characterize the intentional stance.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

- consistent: B always comes after A.  
- distinct: B follows A only under certain circumstances.  
- plausible: it is logically reasonable to think that B could occur after A.  
- contiguous in time and space: B happens immediately after A in close proximity.  
- similar cause and effect: for example, moving your leg (A) causes the ball to move (B) when you kick it, so what affects A also affects B.

Feedback:

- Correct: Student correctly identifies consistency as B always following A, matching the answer key's definition.
- Incorrect: Student describes distinctness as 'B follows A only under certain circumstances' which misses the key point that B should follow A but not other events.
- Correct: Student correctly captures plausibility as logical reasonableness that B could occur after A, aligning with the answer key's common sense explanation.
- Correct: Student accurately describes contiguity as B happening immediately after A in close proximity, matching the time and space requirement.
- Incorrect: Student's explanation of similarity focuses on physical interaction rather than superficial resemblance between cause and effect as specified in the answer key.

Score: 0.6

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

- People have a tendency to respond more to negatively framed content, known as the negativity bias. This means that when they encounter moral outrage on social media, they are more inclined to interact with it because of its negative nature.  
- The availability heuristic also influences this behavior. This cognitive shortcut leads us to judge the likelihood of an event based on how readily it comes to mind. Since moral outrage is frequently seen on social media, it is more easily recalled. As a result, we tend to believe it occurs more often than it does in reality.  
- These two factors work together: the negativity bias prompts greater engagement with morally outraged content, making it more memorable, and then the availability heuristic causes people to overestimate its actual prevalence.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias and explains it as the tendency to respond more to negatively framed content, which aligns with the answer key's description of seeking out or placing more weight on negative information like morally outraged content.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the availability heuristic as judging likelihood based on how readily something comes to mind, and correctly connects this to overestimating moral outrage frequency due to its prominence on social media.
- Correct: The student effectively explains how the two biases work together - negativity bias increases attention to moral outrage content, making it more memorable and available, which then leads the availability heuristic to cause overestimation of its prevalence.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

Framework theories are widespread, foundational understandings of how various aspects of the world operate across different areas such as physical, biological, and psychological fields. In the case of magical contagion, an individual transfers knowledge from one domain to another; for instance, they use their biological knowledge to make sense of a physical domain.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student correctly identifies that framework theories involve transferring knowledge between domains, but incorrectly states that biological knowledge is applied to the physical domain. The answer key specifies that contagion concepts from the biological domain are incorrectly applied to the social/psychological/cultural domain, not the physical domain.

Score: 0.0

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

The number of people who believe in it matters. A delusional conspiracy theory is one that only a few believe, while a non-delusional conspiracy theory is accepted by many.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student only identifies the social acceptance criterion (few vs many believers) but completely misses the irrationality criterion. The answer key requires both conditions: irrational belief AND not commonly accepted. The student's answer is incomplete as it ignores whether the belief itself is rational or irrational.

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

- identifying patterns within randomness - identifying as male - having faith in supernatural occurrences

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'identifying patterns within randomness' which matches the answer key point 'seeing patterns in randomness'.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'identifying as male' which corresponds to the answer key point 'being a man'.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies 'having faith in supernatural occurrences' which matches the answer key point 'believing paranormal phenomena'.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you donâ€™t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

Source amnesia refers to the inability to remember where or how one acquired certain information, even though the information itself is retained.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines source amnesia as the inability to remember the source of information while retaining the information itself. This demonstrates understanding of the key mechanism by which incorrect quiz answers can interfere with learning - forgetting that an answer was originally incorrect and potentially mistaking it for correct information.

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

The phenomenon known as the mere exposure effect

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the mere exposure effect, which is the primary psychological mechanism in the answer key. The response demonstrates understanding of the concept that repeated exposure increases preference and attractiveness.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

No. Individuals without major depressive disorder tend to have a positivity bias that leads them to underestimate the chances of negative events occurring. Those with major depressive disorder are less affected by this positivity bias, so it does not reduce the accuracy of their predictions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people with major depressive disorder are more accurate at predictions because they lack the positivity bias (overly optimistic tendency) that affects non-depressed individuals, leading to underestimation of negative events.

Score: 1.0

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

Afterward, prior beliefs have a greater impact and are more heavily incorporated into shaping your perception.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that prior beliefs have a greater impact on perception when sensory information reliability decreases, which matches the key concept that perception becomes increasingly affected by prior beliefs under these conditions.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You donâ€™t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other peopleâ€™s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

- Pre-conventional stage: At this level, individuals focus on the consequences of their actions, such as rewards and punishments.  
- Conventional stage: Here, people consider how their actions are perceived by others and are concerned with othersâ€™ feelings.  
- Post-conventional stage: At this stage, individuals recognize that moral issues can be complex and conflicting, placing more importance on their own beliefs rather than others' opinions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the pre-conventional level as focusing on consequences like rewards and punishments, which aligns with the answer key's description of obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as considering how actions are perceived by others and being concerned with others' feelings, which matches the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the post-conventional level as recognizing moral complexity and placing importance on personal beliefs rather than others' opinions, which aligns with the answer key's description of focusing on abstract principles and values.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

This implies that we tend to recall the actual event more readily than potential alternative outcomes. As a result, the real event is more easily brought to mind and is perceived as something that was likely to occur.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student does not define what a causal model is - they don't mention it being a coherent narrative of how past events are related.
- Correct: The student correctly explains how this contributes to hindsight bias by noting that the actual event becomes more easily recalled and perceived as likely to occur, which aligns with events seeming more inevitable than they were.

Score: 0.5

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

We constantly consider new information, which makes the events we learn about afterward appear more predictable in retrospect.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that new information learned after an event makes that event seem more predictable when looking back, which captures the core mechanism of hindsight bias described in the answer key.

## Question 29
            
Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

Maximizing refers to a desire to select the optimal option, which can be linked to feelings of regret due to uncertainty about whether the decision was correct. Satisficing involves choosing an option that is sufficiently good. Individuals with high levels of neuroticism are more likely to use the maximizing approach when making decisions.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as selecting the optimal option, which aligns with 'trying to make the best choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as choosing an option that is sufficiently good, which matches 'making a good-enough choice' from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that individuals with high neuroticism are more likely to use the maximizing approach, which matches the answer key.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

I would implement a required weekly assignment, but keep it small since students already have a lot on their plates. These assignments would be designed to aid exam preparation. For instance, students could be divided into groups of about five, with each person responsible for studying a specific section of the material and creating questions about it. The rest of the group could use these questions for exam practice. A shared Google Doc might be useful so the teacher can monitor everyoneâ€™s participation. To encourage serious involvement, bonus exam points could be offeredâ€”such as 0.1 points for those who actively contribute. This approach would motivate students to engage with the content and support their studying in the weeks leading up to the exam.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student demonstrates serious engagement by proposing a concrete, well-thought-out solution that addresses the core challenge of promoting active engagement with limited resources. The answer shows understanding of practical constraints (students' workload, teacher's time limitations) and provides specific implementation details (group size, shared documentation, point-based incentives) that reflect genuine consideration of how to make the approach work in practice.
