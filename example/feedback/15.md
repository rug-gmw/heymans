## Question 1
            
According to Jonathan Haidtâ€™s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
Answer key:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

Your answer:

In the social-intuitionist model, System 1 is responsible for guiding moral judgment through instinctive feelings and emotions, demonstrating how reasoning is affected by emotions, heuristics, and biases. System 2, on the other hand, comes into play after the initial gut response, using deliberate reasoning to justify the moral judgment formed by System 1. According to the model, System 1 is the most influential, as it forms the foundation of moral judgment.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies System 1 as involving 'instinctive feelings and emotions,' which aligns with the answer key's requirement for System 1 to refer to intuitions or emotion.
- Correct: The student correctly describes System 2 as involving 'deliberate reasoning to justify the moral judgment,' which matches the answer key's requirement for System 2 to refer to reasoning, rational thought, or deliberation.
- Correct: The student explicitly states that 'System 1 is the most influential' and describes it as forming 'the foundation of moral judgment,' clearly indicating System 1's dominance over System 2.

## Question 2
            
Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
Answer key:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

Your answer:

The representativeness heuristic refers to the tendency to judge that a person is more likely to be part of a specific category if they appear to fit the typical characteristics of that category. In this example, because the student resembles a fashion model, we are more inclined to classify her as a member of that group.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the representativeness heuristic as the underlying cognitive process in this scenario.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that the representativeness heuristic involves judging likelihood of category membership based on how well someone fits typical characteristics or stereotypes of that category, which matches the answer key's explanation.

Score: 1.0

## Question 3
            
What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
Answer key:

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

Your answer:

Anchoring refers to the tendency for an initial piece of information (the anchor) to strongly influence a person's estimate, with subsequent adjustments based on new data often being inadequate. The primacy effect highlights how early information disproportionately impacts people's judgments and decisions. Both concepts share the idea that the first information encountered plays a significant role in shaping individuals' evaluations and choices.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines anchoring as the tendency for initial information to strongly influence estimates, which aligns with the answer key's description of taking the first piece of information as the starting point.
- Incorrect: The student describes primacy effect as early information impacting judgments and decisions, but fails to specifically mention that it relates to better remembering the first piece of information, which is the key memory aspect from the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that both concepts share the commonality of first information playing a significant role in shaping evaluations, which corresponds to overreliance on the first piece of information.

## Question 4
            
What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency to prioritize avoiding losses more than acquiring equivalent gains, while risk aversion involves favoring certainty and steering clear of risk, meaning we choose to avoid uncertainty rather than specifically aiming to prevent losses as in loss aversion.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion involves prioritizing avoiding losses over acquiring equivalent gains, which matches the answer key's definition of weighing losses more heavily than gains or preferring to avoid losses over equivalent gains.
- Correct: The student accurately describes risk aversion as favoring certainty and avoiding uncertainty, which aligns with the answer key's definition of preferring certainty over uncertainty. The student also demonstrates understanding by contrasting it with loss aversion.

Score: 1.0

## Question 5
            
What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
Answer key:

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

Your answer:

Impact bias refers to our tendency to exaggerate the intensity and duration of our emotional reactions to future events. This bias can stop people from ending relationships because they anticipate feeling worse for longer after a breakup than they actually will, often overlooking that they might feel better once the relationship ends compared to how they feel while still together.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines impact bias as the tendency to exaggerate emotional reactions to future events, which aligns with overestimating the impact of future events on our feelings.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that impact bias prevents breakups because people anticipate feeling worse after a breakup than they actually will, which matches the answer key's point about overestimating how bad a breakup will make them feel.

Score: 1.0

## Question 6
            
What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
Answer key:

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

Your answer:

Affective forecasting refers to the process of anticipating the intensity and duration of our future emotions, and people generally struggle with making accurate predictions. This concept is crucial in end-of-life decisions, as such choices involve estimating how we will feel later in life and determining what will be best for us at that stage. When these predictions shift once we reach the end of life, it can lead to difficulties in honoring our original preferences.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies affective forecasting as predictions about future emotional states, though they provide additional detail about intensity and duration which goes beyond but aligns with the core concept.
- Correct: The student captures the essential idea that predictions about end-of-life preferences may change when actually facing those circumstances, demonstrating understanding of why this creates challenges in honoring earlier decisions.

Score: 1.0

## Question 7
            
According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
Answer key:

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

Your answer:

According to the theory, people tend to overestimate low probabilities. However, it varies: for very tiny probabilities, they perceive them as impossible (thus underestimating), while for small probabilities around 10%, they overestimate the likelihood.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that merely low probabilities (like 10%) are overestimated according to prospect theory.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that extremely low probabilities are perceived as impossible, which means they are underestimated or treated as zero probability events.

Score: 1.0

## Question 8
            
When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
Answer key:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

Your answer:

Loss aversion refers to the tendency to prioritize losses more heavily than gains. In prospect theory, this is illustrated by the value function (v), which declines more sharply and over a longer range when objective outcomes decrease, compared to how it rises with gains. The value function indicates that as objective utility grows, subjective utility rises more gradually and grows minimally for larger gains.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that loss aversion means losses are weighed more heavily than gains, and accurately describes that the value function is steeper (declines more sharply) for losses than for gains, which directly matches the answer key.

Score: 1.0

## Question 9
            
What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
Answer key:

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

Your answer:

Expected value theory focuses solely on monetary values, while expected utility theory incorporates utility, a broader subjective measure that individuals assign to outcomes based on their personal preferences and objectives. Additionally, expected value theory overlooks risk factors, whereas expected utility theory explicitly accounts for them.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that expected value theory focuses on monetary values while expected utility theory incorporates utility as a broader subjective measure, which aligns with the distinction between financial and non-financial values in the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly notes that expected value theory overlooks risk factors while expected utility theory accounts for them, which corresponds to the answer key's point about expected utility theory considering risk aversion while expected value theory does not consider heuristics and biases.

Score: 1.0

## Question 10
            
What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
Answer key:

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesnâ€™t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

Your answer:

Expected value theory is a rational framework for decision-making that explains how to maximize value across time. Expected utility theory is a rational approach to decision-making that focuses on maximizing utility over time, aligned with individual preferences and objectives as reflected in utility. Prospect theory is a descriptive model of decision-making that illustrates how we perceive choices in terms of losses and gains, and how we alter the perceived value of outcomes and their likelihoods.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes expected value theory as maximizing value 'across time' rather than choosing between options with probabilistic financial outcomes. The core concept of probability-weighted outcomes is missing.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies expected utility theory as focusing on maximizing utility aligned with individual preferences, which captures the essence of subjective utility beyond just financial outcomes.
- Incorrect: The student completely omitted multi-attribute utility theory, which was one of the four required models in the answer key.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies prospect theory as a descriptive model that deals with how we perceive losses and gains and alter perceived values, capturing its behavioral nature.

Score: 0.5

## Question 11
            
How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
Answer key:

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease peopleâ€™s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

Your answer:

Loss aversion causes individuals to be more cautious about taking risks. Since risks can lead to losses, which loss aversion motivates us to avoid, it influences how risk-averse people are. As a result, we tend to favor certainty and would prefer to secure a small gain rather than face the possibility of losing something.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly states that loss aversion makes people more risk-averse and cautious about taking risks. The answer key indicates the opposite - that loss aversion can actually decrease risk aversion and make people risk-seeking when they face potential losses, as people become willing to accept risk to avoid losses.

Score: 0.0

## Question 12
            
What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
Answer key:

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Your answer:

Conditioning refers to the process of learning to connect two elements based on their joint occurrence. Classical conditioning involves forming an association between two stimuli because they happen near each other in time and place. In contrast, operant conditioning involves learning to link a behavior with a consequence, such as a reward or punishment. The main distinction lies in what is being linked: two stimuli in classical conditioning versus a behavior and its outcome in operant conditioning.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly defines conditioning as learning connections/associations based on joint occurrence, which aligns with the answer key's definition of learning associations through covariation.
- Correct: The student accurately describes classical conditioning as forming associations between two stimuli that happen near each other in time and place, which matches the answer key's explanation of learning to associate things that happen together in time and space.
- Correct: The student correctly explains operant conditioning as learning to link behavior with consequences (rewards or punishments), which directly corresponds to the answer key's definition of learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

Score: 1.0

## Question 13
            
What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
Answer key:

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

Your answer:

Illusory causation refers to the mistaken belief that one event causes another, while illusory correlation involves wrongly thinking that two events frequently happen at the same time. The key distinction is that the first implies a cause-and-effect relationship, whereas the second only suggests a perceived association.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that illusory causation involves mistakenly inferring a causal relationship and illusory correlation involves perceiving an association that doesn't actually exist. The explanation captures the key distinction between incorrectly interpreting causation versus perceiving non-existent correlations.

## Question 14
            
When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to â€˜properlyâ€™ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

Your answer:

The healthcare system is considered a schema because it encompasses general knowledge about what typically happens in such situations, aiding in the interpretation of new information. It is not a fixed sequence of steps but rather a broad framework used to comprehend the scenario. In contrast, a birthday party is a script, as scripts involve detailed knowledge tied to regular events that follow a specific order of actions, such as giving gifts, shaking hands, and then eating cake.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies the healthcare system as a schema and provides accurate reasoning, explaining that it represents general knowledge and a broad framework for understanding rather than a fixed sequence of steps.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies the birthday party as a script and demonstrates understanding by explaining that scripts involve specific sequences of actions in regular events, providing concrete examples like giving gifts, shaking hands, and eating cake.

## Question 15
            
Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

Your answer:

The physical stance focuses on explaining something based on its physical characteristics, specifically how these properties of a stimulus lead to a particular behavior. The mind, however, is understood through the intentional (desires) and design (purpose) stances rather than the physical stance.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: While the student correctly defines the physical stance as focusing on physical characteristics and stimulus-behavior relationships, they incorrectly conclude that the mind should be understood through intentional and design stances rather than the physical stance. This misses the key point that behaviorists specifically rejected studying the mind and instead adopted the physical stance by focusing only on observable stimulus-response relationships.

## Question 16
            
Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennetâ€™s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
Answer key:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

Your answer:

They take the intentional stance because this perspective interprets behavior based on the desires and intentions behind it. For example, ingroup favoritism illustrates how protective communities form through individuals' wishes and intentions to favor members of their own group.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the intentional stance instead of the design stance. While they correctly understand that evolutionary psychology focuses on function, the intentional stance deals with beliefs and desires of agents, whereas the design stance examines the functional design and purpose of systems - which is what evolutionary psychologists actually adopt when analyzing psychological processes in terms of their evolutionary utility.

## Question 17
            
To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
Answer key:

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

Your answer:

Covariation principle: we tend to create a causal explanation when A and B occur together (covariation information). Temporal order: when A happens before B, we are more inclined to believe that A caused B rather than the reverse. Contingency in time and space: we are more likely to conclude that A causes B if they occur close together in both time and location. Similarity of cause and effect: if A matches B in size, duration, or appearance, we are more likely to think A caused B. Distinctiveness or counterfactual reasoning: if we imagine that without A, B would not have happened, then we consider A to be the cause of B.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions 'covariation principle' which is not the same as distinctness/specificity. Distinctness requires that B follows A but not other events, while covariation just refers to A and B occurring together.
- Incorrect: The student describes 'temporal order' (A before B) rather than consistency. Consistency requires that B always follows A, not just the temporal sequence.
- Incorrect: The student does not mention plausibility or common sense as a heuristic for judging causation.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies contiguity in time and space, explaining that A and B occurring close together in time and location supports causal inference.
- Correct: The student correctly identifies similarity of cause and effect, explaining that matching characteristics like size, duration, or appearance support causal inference.

## Question 18
            
We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
Answer key:

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

Your answer:

Negativity bias means we have a tendency to focus on negative information. The availability heuristic is when we estimate how common or likely something is based on how easily we can remember examples of it. In this situation, because we tend to pay more attention to negative content (negativity bias), examples of moral outrage become easy to recall, which then influences our perception of how many people are morally outraged when we observe social media (availability heuristic).

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies negativity bias as the tendency to focus on negative information, which aligns with the answer key's description of seeking out or placing more weight on negative information like morally outraged content.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the availability heuristic as estimating how common or likely something is based on how easily examples can be remembered, which matches the answer key's definition of estimating frequency based on ease of recall.
- Correct: The student successfully explains the connection between the two biases: negativity bias causes attention to negative content, making examples of moral outrage easier to recall, which through availability heuristic leads to overestimating moral outrage frequency.

## Question 19
            
One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
Answer key:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

Your answer:

This mystical contagion phenomenon happens because we apply our understanding from the biological realm (where simply touching someone can spread germs) to the psychological realm, believing that something associated with another person carries negative qualities that could be passed on to us through contact.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that biological domain knowledge about contagion (germs spreading through contact) is being inappropriately applied to the psychological/social domain, where objects are believed to carry negative qualities from disliked individuals.

Score: 1.0

## Question 20
            
What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
Answer key:

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

Your answer:

Delusional conspiracy theories rely on context; for example, atheism might have been considered delusional in medieval times but is not viewed that way today. On the other hand, non-delusional conspiracy theories can be transmitted through cultural narratives across multiple generations, indicating they are not always influenced by context. Additionally, delusional conspiracy theories are typically broadly rejected, while non-delusional conspiracies may contain elements that are partially or entirely accurate.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that delusional conspiracy theories are broadly rejected (not commonly accepted) and demonstrates understanding that the distinction involves social acceptance and contextual factors. While the student doesn't explicitly use the term 'irrational belief,' they effectively capture the key distinction between delusional and non-delusional conspiracy theories through their discussion of social rejection, context-dependency, and accuracy.

## Question 21
            
During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
Answer key:

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

Your answer:

Distrusting science is linked to having less education and embracing populist views, such as skepticism toward the government.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student mentions 'distrusting science' which is not listed among the specific cognitive and personality factors in the answer key.
- Incorrect: The student mentions 'having less education' which relates to low intelligence/analytical thinking from the answer key, but doesn't directly match the specific factors listed.
- Incorrect: The student mentions 'embracing populist views' and 'skepticism toward government' which are not among the cognitive and personality factors specified in the answer key.

## Question 22
            
If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you donâ€™t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
Answer key:

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

Your answer:

This is an example of the availability heuristic, where the wrong answer comes to mind more quickly, leading me to believe it is more probable than the answer I have yet to learn. The ease of recalling the incorrect answer hinders my ability to learn the correct one.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student incorrectly identifies the availability heuristic as the mechanism. The availability heuristic relates to judging probability based on ease of recall, but the question asks about how incorrect answers interfere with learning correct ones. The correct answer involves source amnesia (forgetting the source of information) or proactive interference (old information interfering with new learning), not probability judgments based on recall ease.

Score: 0.0

## Question 23
            
Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
Answer key:

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

Your answer:

They aim to enhance the appeal of their message through a process where repeated exposure leads people to better retain the statements in memory, creating a feeling of familiarity with them, known as availability-by-frequency-of-occurrence.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student describes a memory-based mechanism focusing on retention and availability, but fails to identify the correct psychological mechanism. The answer key requires 'mere exposure effect' (preference for familiar things) or 'illusory-truth effect,' not availability-by-frequency-of-occurrence which is more about memory accessibility than preference or perceived truth.

## Question 24
            
People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
Answer key:

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

Your answer:

No, individuals with major depressive disorder tend to be more precise in their predictions since they are not affected by the tendency to see things more positively.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people with major depressive disorder are more accurate (described as 'precise') at making predictions about negative events, and correctly explains this is due to reduced optimistic bias (described as not being 'affected by the tendency to see things more positively').

## Question 25
            
In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
Answer key:

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

Your answer:

As the accuracy of sensory input diminishes, your existing beliefs have a greater impact on your final perception.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that when sensory input accuracy diminishes (reliability decreases), prior beliefs have greater impact on perception, which directly matches the answer key's core concept.

## Question 26
            
According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You donâ€™t need to describe these stages.)
Answer key:

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other peopleâ€™s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

Your answer:

Pre-conventional: Moral decisions are driven by the desire to gain rewards or avoid punishments. Conventional: Moral reasoning involves considering social norms that maintain society, such as relationships and adherence to laws or authority. Post-conventional: Moral judgments are based on universal principles, where individuals act according to what is inherently right, like a child refraining from causing harm even when no one is watching because it is morally wrong.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes the pre-conventional level as being driven by desire to gain rewards or avoid punishments, which matches the answer key's focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards.
- Correct: The student accurately describes the conventional level as involving consideration of social norms, relationships, and adherence to laws or authority, which aligns with the answer key's focus on social norms and other people's feelings.
- Correct: The student correctly describes the post-conventional level as being based on universal principles and inherent rightness, which matches the answer key's focus on abstract principles and values. The example provided reinforces this understanding.

## Question 27
            
What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

Your answer:

A causal model (rooted in the hypothetical framework) illustrates how we can identify causal factors that provide an explanation for why an outcome happened. These causal elements create a link that clarifies the outcome, making it appear more unavoidable in retrospect due to the meaning-making process we undergo.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that a causal model provides explanations for outcomes and creates links between events, which aligns with the concept of a coherent narrative relating past events.
- Correct: The student accurately explains that causal models make outcomes appear 'more unavoidable in retrospect,' which directly corresponds to the answer key's point about events seeming more inevitable and contributing to hindsight bias.

Score: 1.0

## Question 28
            
How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
Answer key:

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

Your answer:

Learning influences hindsight bias because the curse of knowledge effect causes us to see an outcome as more certain after acquiring information that explains it, making it appear inevitable once we know the result.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly identifies that learning contributes to hindsight bias through the curse of knowledge effect, explaining that newly acquired information makes past outcomes seem more predictable or inevitable than they actually were. This demonstrates understanding of how we cannot avoid incorporating new knowledge when estimating past likelihood judgments.

Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
Answer key:

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

Your answer:

The maximizing decision style involves individuals aiming to make the best possible choice. In contrast, satisficing refers to selecting an option that meets an acceptable level of adequacy. People who have high levels of neuroticism are more likely to use the maximizing decision style.

Feedback:

- Correct: The student correctly describes maximizing as 'aiming to make the best possible choice,' which aligns with the answer key's definition of 'trying to make the best choice.'
- Correct: The student accurately describes satisficing as 'selecting an option that meets an acceptable level of adequacy,' which corresponds to the answer key's 'making a good-enough choice.'
- Correct: The student correctly identifies that people with high neuroticism are more likely to use the maximizing decision style, matching the answer key exactly.

## Question 30
            
Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
Answer key:

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

Your answer:

I would choose the MAUT decision-making approach because it enables me to consider various factors (such as personal interests, adhering to the book, exam preparation, etc.) by assigning importance weights to each and calculating a utility score for each decision based on these factors. This method allows me to prioritize my own goals and preferences while aiming to enhance active involvement with the content.

Feedback:

- Incorrect: The student's answer does not address the actual question about teaching strategies for engaging many students with limited resources. Instead, they discuss using MAUT for personal decision-making without connecting it to the pedagogical challenge posed. The response lacks serious engagement with the core teaching problem presented.
