# Question 1

## Question

According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?

## Answer key

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

## Evaluation

I'm ready to grade the student's answer based on the answer key provided. Each element will receive a pass/fail score and motivation. Please provide the student's answer, and I will respond with a JSON string containing exactly 3 scores and motivations, one for each bullet point from the answer key.

# Question 2

## Question

Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.

## Answer key

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

## Evaluation

I'm ready to grade the student's answer based on the answer key. The response will be in JSON format containing:
1. A pass/fail assessment for identification of the representativeness heuristic
2. A pass/fail assessment for correctly explaining how the representativeness heuristic works

Please provide the student's answer.

# Question 3

## Question

What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?

## Answer key

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

## Evaluation

I'm ready to grade the student's answer about anchoring and the primacy effect once you provide it. I'll evaluate it against the 2-point answer key:
1. Anchoring definition
2. Primacy effect definition and comparison with anchoring

I'll provide my assessment in JSON format with pass/fail scores and motivations for each point.

Please share the student's answer.

# Question 4

## Question

What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?

## Answer key

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

## Evaluation

I'm ready to grade the student's answer based on the answer key provided. The answer key consists of two elements:

1. Definition of loss aversion
2. Definition/distinction of risk aversion

I'll wait for the student's answer and provide a JSON response evaluating each element with pass/fail scores and motivations.

# Question 5

## Question

What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?

## Answer key

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

## Evaluation

I'm ready to grade the student's answer about impact bias based on the answer key provided. I'll assess:
1. Whether they explain impact bias as overestimating the impact of future events on feelings
2. Whether they include the break-up example or a similar valid example

Please share the student's answer and I'll provide a JSON response with pass/fail scores and motivations for each element.

# Question 6

## Question

What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?

## Answer key

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

## Evaluation

I'm ready to grade the student's answer based on the answer key you've provided. The answer key has 2 key points:

1. Definition of affective forecasting as predictions about future emotional states
2. Example about health/sickness preferences changing between prediction and reality

Please provide the student's answer and I will evaluate it according to these criteria using the JSON format requested.

# Question 7

## Question

According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?

## Answer key

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

## Evaluation

I'm ready to evaluate the student's answer based on those 2 points from the answer key, using the JSON format you specified. I'll assess whether their response correctly addresses both:
1. Low probabilities being overestimated
2. Extremely low probabilities being interpreted as impossibilities

Please provide the student's answer and I'll grade it accordingly with pass/fail scores and brief motivations for each point.

# Question 8

## Question

When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?

## Answer key

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

## Evaluation

I'm ready to grade the student's answer based on the answer key once you provide the student response. I will evaluate whether the answer correctly conveys that:

1. Loss aversion means negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities (or that the value function is steeper for losses than gains)

I will provide my evaluation in the requested JSON format, with a pass/fail score and motivation for this element.

# Question 9

## Question

What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?

## Answer key

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

## Evaluation

I'll wait for the student's answer before providing a JSON evaluation based on the answer key points you shared. The evaluation will assess whether the answer correctly addresses:

1. The distinction between expected value (financial only) vs. expected utility (financial + non-financial)
2. How expected utility accounts for risk aversion while expected value doesn't

I'll format the response as a JSON with pass/fail scores and motivations for each point.

# Question 10

## Question

What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.

## Answer key

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

## Evaluation

I'll help grade the student answer against the answer key when you provide it. I will use this format:

{
    "scores": [
        {
            "element": "Expected value theory",
            "pass": true/false,
            "motivation": "Brief explanation"
        },
        {
            "element": "Expected utility theory",
            "pass": true/false,
            "motivation": "Brief explanation"
        },
        {
            "element": "Multi-attribute utility theory",
            "pass": true/false,
            "motivation": "Brief explanation"
        },
        {
            "element": "Prospect theory",
            "pass": true/false,
            "motivation": "Brief explanation"
        }
    ]
}

Please provide the student's answer so I can evaluate it.

# Question 11

## Question

How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?

## Answer key

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

## Evaluation

I'm ready to evaluate the student's answer based on the two key points:
1. People accept risk to avoid loss
2. Loss aversion can decrease risk aversion and lead to risk-seeking behavior

Please provide the student's answer and I will respond with the JSON evaluation.

# Question 12

## Question

What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?

## Answer key

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

## Evaluation

I'm ready to grade the student answer based on the answer key you provided. The response will include:

1. Whether they defined conditioning as learning through covariation
2. Whether they correctly explained classical conditioning
3. Whether they correctly explained operant conditioning

Each element will include a pass/fail score and motivation. Please provide the student's answer.

# Question 13

## Question

What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?

## Answer key

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

## Evaluation

I'm ready to evaluate the student's answer based on your provided answer key. The answer key mentions two distinct phenomena:

1. Illusory causation - incorrectly interpreting correlation as causation
2. Illusory correlation - perceiving a correlation that doesn't exist

I'll wait for the student's answer and provide a JSON response evaluating how well they covered these concepts.

# Question 14

## Question

When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?

## Answer key

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

## Evaluation

I'm ready to grade the student's answer and provide a JSON response according to the answer key, with 2 pass/fail elements and their motivations. Please provide the student's answer.

# Question 15

## Question

Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?

## Answer key

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

## Evaluation

I'm ready to grade the student response based on the answer key about behaviorists and the physical stance. I'll evaluate whether the student's answer correctly addresses:
1. That behaviorists adopted the physical stance
2. Their focus on stimulus-behavior processes/causes

Please provide the student's answer and I'll respond with the requested JSON format evaluating these points.

# Question 16

## Question

Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?

## Answer key

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

## Evaluation

I'm ready to grade the student's answer according to the provided answer key with 2 main elements:

1. Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance
2. They consider psychological processes in terms of their function

Please share the student's answer and I will evaluate it using these criteria, providing pass/fail scores and motivations in the requested JSON format.

# Question 17

## Question

To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.

## Answer key

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

## Evaluation

I'm ready to evaluate the student's answer according to the specified format. Please share the student's answer and I will analyze it against the 5 key points, providing a JSON response with pass/fail grades and motivations for each component.

# Question 18

## Question

We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?

## Answer key

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

## Evaluation

I am ready to evaluate a student answer based on the answer key you provided. The key elements I'll look for are:

1. Definition of negativity bias
2. Definition of availability heuristic
3. Explanation of how these biases interact to affect perception of moral outrage

Please provide the student's answer and I will evaluate it using these criteria in the specified JSON format.

# Question 19

## Question

One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?

## Answer key

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

## Evaluation

I'm ready to grade the student answer and provide scores and motivations in JSON format based on the given answer key. Please provide the student's answer and I'll evaluate it accordingly.

# Question 20

## Question

What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?

## Answer key

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

## Evaluation

I'm ready to assess the student's answer according to the answer key once you provide it. I'll evaluate whether their response captures both key criteria:

1. Irrational belief + not commonly accepted = delusional conspiracy theory
2. Otherwise = non-delusional conspiracy theory

I'll provide my assessment in JSON format with pass/fail scores and motivations for each element. Please share the student's answer when ready.

# Question 21

## Question

During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?

## Answer key

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

## Evaluation

I'm ready to grade the student's answer based on the answer key provided. Please share the student's answer in your next message and I will evaluate it according to the format requested, providing pass/fail scores and motivations for at least three elements from the answer key.

# Question 22

## Question

If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?

## Answer key

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

## Evaluation

I'm ready to grade the student's answer based on the answer key provided. The answer key focuses on source amnesia, proactive interference, or the continued-influence effect as explanations. Please provide the student's answer and I will evaluate it using the specified JSON format, providing pass/fail assessments with motivations for each element.

# Question 23

## Question

Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?

## Answer key

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

## Evaluation

I'm ready to grade a student answer about mere exposure or the illusory-truth effect according to the answer key. I'll provide a JSON response with pass/fail scoring and brief motivations for the score. Please provide the student's answer.

# Question 24

## Question

People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?

## Answer key

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

## Evaluation

I'm ready to evaluate the student's answer according to the answer key provided, judging whether they demonstrate understanding that:

1) People with major depressive disorder are MORE accurate at making predictions
2) This is because they show less optimism bias compared to non-depressed people

I'll assess their answer and provide a JSON response with pass/fail scores and motivations for these two key points.

Please share the student's answer.

# Question 25

## Question

In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?

## Answer key

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

## Evaluation

I'm ready to grade the student's response based on that answer key by evaluating whether they understand that decreased sensory reliability leads to increased influence of prior beliefs/expectations on perception. Please share the student's answer and I will provide a JSON response evaluating it against this single key point.

# Question 26

## Question

According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)

## Answer key

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

## Evaluation

I'm ready to grade the student's answer about the developmental levels, focusing on whether they correctly describe each of the three levels (pre-conventional, conventional, and post-conventional), regardless of whether they name them specifically. I'll evaluate based on the key concepts: punishment/rewards, social norms/others' feelings, and abstract principles/values. Please provide the student's answer.

# Question 27

## Question

What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?

## Answer key

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

## Evaluation

I'm ready to grade the student response based on the answer key. The expected format would include pass/fail evaluations and motivations for two key points:

1. Definition of a causal model
2. Connection to hindsight bias

Please provide the student's answer and I will analyze it according to these criteria.

# Question 28

## Question

How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?

## Answer key

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

## Evaluation

I'm ready to grade the student answer based on the answer key and provide my evaluation in the required JSON format. Please share the student's response.

The answer key suggests I should evaluate:
1. Whether they explain that you cannot avoid taking new information into account when estimating past likelihood judgments
2. While referencing the "curse of knowledge" concept is not required, the explanation should capture this cognitive bias

Please proceed with the student's answer.

# Question 29

## Question

Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?

## Answer key

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

## Evaluation

I understand you want me to:

1. Act as a professor grading a student response
2. Compare it against 3 key points:
   - Defining maximizing
   - Defining satisficing  
   - Connection between neuroticism and maximizing
3. Provide a JSON response with pass/fail and motivation for each point
4. Wait for the student's answer before providing my evaluation

I'll await the student answer to provide my assessment in the requested JSON format.

# Question 30

## Question

Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)

## Answer key

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

## Evaluation

I'll be ready to grade the student's answer based on the criteria you provided, following the format:

{
  "grading": [
    {
      "criterion": "Serious engagement with the question",
      "pass": true/false,
      "motivation": "[brief explanation]"
    }
  ]
}

Please provide the student's answer and I'll evaluate it accordingly.
