# Question 1

## Question

According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?

## Answer key

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

## Evaluation

The question and answer key have some issues that could lead to unfair or ambiguous scoring.

**Problems identified:**

1. **Incomplete explanation of roles**: The answer key only defines what System 1 and System 2 refer to, but doesn't explain their actual *roles* in moral judgment according to Haidt's model. Students might provide more detailed explanations of how these systems function in the moral judgment process.

2. **Missing key theoretical details**: Students familiar with Haidt's model might mention important specifics like:
   - The sequence of moral judgment (intuition first, reasoning second)
   - That reasoning often serves to justify pre-existing intuitions
   - The "emotional dog wagging its rational tail" metaphor

3. **Vague dominance criterion**: "More dominant" could be interpreted and expressed in various ways by students.

**Recommendation:**

Expand the answer key to include:

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 produces immediate moral intuitions/judgments
- System 2 reasoning typically occurs after the initial judgment to justify or rationalize the intuitive response
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking
- Reasoning rarely overrides initial moral intuitions (or equivalent description of System 1 dominance)

This would ensure comprehensive coverage of student responses while maintaining clear scoring criteria.

# Question 2

## Question

Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.

## Answer key

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

## Evaluation

The question and answer key have some issues that could lead to unfair or ambiguous scoring.

**Problems identified:**

1. **Incomplete explanation coverage**: The answer key doesn't account for valid alternative explanations students might provide about what the representativeness heuristic involves (e.g., ignoring base rates, substituting similarity for probability judgments).

2. **Missing scoring guidance**: There's no indication of whether partial credit should be given if students correctly identify the heuristic but provide an incomplete or slightly different explanation.

3. **Potential for valid alternative phrasings**: Students might describe the heuristic using different but equally correct terminology (e.g., "prototype matching," "similarity-based judgment").

**Recommendations:**

Update the answer key to:

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic involves judging probability or likelihood based on similarity to a prototype/stereotype (accept variations in terminology).
- Key concept: We use how much someone resembles our mental representation of a category to estimate their membership in that category.
- Accept additional correct elements such as: ignoring base rates, substituting similarity for statistical reasoning, or using stereotypes as judgment basis.
- Award partial credit if heuristic is correctly identified but explanation is incomplete but accurate.

This would ensure more comprehensive and fair scoring of student responses.

# Question 3

## Question

What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?

## Answer key

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

## Evaluation

The question and answer key have some issues that could lead to ambiguous scoring and may not capture the full scope of accurate student responses.

## Recommendations:

**For the answer key:**

1. **Clarify the anchoring definition** - The current definition is too vague. It should specify that anchoring involves using initial information as a reference point that influences subsequent judgments or decisions, even when that information is irrelevant.

2. **Expand the primacy effect definition** - While correct, this could be more specific about memory recall in sequential information processing.

3. **Refine the commonality statement** - "Overreliance" may be too judgmental. Consider rephrasing to focus on the cognitive mechanism (e.g., "Both demonstrate how initial information disproportionately influences subsequent processing").

4. **Add context specificity** - Include points about:
   - Anchoring typically applies to judgment/decision-making contexts
   - Primacy effect typically applies to memory/learning contexts

**Suggested revised answer key:**
- Anchoring is the cognitive bias where people rely too heavily on the first piece of information (the "anchor") when making decisions or judgments
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember or give more weight to information presented first in a sequence
- Both demonstrate how initial information has disproportionate influence on subsequent cognitive processing
- Anchoring primarily affects judgment and decision-making, while primacy effect primarily affects memory and recall

This revision would allow for more comprehensive and fair scoring of student responses.

# Question 4

## Question

What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?

## Answer key

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

## Evaluation

The question and answer key have some issues that could lead to unfair or ambiguous scoring.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Expand the answer key** to include additional valid formulations that students might use:
   - Loss aversion: "losses are psychologically more impactful than equivalent gains" or "the pain of losing is stronger than the pleasure of gaining"
   - Risk aversion: "preference for guaranteed outcomes over risky ones with the same expected value" or "willingness to accept lower expected returns to avoid uncertainty"

2. **Add a third point** to capture the key conceptual difference:
   - "Loss aversion is about the psychological impact of losses vs. gains, while risk aversion is about attitudes toward uncertainty/variability in outcomes"

3. **Consider adding examples** to the answer key to help graders recognize when students demonstrate understanding through illustrations (e.g., endowment effect for loss aversion, choosing bonds over stocks for risk aversion).

4. **Clarify scoring criteria** - should students get full credit for accurately defining just one concept, or do they need to demonstrate understanding of both plus their relationship?

The current answer key is too narrow and may penalize students who understand the concepts but express them using different (but equally valid) terminology or explanations.

# Question 5

## Question

What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?

## Answer key

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

## Evaluation

The question and answer key need improvement for comprehensive and fair scoring.

**Issues identified:**

1. **Incomplete definition**: The answer key only covers overestimating negative impact, but impact bias includes overestimating both the *intensity* and *duration* of emotional reactions to future events (both positive and negative).

2. **Lacks specificity**: The second point is too brief and doesn't capture the full psychological mechanism of how impact bias specifically prevents breakups.

3. **Missing key components**: Students might provide additional valid explanations about duration bias, focusing illusion, or immune neglect that wouldn't be captured by the current answer key.

**Recommended updates to answer key:**

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the intensity and/or duration of future emotional reactions to upcoming events
- People may overestimate how intensely bad they will feel after a breakup
- People may overestimate how long the negative feelings from a breakup will last
- This leads them to avoid breaking up because they fear the anticipated emotional pain will be worse and longer-lasting than it actually would be
- Accept reasonable explanations about focusing too much on the negative aspects of breaking up while ignoring psychological resilience/adaptation

This expanded answer key would allow for more comprehensive and fair scoring of student responses while capturing the full scope of the psychological concept.

# Question 6

## Question

What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?

## Answer key

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

## Evaluation

The question and answer key need improvement to be comprehensive and allow for fair scoring.

## Recommendations:

**For the answer key, add these essential points:**

- Define affective forecasting more completely (people systematically overestimate the intensity and duration of future emotional states)
- Include the impact bias concept (tendency to overpredict emotional impact)
- Add specific relevance to end-of-life decisions beyond the single example (e.g., predicting quality of life with disability, treatment burden tolerance, family impact)
- Include the implication for advance directives and healthcare decision-making
- Mention adaptation - people often adapt better to difficult circumstances than predicted

**Current issues with the existing answer key:**
- The second bullet point is somewhat unclear and could be interpreted multiple ways
- The example given is overly narrow (only about preferring death when sick)
- Missing key psychological mechanisms that explain why affective forecasting matters in this context

**Suggested revised answer key structure:**
- Definition of affective forecasting and impact bias
- Why it occurs (adaptation, focusing illusion, etc.)
- Specific applications to end-of-life decisions (advance directives, quality of life predictions, treatment preferences)
- Implications for healthcare policy and individual decision-making
- Examples of research findings in this domain

This would allow for more comprehensive and fair scoring of student responses across different levels of detail and understanding.

# Question 7

## Question

According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?

## Answer key

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

## Evaluation

The question and answer key have some issues that could lead to ambiguous scoring.

**Problems identified:**

1. **Incomplete coverage of prospect theory**: The answer key doesn't address the core mechanism - the probability weighting function that explains *why* these biases occur.

2. **Vague terminology**: Terms like "merely low" and "extremely low" aren't precisely defined, and "often" lacks specificity about when these patterns occur.

3. **Missing key distinctions**: The answer key doesn't capture that extremely low probabilities can be both overweighted (when salient) or underweighted/ignored (when abstract).

**Recommendations:**

Update the answer key to:

- People overestimate low probabilities (typically those below ~30-40%) due to the probability weighting function in prospect theory
- Very small probabilities (e.g., 0.01%) are often either greatly overweighted when vivid/salient or treated as zero when abstract
- This creates a discontinuity where tiny probabilities are either ignored completely or given disproportionate weight
- The degree of over/underestimation depends on context, salience, and how the probability is presented

Alternatively, consider revising the question to be more specific about what aspect of prospect theory's treatment of low probabilities you want students to address.

# Question 8

## Question

When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?

## Answer key

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

## Evaluation

The question and answer key need improvement for comprehensive and fair scoring.

**Issues identified:**

1. **Incomplete coverage**: The answer key only captures one aspect of loss aversion in prospect theory. Students may provide other correct formulations that wouldn't be fairly scored.

2. **Ambiguous terminology**: "Weighed more heavily" could be interpreted in multiple ways by students, potentially leading to scoring inconsistencies.

**Recommendation:**

Expand the answer key to include these additional acceptable points:

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities (OR: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains)
- The magnitude of utility loss from losing an amount exceeds the magnitude of utility gain from gaining the same amount
- The value function exhibits greater sensitivity to losses relative to a reference point than to equivalent gains
- Mathematically, |v(-x)| > |v(+x)| for the same absolute value x, where v represents the value function

This expanded answer key would allow for fair scoring of the various ways students might correctly express this concept while maintaining the core understanding that loss aversion reflects asymmetric utility responses to equivalent gains and losses.

# Question 9

## Question

What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?

## Answer key

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

## Evaluation

Looking at this question and answer key, there are some issues that could lead to ambiguous scoring and unfair evaluation of student responses.

**Problems identified:**

1. **Inaccurate first point**: The distinction about "financial vs. non-financial values" is misleading. Both theories can handle monetary outcomes - the key difference is that expected utility theory accounts for diminishing marginal utility and individual preferences through utility functions.

2. **Confusing second point**: The phrasing about "heuristics and biases" is problematic because neither classical theory was designed to incorporate behavioral biases. The real distinction is about risk attitudes and how outcomes are valued.

3. **Missing core differences**: The answer key omits fundamental distinctions that students might correctly identify.

**Recommendation:**

Revise the answer key to:

- Expected value theory assumes linear preferences (treats each additional dollar equally), while expected utility theory uses utility functions that can reflect diminishing marginal utility
- Expected value theory is risk-neutral (only considers mathematical expectation), while expected utility theory can accommodate different risk attitudes (risk aversion, risk seeking, risk neutrality)
- Expected utility theory accounts for individual preferences and subjective value, while expected value theory treats all decision-makers as identical
- Expected value theory multiplies outcomes by probabilities directly, while expected utility theory applies a utility function to outcomes before calculating expected values

This revision would allow for fairer scoring of the various correct ways students might express these fundamental theoretical differences.

# Question 10

## Question

What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.

## Answer key

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

## Evaluation

The question and answer key have some issues that could lead to ambiguous scoring. Here are my recommendations:

**Issues identified:**

1. **Incomplete explanation for Expected Value Theory**: The answer key cuts off mid-sentence ("Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability" - missing what you do with these probabilities)

2. **Unclear distinction between Expected Value and Expected Utility**: The Expected Utility explanation ("outcomes have a utility that doesn't need to be financial, but can also subjective") is imprecise and doesn't clearly explain the key difference

3. **Vague terminology**: "Heuristics and biases" in Prospect Theory is too general without specifying key concepts

**Recommendations:**

Update the answer key to:

- Expected Value Theory: A normative model where you calculate the expected monetary value of each option by multiplying each possible financial outcome by its probability and summing these products
- Expected Utility Theory: A normative model similar to expected value theory, but uses utility values instead of monetary values to account for diminishing marginal utility and risk preferences
- Multi-attribute Utility Theory: A normative model for choosing between options with multiple attributes, where each attribute is assigned a utility value and importance weight, then combined into an overall utility score
- Prospect Theory: A descriptive model that modifies expected utility theory by incorporating psychological factors like loss aversion, reference point dependence, and probability weighting

This would provide clearer scoring criteria and reduce ambiguity in evaluating student responses.

# Question 11

## Question

How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?

## Answer key

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

## Evaluation

The question and answer key have some issues that could lead to ambiguous scoring.

**Problems identified:**

1. **Incomplete coverage**: The answer key only addresses one aspect of how loss aversion affects risk aversion (people becoming risk-seeking to avoid losses), but doesn't cover the equally important concept that people are more risk-averse when facing potential gains.

2. **Missing key terminology**: Students might use important concepts like "reference point," "prospect theory," or "framing effects" that aren't reflected in the current answer key.

3. **Lack of examples**: Students might provide concrete examples (e.g., insurance behavior, investment decisions) that would demonstrate understanding but aren't captured in the current key.

**Recommendations:**

Expand the answer key to include:

- People are more risk-averse in the domain of gains (prefer certain gains over risky gains of equal expected value)
- People become risk-seeking in the domain of losses (prefer risky losses over certain losses of equal expected value)  
- The reference point determines whether outcomes are framed as gains or losses
- Loss aversion creates an asymmetry in risk preferences depending on how choices are framed
- Accept relevant examples that illustrate these concepts (e.g., insurance, gambling, investment behavior)
- Award partial credit for mentioning prospect theory or related behavioral economics concepts

This would ensure comprehensive and fair scoring of all reasonable student responses.

# Question 12

## Question

What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?

## Answer key

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

## Evaluation

The question and answer key need improvement for comprehensive and fair scoring.

## Issues identified:

1. **Incomplete definition of conditioning**: The answer key defines conditioning as "learning associations through covariation," but students may provide other valid definitions (e.g., "a learning process that changes behavior through experience" or "systematic training to produce specific responses").

2. **Oversimplified classical conditioning explanation**: Students may provide more detailed or technical explanations involving unconditioned/conditioned stimuli and responses, which should be credited.

3. **Missing key distinguishing features**: The answer key doesn't clearly highlight the fundamental difference - that classical conditioning involves involuntary/reflexive responses while operant conditioning involves voluntary behaviors.

4. **Lack of scoring flexibility**: The current format doesn't account for partially correct answers or alternative valid explanations.

## Recommendations:

**Update the answer key to include:**
- Alternative valid definitions of conditioning
- Accept explanations of classical conditioning that mention stimulus-response relationships, UCS/CS, UCR/CR
- Accept explanations of operant conditioning that mention behavior modification, reinforcement/punishment schedules
- Add a point about the voluntary vs. involuntary nature distinction
- Include examples as acceptable supporting evidence
- Add partial credit guidelines for incomplete but accurate responses

This will ensure more comprehensive and equitable scoring of diverse student responses.

# Question 13

## Question

What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?

## Answer key

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

## Evaluation

The question and answer key have some issues that could lead to ambiguous scoring and may not capture the full range of acceptable student responses.

## Recommendations:

**For the answer key:**

1. **Break down into separate scorable points** - The current single bullet point combines two complex concepts that should be scored independently:
   - One point for correctly defining illusory causation
   - One point for correctly defining illusory correlation
   - One point for clearly contrasting the two concepts

2. **Clarify the definition of illusory causation** - The current definition is somewhat narrow. Students might correctly explain illusory causation as inferring causation without proper evidence of correlation, or when temporal/coincidental relationships are mistaken for causal ones.

3. **Accept alternative valid explanations** - Students may provide correct examples or describe the cognitive mechanisms behind these phenomena, which should receive credit.

**Suggested revised answer key:**
- Illusory correlation occurs when people perceive a relationship between two variables that are actually unrelated or not correlated
- Illusory causation occurs when people incorrectly infer a causal relationship, either from correlation alone or from coincidental/temporal associations
- Key difference: Illusory correlation involves perceiving non-existent relationships, while illusory causation involves misinterpreting the nature of relationships (assuming causation inappropriately)
- Accept valid examples that demonstrate understanding of either concept

This revision would allow for more comprehensive and fair scoring of diverse student responses.

# Question 14

## Question

When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?

## Answer key

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

## Evaluation

The question and answer key have some issues that could lead to ambiguous scoring.

**Problems identified:**

1. **Terminology confusion in the answer key**: The second point states that birthday party behavior "is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema..." This is confusing since it defines a script as being a type of schema, which muddies the distinction the question is trying to assess.

2. **Incomplete explanation criteria**: The answer key doesn't clearly specify what constitutes an adequate "brief" explanation, making it difficult to score the "why" portion consistently.

3. **Potential for valid alternative explanations**: Students might provide correct but differently worded explanations that don't match the specific language in the answer key.

**Recommendations:**

- **Clarify the second answer key point**: Change it to something like "Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it involves a sequence of expected behaviors and actions for a specific social situation"

- **Add scoring flexibility**: Include a note like "Accept equivalent explanations that correctly identify schemas as knowledge structures/frameworks and scripts as behavioral sequences for specific situations"

- **Consider adding examples**: The answer key could specify that acceptable explanations should mention that schemas organize knowledge/concepts while scripts outline step-by-step behavioral expectations

These changes would make the scoring more consistent and fair while maintaining the question's educational objectives.

# Question 15

## Question

Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?

## Answer key

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

## Evaluation

The question and answer key have a significant issue that needs to be addressed.

**Problem:** The answer key is incorrect. According to Dennett's three stances (physical, design, and intentional), behaviorists actually adopted the **design stance**, not the physical stance.

**Why this is wrong:**
- The **physical stance** involves explaining behavior through underlying physical/biological mechanisms (neurons, brain chemistry, etc.)
- Behaviorists explicitly rejected studying internal mechanisms and focused on observable stimulus-response relationships and learning patterns
- This approach aligns with the **design stance**, which treats the organism as a designed system with predictable input-output relationships without needing to understand internal mechanisms

**Recommendation:**
Update the answer key to:
- Behaviorists adopted the design stance, because they focused on predictable stimulus-response patterns without investigating the underlying physical/biological mechanisms that produce these behaviors.

Alternatively, you could accept both design stance and physical stance answers if students provide adequate justification, as there could be some theoretical debate about this classification. In that case, the answer key should reflect both possibilities with their respective reasoning.

# Question 16

## Question

Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?

## Answer key

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

## Evaluation

The question and answer key are **not comprehensive** and need improvement for fair scoring.

## Issues identified:

1. **Incomplete answer key**: The current answer key only addresses which stance evolutionary psychologists adopt but doesn't address the "why" component that's explicitly asked in the question.

2. **Potential ambiguity**: Students might provide correct reasoning that goes beyond just "because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function."

## Recommendations:

**Update the answer key to include:**

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance
- Because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function/purpose
- Because they assume psychological processes were "designed" by natural selection to serve adaptive functions
- Because they analyze behavior by asking "what is this psychological process for?" rather than focusing on underlying mechanisms or simple patterns

This would allow for more comprehensive and fair scoring of student responses that demonstrate understanding of the design stance concept, even if they express the reasoning in slightly different but correct ways.

# Question 17

## Question

To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.

## Answer key

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

## Evaluation

The question and answer key have some issues that could lead to unfair or ambiguous scoring.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Clarify scoring expectations**: The question asks for "very brief explanations" but doesn't specify whether students need exact terminology or if reasonable paraphrases are acceptable. Consider adding guidance like "exact terms from lecture not required" or specifying that alternative phrasings will be accepted.

2. **Address terminology variations**: The answer key shows parenthetical alternatives (e.g., "Distinctness (or: specificity)"), but only for one heuristic. Students might use different but equivalent terms for other heuristics. Consider:
   - Adding common alternative terms for each heuristic
   - Creating a note that reasonable synonyms will be accepted

3. **Clarify explanation requirements**: The explanations in the answer key vary in specificity. Some students might provide more or fewer details. Consider adding guidance about the minimum level of understanding required (e.g., "must demonstrate basic understanding of the concept").

4. **Consider partial credit**: The current format suggests all-or-nothing scoring for each point. You might want to specify whether partial credit will be given for incomplete but partially correct explanations.

**Suggested addition to answer key:**
Add a note such as: "Accept reasonable paraphrases and alternative terminology. Focus on whether student demonstrates understanding of each concept rather than exact wording."

# Question 18

## Question

We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?

## Answer key

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

## Evaluation

The question and answer key have some issues that could lead to unfair or ambiguous scoring.

**Problems identified:**

1. **The answer key contains three points instead of two** - The question asks for "two biases" but the answer key includes a third explanatory point about how they work together.

2. **Overly specific wording requirements** - The current answer key requires very precise definitions that students might express differently while still demonstrating correct understanding.

3. **Missing alternative correct answers** - Other bias combinations could reasonably explain this phenomenon (e.g., confirmation bias, selection bias, vocal minority bias).

**Recommendations:**

1. **Clarify the scoring structure** - Either:
   - Modify the question to ask for "two biases and explain how they interact"
   - Or restructure the answer key to focus only on identifying the two biases

2. **Make the answer key more flexible** - Rewrite to accept equivalent explanations:
   - Negativity bias: Accept answers describing tendency to focus on/remember negative content more than positive
   - Availability heuristic: Accept answers describing judging frequency based on ease of recall/recent examples

3. **Consider whether other valid bias combinations should be accepted** - Determine if combinations like "selection bias + availability heuristic" or "negativity bias + confirmation bias" would also merit credit.

The current answer key is too rigid and may penalize students who understand the concepts but express them differently.

# Question 19

## Question

One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?

## Answer key

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

## Evaluation

The question and answer key need improvement for fair and comprehensive scoring.

**Issues identified:**

1. **Answer key is too narrow**: The current answer key only captures one possible theoretical explanation (domain confusion/misapplication), but the question asks broadly about "framework theories for different domains of knowledge," which could encompass multiple valid theoretical perspectives.

2. **Lacks specificity**: The answer doesn't specify what constitutes "incorrect application" or provide enough detail for consistent scoring.

3. **Missing alternative valid responses**: Students might correctly reference other relevant frameworks such as:
   - Sympathetic magic principles (similarity and contagion)
   - Cognitive categorization theories
   - Social psychology frameworks about object associations
   - Anthropological theories about symbolic contamination

**Recommendation:**

Expand the answer key to include multiple acceptable theoretical explanations, such as:

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is applied to the social/psychological domain (where physical contamination rules don't actually apply)
- References sympathetic magic or laws of contagion (things that were once in contact maintain a connection)
- Explains through cognitive frameworks about category boundaries and contamination
- Discusses social psychology theories about object-person associations and symbolic meaning
- Award partial credit for identifying domain transfer/misapplication even if less precisely articulated

This would allow for fairer scoring of the diverse valid responses students might provide.

# Question 20

## Question

What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?

## Answer key

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

## Evaluation

The question and answer key have significant issues that would make fair and unambiguous scoring difficult.

**Problems identified:**

1. **Incomplete answer key**: The single point doesn't adequately capture the complexity of distinguishing delusional from non-delusional conspiracy theories. Students may provide valid alternative frameworks (e.g., evidence-based criteria, clinical psychology definitions, epistemological distinctions).

2. **Ambiguous terminology**: Terms like "irrational belief" and "commonly accepted" are subjective and poorly defined, making consistent scoring nearly impossible.

3. **Oversimplified criterion**: The answer reduces a complex psychological/philosophical distinction to just two vague criteria, potentially missing other valid distinguishing factors.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Expand the answer key** to include multiple acceptable approaches:
   - Evidence-based distinctions (availability and quality of supporting evidence)
   - Clinical criteria (impact on functioning, resistance to contradictory evidence)
   - Social/cultural factors (group consensus, mainstream acceptance)
   - Logical coherence and falsifiability

2. **Define key terms** or provide examples of what constitutes "irrational" vs. "rational" beliefs

3. **Consider revising the question** to be more specific, such as: "According to clinical psychology, what criteria distinguish pathological conspiracy beliefs from non-pathological ones?" or "What evidence-based factors help differentiate between reasonable and unreasonable conspiracy theories?"

The current answer key is too narrow and ambiguous for fair assessment of student responses.

# Question 21

## Question

During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?

## Answer key

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

## Evaluation

The question and answer key have some issues that could lead to unfair or ambiguous scoring.

**Problems identified:**

1. **Single scoring rubric**: The answer key treats all factors as one combined point worth 3 points, making it difficult to award partial credit fairly. A student who provides 2 correct factors would presumably receive 0 points rather than partial credit.

2. **Vague phrasing**: Some factors in the key use imprecise language (e.g., "attributing agency where it does not exist" could be interpreted various ways by students).

3. **Potentially problematic inclusion**: "being a man" as a factor may be scientifically questionable and could be seen as inappropriate for an academic assessment.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Restructure the scoring**: Break into separate 1-point items:
   - Factor 1 correctly identified (1 point)
   - Factor 2 correctly identified (1 point) 
   - Factor 3 correctly identified (1 point)

2. **Clarify acceptable phrasings**: For each factor, provide the exact terminology used in lecture plus acceptable alternative phrasings students might use.

3. **Review factor list**: Ensure all listed factors were actually covered in lecture and are academically appropriate. Consider removing or rewording problematic items.

4. **Add specificity**: Specify whether students need to explain the factors or just name them.

This would create a more equitable scoring system with clearer expectations.

# Question 22

## Question

If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?

## Answer key

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

## Evaluation

The question and answer key have some issues that could lead to unfair or ambiguous scoring.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Separate the answer key points**: The current format bundles multiple distinct psychological mechanisms into one scoring point. This should be split into separate, scoreable items:
   - Source amnesia (forgetting the source/context of information)
   - Proactive interference (old information interfering with new)
   - Continued-influence effect (persistence of incorrect information)

2. **Clarify scoring criteria**: The parenthetical "alternative answers" creates ambiguity about whether students need to mention source amnesia specifically or if any of the three mechanisms would receive full credit.

3. **Consider adding other valid mechanisms**: The answer key may be incomplete. Other relevant psychological mechanisms could include:
   - Interference theory more broadly
   - False memory formation
   - Retrieval-induced forgetting

4. **Improve answer key structure**: Format as separate bullet points with clear indication of whether each represents a complete answer or partial credit, for example:
   - Source amnesia: forgetting that your initial answer was incorrect
   - Proactive interference: initial incorrect responses interfering with learning correct information
   - Continued-influence effect: persistence of misinformation despite correction

This would allow for more precise and fair scoring of student responses.

# Question 23

## Question

Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?

## Answer key

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

## Evaluation

The question and answer key need improvement for comprehensive and fair scoring.

**Issues identified:**

1. **Incomplete answer key**: The key mentions "Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect" but doesn't provide it as a separate scorable point, creating ambiguity about whether students need both concepts or just one.

2. **Missing key mechanism**: The illusory-truth effect is actually more directly relevant to the question than mere exposure, as it specifically relates to repeated statements being perceived as more truthful/credible.

3. **Lack of scoring clarity**: It's unclear whether students receive full credit for either answer or need both for maximum points.

**Recommendation:**

Update the answer key to:

- Mere exposure effect: the tendency to prefer things that are familiar to us
- Illusory-truth effect: the tendency to believe repeated statements are more likely to be true
- Accept either mechanism for full credit, as both are psychologically valid explanations for why politicians use repetition

Alternatively, clarify in the question whether you want one specific mechanism or are open to multiple valid psychological explanations.

# Question 24

## Question

People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?

## Answer key

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

## Evaluation

The question and answer key have some issues that could lead to unfair or ambiguous scoring.

**Problems identified:**

1. **Oversimplified answer**: The single answer point presents only one perspective (depressive realism) without acknowledging the complexity and ongoing debate in the research literature.

2. **Missing nuance**: The answer doesn't account for legitimate alternative responses students might provide based on different research findings or theoretical frameworks.

3. **Potential for multiple valid answers**: Students might correctly argue that depression can make predictions *less* accurate due to cognitive biases like catastrophizing or hopelessness.

**Recommendation:**

Revise the answer key to include multiple acceptable response categories:

- **Acceptable "No" responses**: Depression may increase accuracy due to reduced optimism bias/depressive realism
- **Acceptable "Yes" responses**: Depression may decrease accuracy due to catastrophizing, hopelessness, or overly negative predictions
- **Acceptable nuanced responses**: The relationship is complex and depends on the type of prediction, severity of depression, or specific circumstances
- **Required elements**: Response should demonstrate understanding that depression affects prediction accuracy (regardless of direction argued)
- **Credit for**: Citing relevant research, acknowledging complexity, or discussing specific cognitive mechanisms

This approach would allow you to fairly evaluate students who demonstrate knowledge of the topic while taking different defensible positions based on the literature.

# Question 25

## Question

In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?

## Answer key

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

## Evaluation

The question and answer key have some issues that could lead to ambiguous scoring. Here are my recommendations:

**Problems identified:**
1. The answer key contains only one scoring point, but students could provide multiple valid ways to express this concept
2. The parenthetical alternative phrasing suggests there are multiple acceptable ways to answer, but this isn't clearly structured for scoring
3. Students might provide correct answers using different terminology (e.g., "prior knowledge" vs "prior beliefs," "sensory input" vs "sensory information")

**Recommendations:**

**Update the answer key to include multiple scoring points:**
- When sensory information is less reliable/unreliable, prior beliefs have greater influence on perception
- The weighting shifts toward prior expectations when sensory evidence is weak/noisy/uncertain
- Perception becomes more dependent on what is expected rather than what is sensed
- The brain relies more heavily on top-down processing when bottom-up information is degraded

**Alternatively, clarify the scoring rubric:**
- Specify that equivalent terminology should be accepted (e.g., "prior knowledge/beliefs/expectations," "sensory evidence/information/input")
- Indicate whether partial credit will be given for responses that capture the general concept but lack precision

This would make scoring more comprehensive and fair while reducing ambiguity about what constitutes a correct response.

# Question 26

## Question

According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)

## Answer key

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

## Evaluation

The question and answer key are **not comprehensive** and need improvement for fair scoring.

## Recommendations:

**For the Answer Key:**

1. **Add acceptable alternative terminology**: Students may use slightly different but correct terms (e.g., "Preconventional" vs "Pre-conventional," "Postconventional" vs "Post-conventional").

2. **Expand acceptable descriptions** with more specific criteria. For example:
   - Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain personal rewards/benefits; self-interest oriented; external consequences determine right/wrong
   - Conventional Level: Focus on social approval, maintaining relationships, following social norms/laws, being a "good" member of society
   - Post-conventional Level: Focus on universal ethical principles, abstract moral reasoning, principles that transcend specific laws or social agreements

3. **Clarify partial credit policy**: Specify how to handle responses where students correctly name levels but provide weak descriptions, or vice versa.

4. **Add scoring guidance** for edge cases, such as:
   - What if a student provides excellent descriptions but in the wrong order?
   - How much detail is required in the "very brief" descriptions?
   - Are examples acceptable in place of or in addition to descriptions?

The current answer key is too narrow and may unfairly penalize students who demonstrate understanding using slightly different but equally valid language.

# Question 27

## Question

What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?

## Answer key

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

## Evaluation

The question and answer key need improvement to enable comprehensive and fair scoring.

## Recommendations:

**For the answer key:**
- Add a point about causal models being constructed retroactively/after outcomes are known
- Include that causal models involve selection and emphasis of certain factors while downplaying others
- Specify that hindsight bias occurs because the causal model makes the actual outcome appear more predictable/foreseeable than it was at the time
- Add that alternative outcomes seem less plausible once a causal model is constructed
- Consider including that causal models help people make sense of complex events by imposing structure

**For scoring clarity:**
- Specify whether students need to address both parts of the question (definition AND contribution to hindsight bias) to receive full credit
- Consider adding point values or weighting for each component
- The current second point contains a grammatical error ("seems" should be "seem") that should be corrected

The current answer key is too brief and may not capture the range of sophisticated responses students might provide about this psychological concept.

# Question 28

## Question

How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?

## Answer key

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

## Evaluation

The question and answer key have some issues that could lead to unfair or ambiguous scoring.

**Problems identified:**

1. **Incomplete coverage**: The answer key only addresses one mechanism (curse of knowledge/inability to ignore new information) but doesn't cover other well-established ways learning contributes to hindsight bias, such as:
   - Memory reconstruction processes where new knowledge alters how we remember our previous beliefs
   - Sense-making processes where learning creates coherent narratives that make outcomes seem inevitable
   - Availability bias where learned information makes supporting evidence more accessible

2. **Vague scoring criteria**: The single point is quite broad and doesn't specify what level of detail or accuracy is required for full credit.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Expand the answer key** to include multiple mechanisms:
   - Curse of knowledge/contamination effect
   - Memory reconstruction/updating
   - Narrative coherence/sense-making
   - Increased availability of supporting information

2. **Add scoring guidance** such as:
   - Specify how many mechanisms students need to identify for full credit
   - Indicate whether examples are required
   - Clarify the level of detail expected for each point

3. **Consider refining the question** to be more specific about scope (e.g., "Describe two ways that learning contributes to hindsight bias") to help guide both student responses and scoring consistency.

# Question 29

## Question

Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?

## Answer key

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

## Evaluation

The question and answer key have some issues that could lead to ambiguous scoring and missed important content.

## Recommendations:

**For the answer key:**

1. **Expand the decision style descriptions** to include key distinguishing features:
   - Maximizing: seeking to make the optimal/best possible choice by extensively searching and comparing all available alternatives
   - Satisficing: choosing the first option that meets acceptable criteria or minimum standards ("good enough")

2. **Add explanation for the personality-decision style link:**
   - High neuroticism individuals tend toward maximizing because they experience more anxiety and worry about making wrong decisions, leading them to over-analyze options

3. **Consider adding common alternative acceptable answers:**
   - Students might mention that maximizers experience more regret, decision difficulty, or analysis paralysis
   - Students might describe satisficing as more efficient or less mentally taxing

**Current issues:**
- The descriptions "best choice" vs "good-enough choice" are too brief and don't capture the behavioral differences
- No explanation is provided for WHY neurotic individuals prefer maximizing
- The connection between neuroticism and decision style might not be clear to students without the underlying reasoning

These additions would make the scoring more comprehensive and fair while reducing ambiguity about what constitutes a complete answer.

# Question 30

## Question

Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)

## Answer key

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

## Evaluation

The question and answer key are **not comprehensive** and would create significant scoring challenges.

## Issues:

1. **Subjective scoring criteria**: "Serious engagement" is too vague and subjective, leading to inconsistent grading between different evaluators or even the same evaluator at different times.

2. **Lack of specific content expectations**: The answer key doesn't identify any key concepts, strategies, or course materials that students should demonstrate knowledge of.

3. **No clear rubric**: There are no specific criteria to distinguish between different levels of engagement or to guide what constitutes "serious" versus superficial responses.

## Recommendations:

**Update the answer key to include specific, measurable criteria such as:**

- Mentions at least 2 specific teaching strategies for large classes (e.g., peer instruction, flipped classroom, active learning techniques)
- Acknowledges the constraint of limited time/resources for grading
- Proposes scalable assessment methods (e.g., peer assessment, multiple choice with application, auto-graded online activities)
- Demonstrates understanding of student engagement principles from course materials
- Provides practical implementation details
- Shows awareness of potential challenges and solutions

**Alternative approach:** Convert this to a more structured question with specific sub-parts that can be scored objectively, or provide a detailed rubric with point allocations for different levels of response quality.

This would ensure fair, consistent, and transparent grading while maintaining the question's intent to assess practical application of course concepts.
