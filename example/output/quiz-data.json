Expected utility theory is also normative; it requires assigning a utility to each option, determining their importance, performing a calculation, and choosing the option with the greatest utility. Multi-attribute utility theory, another normative approach, involves identifying all attributes and alternatives, assigning importance to each attribute, scoring them based on utility, summing the scores for each alternative, and selecting the best one. Prospect theory, which is descriptive and developed by Kahneman and Tversky, is based on three main assumptions: people evaluate outcomes in terms of gains and losses rather than absolute values; they often misjudge utility, tending to overestimate medium to high utilities while displaying loss aversion; and they generally misinterpret probabilities, overestimating low probabilities and treating extremely low or high probabilities as impossible or certain.",

Operant conditioning is illustrated by the famous bell and dog experiment: when food is given to the dog while a bell rings, the dog eventually connects the bell with the food and begins to salivate at the sound of the bell alone, even without food present. Classical conditioning involves having a stimulus and a response, but if we connect that stimulus to a different response, our learning adapts to include this new reaction. For example, pain triggers fear, fire causes pain, so fire becomes something that elicits fear.",

Plausibility indicates that it's reasonable to believe event A causes event B; many people I know also get stomach aches after eating a lot of candy, and scientific studies support this. Contiguity in time and space means event B occurs shortly after and near the time of event A; if I ate candy two days ago and have a stomach ache now, it's unlikely the candy caused it.

This approach ensures that students first engage with the content to formulate a question, and then, if they do not know the answer to the question they receive, they need to interact with the material further to provide a response.

There are various types of nudges, and employing multiple ones may improve effectiveness. For instance, we could make learning resources easier to access, increase the visibility of individual performance to create social motivation, and establish high standards that serve as anchors, encouraging people to meet or exceed them rather than settling for lower expectations.",

I want active participation, but since I don\u2019t have the capacity to personally provide feedback or answer every question, I\u2019d need to implement systems that encourage engagement while fitting my limited availability. I\u2019d likely incorporate peer feedback, where students review each other's work, helping them deepen their understanding and gain diverse insights. It\u2019s also crucial to ensure students actually participate by asking questions, providing feedback, and completing assignments. Motivation should involve both rewards and potential losses, as benefits alone often aren\u2019t enough; for example, using grades, pass/fail statuses, extra credit, or additional exam attempts. I might include an optional \u201copinion question\u201d that factors into grading or pass/fail, prompting students to formulate and support their views, which encourages engagement through critical thinking. If time permits, organized debates could be an enjoyable addition to classes or assignments. Having used many of these methods myself, I believe the key is choosing strategies you genuinely care about and have thoughtfully prepared. Virtually any tool or incentive can work if it effectively motivates students; understanding their motivations and life circumstances is essential for making decisions. Exams could then involve multiple choice, short answers, or AI grading, since much of the learning would already be demonstrated during class and assignments. Personally, I appreciated how last year\u2019s 'Onderzoeksmethoden Theorie & Ethiek' course graded students based on effort, time, and involvement through tiered, stackable assignments.

Heymans was a valuable addition to supporting student engagement, though it needs improvement.
