# Question 2

## Question

We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?

## Answer key

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

## Evaluation

After reviewing the question, answer key, and incorrect student responses, I believe the answer key is fine and appropriately captures the core concepts being tested. Here's my analysis:

1. The answer key clearly identifies the two specific biases (negativity bias and availability heuristic) that work together to create this effect.

2. The incorrect student responses demonstrate clear misunderstandings by:
   - Substituting other biases (false consensus effect, confirmation bias) for the negativity bias
   - Missing the crucial interaction between the two correct biases

3. The answer key properly emphasizes not just the identification of the two biases but also their interaction (how the negativity bias feeds into the availability heuristic), which is crucial for full understanding of the phenomenon.

The student responses that received partial credit did so appropriately for correctly identifying the availability heuristic while missing the other key components of the complete answer.

While the alternative biases mentioned by students (false consensus effect, confirmation bias) might play some role in social media perception, the question specifically asks for the two biases that "primarily contribute" to this effect, and the answer key correctly identifies these.

No modifications to the answer key are needed.

# Question 3

## Question

During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?

## Answer key

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.
