# Question 1

## Question

According to Jonathan Haidt’s social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?

## Answer key

- System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
- System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
- System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).

## Evaluation

After reviewing the student responses against the answer key, I believe **some student responses were unfairly considered incorrect** due to overly rigid interpretation of the answer key.

## Issues with the Current Scoring:

Several students demonstrated clear understanding of Haidt's model but were marked incorrect because they didn't use the exact terminology specified in the answer key. For example:

- Students who described System 1 as "automatic and intuitive" or involving "gut feelings" were marked incorrect for not explicitly using the word "intuitions"
- Students who described System 2 as "deliberate," "careful and intentional thinking," or "thoughtful consideration" were marked incorrect for not using "reasoning" or "rational thought"

## Recommendation:

The answer key should be updated to accept **conceptually equivalent descriptions** rather than requiring exact terminology. Here's my suggested revision:

**Updated Answer Key:**
- System 1 thinking refers to intuitions/emotions **OR equivalent descriptions such as: automatic responses, gut feelings, immediate reactions, instinctive judgments**
- System 2 thinking refers to reasoning/rational thought/deliberation **OR equivalent descriptions such as: careful thinking, thoughtful consideration, deliberate analysis, conscious reflection**
- System 1 is more dominant than System 2 **OR equivalent statements indicating System 1's primacy**

## Specific Cases for Reconsideration:

Students in responses #1, #2, #3, #4, #7, #9, and #10 demonstrated clear understanding of the core concepts and should receive higher scores. They accurately described the functional characteristics of each system and correctly identified System 1's dominance, which shows they grasped Haidt's social-intuitionist model.

The current answer key penalizes students for not using specific vocabulary while rewarding rote memorization over conceptual understanding.

# Question 2

## Question

Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.

## Answer key

- The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
- The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).

## Evaluation

Looking at these student responses, I can see several instances where students were unfairly penalized despite demonstrating correct understanding of the underlying concept.

## Issues with the Answer Key

The answer key is **too rigid in its terminology requirements**. Several students received lower scores solely for using alternative but correct terminology for the same psychological concept:

1. **"Representativeness bias" vs "Representativeness heuristic"** - Multiple students used "bias" instead of "heuristic" but showed perfect understanding of the concept
2. **"Prototype heuristic"** - One student used this term while providing a textbook-perfect explanation of the mechanism
3. **"Representation bias"** - Another variant that captured the essence correctly

## Specific Examples of Unfair Scoring

- Student who wrote: *"Representation bias occurs when we assume that A is B simply because A resembles B"* - This is an excellent, concise explanation but was marked wrong only for terminology
- Student who wrote: *"The prototype heuristic leads us to identify a person or thing as a certain category if they closely match the typical example of that category"* - Perfect conceptual understanding, wrong only on naming

## Students Who Did Deserve Low Scores

Students who incorrectly identified completely different heuristics (availability heuristic, simulation heuristic) or provided fundamentally wrong explanations were appropriately scored.

## Recommendation

**Update the answer key to accept alternative terminology** when the explanation demonstrates correct understanding. The key should accept:
- "Representativeness heuristic" OR "Representativeness bias" 
- "Prototype heuristic" (when properly explained)
- Other reasonable variants

**Focus scoring on conceptual understanding** rather than exact terminology matching. The core concept (judging category membership based on similarity to stereotypes/prototypes) should be the primary criterion, with terminology being secondary.

This would make the scoring more fair while still maintaining academic rigor.

# Question 3

## Question

What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?

## Answer key

- Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
- The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
- Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information

## Evaluation

After reviewing the student responses and comparing them to the answer key, I believe **some student responses were unfairly penalized** due to issues with the answer key.

## Main Issues with the Answer Key:

1. **Overly narrow definition of primacy effect**: The answer key defines primacy effect solely as a memory phenomenon ("tendency to better remember the first piece of information"). However, many students correctly described it as the tendency for first information to have disproportionate influence on judgments and impressions - which is a legitimate and widely accepted definition of the primacy effect in psychology.

2. **Inconsistent application of "starting point" terminology**: Several students accurately captured the essence of anchoring (using initial information as a reference point, baseline, etc.) but were marked incorrect for not using the exact phrase "starting point."

## Recommended Updates to Answer Key:

**Anchoring**: Accept responses that describe anchoring as:
- Using the first/initial piece of information as a starting point, reference point, or baseline for judgments/decisions
- The tendency to rely heavily on the first information encountered when making decisions

**Primacy Effect**: Accept responses that describe it as either:
- The tendency to better remember information presented first, OR
- The tendency for first information to have disproportionate influence on judgments and overall impressions

**Commonality**: Accept responses indicating that both involve:
- Overreliance on first/initial information
- Disproportionate influence of early information
- Difficulty in adjusting from initial impressions

Several students (particularly those in responses 1, 6, 10, 13, and 14) demonstrated solid understanding of these concepts but were penalized for using slightly different but accurate terminology or focusing on the judgment/impression aspects of primacy effect rather than just memory.

# Question 4

## Question

What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?

## Answer key

- Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
- Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.

## Evaluation

Looking at the student responses and feedback, I notice several instances where students were unfairly marked incorrect due to issues with the answer key's precision and application.

## Issues with the Answer Key:

1. **Risk Aversion Definition Too Narrow**: The answer key defines risk aversion as "tendency to prefer certainty over uncertainty," but the feedback consistently rejects correct alternative phrasings like "avoiding risks," "preferring safe choices," or "steering clear of risky situations." These are all valid expressions of the same concept.

2. **Loss Aversion Feedback Inconsistency**: Some students correctly captured the essence of loss aversion (that losses are weighted more heavily than gains) using different wording, but were marked incorrect due to overly strict interpretation.

## Specific Examples of Unfair Marking:

- Student describing risk aversion as "preference to steer clear of risky situations" was marked wrong, but this accurately reflects preferring certainty over uncertainty
- Student saying "preferring to avoid uncertain situations" was marked correct, while "avoiding risks" was marked incorrect - these are essentially equivalent
- Several students correctly identified the asymmetric weighting of losses vs. gains but were penalized for not using the exact phrasing from the answer key

## Recommendation:

The answer key should be updated to accept reasonable alternative phrasings that capture the core concepts:

**Loss Aversion**: Accept responses that indicate losses are weighted more heavily than gains, including phrases like "losses feel more significant than equivalent gains," "preferring to avoid losses over acquiring gains," or "losses have greater impact than equivalent gains."

**Risk Aversion**: Accept responses that indicate preference for certainty over uncertainty, including phrases like "avoiding risks," "preferring safe/certain options," "steering clear of risky situations," or "preferring guaranteed outcomes over uncertain ones."

The current answer key is too restrictive and penalizes students for using synonymous but equally correct terminology.

# Question 5

## Question

What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?

## Answer key

- Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
- Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.

## Evaluation

After carefully reviewing the student responses against the answer key, I believe the answer key is **too restrictive** and some students were unfairly penalized.

## Issues with the current answer key:

**1. Overly narrow definition of impact bias:**
Several students correctly captured the core concept of impact bias but used slightly different wording and were marked incorrect. For example:

- Student 2: "tendency to exaggerate the emotional intensity of a decision" 
- Student 6: "tendency of individuals to exaggerate the intensity of their negative emotions following a particular choice"
- Student 9: "tendency to overestimate the extent of the consequences an action will have"
- Student 12: "overestimate or misjudge the true effect their choices will have"

These definitions all capture the essential concept of overestimating impact, but were marked wrong for being "too narrow" or missing specific phrasing.

**2. Inconsistent scoring of the application part:**
Students 7 and 9 were given partial credit for correctly explaining how impact bias prevents breakups despite not defining the term correctly, while Student 12 was marked wrong for suggesting people "undervalue how much ending the relationship would improve happiness" - which is actually the flip side of overestimating how bad the breakup will feel.

## Recommendation:

**Update the answer key to accept broader but accurate definitions:**

- **Impact bias definition:** Accept answers that correctly identify the core concept of overestimating the emotional impact, intensity, or consequences of future events, even if they don't use the exact phrase "impact of future events on our future feelings."

- **Application part:** Accept explanations that correctly identify either:
  - Overestimating how bad/painful the breakup will feel, OR
  - Underestimating how much better they would feel after breaking up
  
  Both capture the same underlying bias mechanism.

With these changes, Students 2, 6, 9, and 12 should receive higher scores for demonstrating understanding of the concept despite minor variations in wording.

# Question 6

## Question

What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?

## Answer key

- Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
- Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.

## Evaluation

Looking at the student responses and the feedback provided, I can see several instances where students were unfairly penalized due to limitations in the answer key.

## Issues with the Answer Key

The main problem is that the answer key's definition of affective forecasting is **too narrow and imprecise**. The key defines it as "predictions about our own future emotional state," but many students provided more complete and accurate definitions that were marked incorrect.

## Unfairly Marked Responses

Several students correctly defined affective forecasting in ways that are actually more precise than the answer key:

- **Students who described it as "predicting how future events will influence our emotions"** were marked wrong, but this is actually a more complete definition than just "predictions about future emotional state."

- **One student was penalized** for defining it as "predicting how future actions will influence our emotions," when this is essentially correct - affective forecasting does involve predicting emotional consequences of actions/events.

- **Another student** correctly explained the concept as "allowing your choices to be shaped by how you expect to feel in the future" but was marked as only partially correct on the definition.

## Recommendations for Updating the Answer Key

1. **Expand the definition** to be more inclusive and accurate:
   - "Affective forecasting refers to our attempts to predict how we will feel emotionally in response to future events, situations, or circumstances."

2. **Accept equivalent formulations** such as:
   - "Predicting how future events will affect our emotions"
   - "Anticipating our emotional reactions to future situations"
   - "Forecasting how we will feel about future experiences"

3. **Clarify the scoring rubric** to recognize that students may phrase the core concept in different but equally valid ways.

The current answer key is too restrictive and penalizes students for providing more nuanced or complete definitions of a well-established psychological concept. The second part of the answer key (about the healthy vs. sick preference discrepancy) appears to be scored more fairly.

# Question 7

## Question

According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?

## Answer key

- Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
- Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.

## Evaluation

Looking at the student responses and feedback provided, I need to evaluate whether the answer key is accurate according to prospect theory.

The answer key states:
1. Merely low probabilities are often overestimated
2. Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities

After reviewing all the incorrect student responses and their feedback, I can see a consistent pattern in the grading that aligns with established findings in prospect theory research. The feedback correctly identifies when students:

- Incorrectly state that low probabilities (like 10%) are underestimated, when they should be overestimated
- Correctly identify that extremely low probabilities (like 0.01%) are treated as impossibilities
- Miss the key distinction between these two categories of low probabilities

The grading appears to be based on the well-established probability weighting function in prospect theory, which shows:
1. **Overweighting of small probabilities**: People give disproportionate weight to low but non-negligible probabilities (the classic example being lottery tickets)
2. **Certainty effect/impossibility effect**: Extremely small probabilities are often ignored entirely or treated as if they have zero probability

The feedback consistently and correctly penalizes students who:
- Claim low probabilities are underestimated rather than overestimated
- Fail to recognize the qualitative difference in how extremely low probabilities are processed
- Miss the distinction between the two categories entirely

The answer key is consistent with Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky's original prospect theory research and subsequent behavioral economics literature.

**The answer key is fine.** The grading accurately reflects the established findings of prospect theory regarding probability weighting, and the feedback appropriately distinguishes between the overweighting of merely low probabilities and the neglect/impossibility treatment of extremely low probabilities.

# Question 8

## Question

When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?

## Answer key

- Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)

## Evaluation

Looking at the student responses and comparing them to the answer key, I believe some responses were unfairly marked as incorrect.

The answer key states that loss aversion means "negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities" or that "the value function is steeper for losses than for gains."

Several student responses demonstrate understanding of the core concept but express it in slightly different language. For example:

- Student responses that mention losses being "weighed more heavily than gains" or losses having "greater impact than equivalent gains" are capturing the essential asymmetric weighting concept.

- Response #44 specifically states: "Loss aversion involves a mistaken perception where losses are perceived as more significant than they actually are, causing them to be weighed more heavily than gains when making decisions or judgments." This directly mentions losses being "weighed more heavily than gains" - which aligns with the answer key.

- Response #40 states: "An equal loss is experienced as more significant than an equivalent gain" - this captures the asymmetric weighting concept.

- Response #21 mentions: "losses are significantly more impactful than equivalent gains" - again showing understanding of the asymmetry.

**Recommendation:** The answer key should be updated to accept responses that demonstrate understanding of the asymmetric weighting concept, even if they don't use the exact technical language of "negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities." 

Specifically, responses should be considered correct if they indicate that:
- Losses are weighted/felt/experienced more heavily/intensely than equivalent gains
- Equal losses have greater impact than equal gains  
- The psychological impact of losses exceeds that of equivalent gains

The current answer key is too restrictive in requiring very specific technical phrasing and fails to recognize when students demonstrate conceptual understanding using alternative but accurate language.

# Question 9

## Question

What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?

## Answer key

- Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
- Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.

## Evaluation

Looking at the student responses and the feedback provided, I can see a pattern of issues with how the answer key is applied, particularly regarding the second main difference between the theories.

## Problems with the Answer Key

The answer key contains a significant conceptual error in its second point. It states that "Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion."

**Issue 1: Mischaracterization of Expected Utility Theory**
Expected utility theory is a normative theory that assumes rational decision-making and does NOT incorporate heuristics and biases. Risk aversion in expected utility theory is modeled through the shape of the utility function (concave for risk aversion), but this is fundamentally different from incorporating "heuristics and biases," which are typically associated with descriptive theories like prospect theory.

**Issue 2: Unfair Penalization of Students**
Several students correctly identified related behavioral concepts but were marked incorrect because they didn't match the specific (incorrect) language in the answer key. For example:
- Students mentioning "loss aversion" were marked wrong because the key specified "risk aversion"
- Students correctly noting that expected utility theory incorporates behavioral considerations were sometimes marked wrong for not using the exact phrase "risk aversion"

**Issue 3: Inconsistent Application**
The feedback shows inconsistent scoring where some students received credit for discussing behavioral aspects generally, while others were penalized for not using the specific term "risk aversion."

## Recommendation

The answer key should be updated as follows:

**Second main difference should be:**
- Expected value theory assumes risk neutrality and linear utility, whereas expected utility theory can accommodate risk aversion through non-linear utility functions (typically concave utility functions that reflect diminishing marginal utility).

This correction would:
1. Accurately reflect the theoretical distinction between the approaches
2. Avoid the conceptual error of claiming expected utility theory incorporates "heuristics and biases"
3. Provide clearer guidance for consistent grading
4. Give appropriate credit to students who demonstrated understanding of the behavioral/preference aspects that distinguish the theories

The first point in the answer key about financial vs. non-financial values appears to be applied correctly and consistently.

# Question 10

## Question

What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.

## Answer key

- Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
- Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn’t need to be financial, but can also subjective
- Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
- Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.

## Evaluation

After reviewing the student responses against the answer key, I found several instances where students were unfairly marked incorrect due to issues with the answer key's specificity and flexibility.

## Issues with the Answer Key:

1. **Overly rigid terminology**: Students who used "prescriptive" instead of "normative" were marked incorrect, even though these terms are often used interchangeably in decision theory literature.

2. **Missing key concepts**: The answer key doesn't explicitly mention that Expected Value Theory and Expected Utility Theory both involve probabilistic outcomes, which is fundamental to both theories. Several students correctly mentioned probabilities but were marked down for not including other details.

3. **Incomplete Expected Value Theory description**: The answer key should clarify that Expected Value Theory involves calculating probability-weighted outcomes, not just "financial outcomes with a probability."

4. **Inconsistent grading of partial understanding**: Some students demonstrated solid understanding of the core concepts but were marked incorrect for minor omissions or slightly different wording.

## Recommendation:

The answer key should be updated as follows:

**Expected Value Theory**: A normative (prescriptive) model for choosing between options by calculating the probability-weighted financial outcomes to maximize expected monetary value.

**Expected Utility Theory**: A normative (prescriptive) model similar to expected value theory, but where outcomes are evaluated based on subjective utility rather than just financial value, also involving probabilistic outcomes.

**Multi-attribute Utility Theory**: A normative (prescriptive) model for choosing between options where each option has multiple attributes, and each attribute is assigned both a utility value and an importance weight.

**Prospect Theory**: A descriptive (behavioral) model similar to expected utility theory, but incorporates psychological factors such as heuristics, biases, loss aversion, and framing effects to better explain actual human decision-making behavior.

The grading should also be more flexible in accepting equivalent terminology (normative/prescriptive) and give credit for demonstrating core understanding even if not all details are perfectly stated.

# Question 11

## Question

How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?

## Answer key

- People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people’s tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.

## Evaluation

Looking at the student responses and comparing them to the answer key, I can see a clear pattern in the grading that reveals a significant issue with the answer key.

**The answer key appears to be incomplete and potentially misleading.**

All student responses were marked incorrect for stating that loss aversion makes people more risk-averse, while the answer key only describes one specific aspect of how loss aversion affects risk preferences - namely, that people become risk-seeking when trying to avoid potential losses.

However, the complete picture of loss aversion's effect on risk preferences includes BOTH aspects:

1. **In the gain domain**: Loss aversion makes people MORE risk-averse (they prefer certain gains over risky prospects with equivalent expected value)

2. **In the loss domain**: Loss aversion makes people LESS risk-averse or even risk-seeking (they prefer risky prospects over certain losses when trying to avoid losses)

Many student responses correctly identified the first relationship but were marked wrong because the answer key only mentions the second relationship. This is a classic finding from prospect theory research - loss aversion affects risk preferences differently depending on whether outcomes are framed as gains or losses.

**Recommendation**: The answer key should be updated to include both effects:

"Loss aversion affects risk preferences in different ways depending on the context. When facing potential gains, loss aversion tends to make people more risk-averse, as they prefer certain outcomes over risky prospects. However, when facing potential losses, loss aversion can decrease people's tendency to be risk-averse and can even make them risk-seeking, as they are willing to accept risk to try to avoid those losses."

Several student responses that mentioned only the gain domain effect should be re-evaluated and likely awarded partial credit, as they captured an important and correct aspect of the relationship between loss aversion and risk preferences.

# Question 12

## Question

What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?

## Answer key

- Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
- Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
- Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

## Evaluation

After reviewing the student responses against the question and answer key, I believe the answer key is **mostly appropriate**, but there are a few instances where students may have been scored too harshly due to the answer key being overly restrictive in its language.

## Issues identified:

1. **Overly narrow definition of conditioning**: Several students described conditioning as "forming connections," "linking stimuli," or "learning relationships between variables" - all of which capture the essence of associative learning but were marked incorrect because they didn't use the exact phrase "learning associations through covariation." These responses demonstrate understanding of the core concept.

2. **Classical conditioning scoring**: Some students accurately described the temporal/spatial co-occurrence aspect of classical conditioning using different but correct terminology (e.g., "when things happen together," "connecting events that trigger responses") but were marked down for not matching the exact wording.

3. **One clear reversal was correctly identified**: Student #10 clearly reversed the definitions of classical and operant conditioning, which was appropriately marked as incorrect.

## Recommendation:

The answer key should be updated to accept conceptually equivalent descriptions:

**Updated Answer Key:**
- **Conditioning**: Learning associations/connections/relationships between events through their co-occurrence or covariation
- **Classical conditioning**: Learning associations when two stimuli/events occur together in time and space (temporal/spatial contiguity)
- **Operant conditioning**: Learning that actions/behaviors lead to consequences (rewards or punishments)

This would allow credit for students who demonstrate conceptual understanding using slightly different but accurate terminology, while still maintaining the core scientific concepts that need to be demonstrated.

# Question 13

## Question

What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?

## Answer key

- Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

## Evaluation

After reviewing the student responses against the answer key, I believe the answer key contains a significant error that has led to unfair grading of several student responses.

The main issue is with the definition of **illusory causation** in the answer key. The answer key states that illusory causation is "when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship." However, many students who defined illusory causation as "perceiving causation where none exists" were marked incorrect, when this is actually a valid and commonly accepted definition of illusory causation in psychology.

**Examples of unfairly marked responses:**

- Student response #4: "Illusory causation occurs when we mistakenly believe that one event causes another, even though no such cause-and-effect relationship exists" - This is a correct definition but was marked wrong.

- Student response #18: "In illusory correlations, individuals perceive relationships between things that are not really there. In illusory causations, individuals believe one event causes another when no such cause-and-effect relationship exists" - The illusory correlation part is correct, and the illusory causation part is also valid.

- Student response #30: "Illusory causation is perceiving a cause-and-effect relationship between two events when none actually exists" - This is accurate but marked incorrect.

**Recommendation:**

The answer key should be updated to accept both definitions of illusory causation:
1. The current definition: "when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship" 
2. The broader definition: "when a causal relationship is perceived between events where no such relationship actually exists"

Both definitions are psychologically valid - illusory causation can occur when misinterpreting correlations as causal AND when perceiving causation in the complete absence of any relationship. Several student responses should be re-graded with partial or full credit based on this correction.

The definition of illusory correlation in the answer key appears accurate and the grading for that concept seems fair.

# Question 14

## Question

When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‘properly’ behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?

## Answer key

- Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
- Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

## Evaluation

After reviewing the student responses against the answer key, I believe the answer key has some issues that may have led to unfair grading.

## Problems with the Answer Key

The main issue is that the answer key's definitions and explanations are somewhat unclear and inconsistent with standard cognitive psychology terminology:

1. **Schema definition is too narrow**: The answer key defines schema as "knowledge and relationships between things," but many students provided reasonable alternative explanations (e.g., "mental framework," "general knowledge about a subject," "structured understanding") that were marked incorrect.

2. **Script definition conflates concepts**: The answer key calls scripts "social schemas that describe how you should behave in a specific situation," but then marks students incorrect for similar explanations that don't use this exact phrasing.

## Unfairly Marked Responses

Several students were unfairly penalized:

- **Student 11**: Correctly identified healthcare system as schema because it "represents general knowledge we have about a subject" - this is a valid explanation but was marked as needing the specific "relationships between things" language.

- **Student 17**: Used "framework" instead of "schema" for healthcare system but demonstrated correct conceptual understanding.

- **Multiple students**: Provided accurate conceptual explanations for scripts (e.g., "sequence of actions," "behavioral expectations in specific situations," "culturally shaped rules") but were marked down for not using the exact answer key language.

## Recommendation

**Update the answer key to accept conceptually correct explanations rather than requiring exact terminology.** For example:

- **Schema (healthcare system)**: Accept explanations that describe it as organized knowledge, mental frameworks, general knowledge about a domain, or understanding relationships/structures - not just "relationships between things"

- **Script (birthday party)**: Accept explanations that describe behavioral sequences, expected actions in specific situations, social behavioral guidelines, or culturally-defined conduct - not just the specific "social schema" phrasing

The current answer key is too rigid and doesn't recognize that students can demonstrate understanding using different but equivalent terminology.

# Question 15

## Question

Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?

## Answer key

- Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.

## Evaluation

Looking at the student responses and comparing them to the answer key, I can see several patterns in the scoring that raise concerns about fairness.

## Issues with the Answer Key

**1. Overly Restrictive Reasoning Requirement**

Several students correctly identified the physical stance but were marked incorrect due to incomplete or slightly different explanations. For example:

- Student #15: "Behaviourists would take the physical perspective, since it emphasizes observing the subject's behavior or physical characteristics." - Marked 0/0
- Student #19: "Behaviorists embraced the physical standpoint because they believed that only observable phenomena can be measured." - Marked 0/0

These responses demonstrate understanding of the core concept but don't specifically mention "processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior."

**2. Inconsistent Treatment of Terminology**

Many students used equivalent terms like "mechanical stance/approach" which captures the same conceptual understanding as "physical stance" but were marked incorrect solely for terminology differences.

**3. Partial Credit Not Awarded**

Students who correctly identified key behaviorist principles (rejection of mental states, focus on observable behavior, stimulus-response relationships) but misidentified the stance received no credit, even when showing substantial understanding.

## Recommendation

The answer key should be updated to:

1. **Accept correct identification of physical stance with reasonable explanations** - Award full credit when students correctly identify the physical stance and demonstrate understanding that behaviorists focused on observable, measurable stimulus-response relationships, even if they don't use the exact phrasing about "processes that caused stimuli to result in behavior."

2. **Award partial credit** - Give partial credit (e.g., 50%) to students who demonstrate clear understanding of behaviorist principles (rejection of mental states, focus on observable behavior) but misidentify the stance.

3. **Accept equivalent terminology** - Accept "mechanical stance/approach" as equivalent to "physical stance" when the explanation is otherwise correct.

The current answer key is too rigid and penalizes students who demonstrate conceptual understanding but don't match the exact expected response format.

# Question 16

## Question

Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet’s stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?

## Answer key

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.

## Evaluation

Looking at the student responses and comparing them to the answer key, I believe some students were unfairly marked as incorrect. The answer key is too restrictive in requiring the exact terminology "design stance."

Several students demonstrated clear understanding of the core concept that evolutionary psychologists analyze psychological processes in terms of their function/purpose, but used equivalent terminology like:

- "functional perspective" 
- "functional approach"
- "utility or functionality perspective"
- "take a functional approach, explaining psychological behaviors in terms of their purpose"

These responses show the students understood that:
1. Evolutionary psychologists focus on function/purpose/utility
2. They analyze psychological processes from this functional perspective
3. This explains why behaviors like ingroup favoritism are considered beneficial

The students correctly identified the key insight that evolutionary psychology examines "what something is designed to do" rather than "how it works mechanistically" or "what beliefs/desires drive it." They simply used the more accessible term "functional" instead of Dennett's technical term "design stance."

**Recommendation:** Update the answer key to accept equivalent functional terminology, such as:

- Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance (or functional perspective/approach) because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function/purpose/utility.

This would give credit to students who demonstrated conceptual understanding while using slightly different but accurate terminology. The core learning objective is understanding the level of analysis, not memorizing Dennett's specific labels.

However, students who incorrectly identified the "intentional stance" or other non-functional approaches were appropriately marked incorrect, as this shows fundamental misunderstanding of evolutionary psychology's approach.

# Question 17

## Question

To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.

## Answer key

- Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
- Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
- Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
- Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
- Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.

## Evaluation

Looking at the student responses and the feedback provided, I can see several issues with how the answer key was applied:

## Issues with the Answer Key Application

1. **Overly strict scoring for examples**: The first student response provided a detailed example of cat purring when petted, which actually demonstrates understanding of multiple heuristics (consistency, contiguity, plausibility) but received 0 points because they didn't explicitly name the heuristics. This seems unfair - the student clearly understood the concepts even if they didn't use the exact terminology.

2. **Inconsistent interpretation of "consistency"**: Some students were marked correct for describing consistency as "B reliably happens whenever A occurs" while others were marked incorrect for saying "A typically happens before B" or "A regularly occurs with B." The feedback seems inconsistent about whether "always" is required or if "typically/regularly" is acceptable.

3. **Confusion about contiguity**: The answer key states A and B occur "at the same time and in the same location," but some students were marked incorrect for describing temporal sequence (A before B) when causation typically does involve temporal precedence. The simultaneity requirement seems questionable for causal relationships.

4. **Similarity heuristic interpretation**: Students who mentioned "similarity" or "resemblance" were sometimes marked correct and sometimes incorrect, with inconsistent application of whether "superficial resemblance" was required.

## Recommendation

The answer key should be updated to:

1. **Accept demonstrations through examples**: Students who clearly demonstrate understanding of the heuristics through appropriate examples (like the cat purring example) should receive partial credit even without explicit naming.

2. **Clarify consistency requirements**: Accept both "always" and "typically/regularly" for consistency, as the core concept is reliability of the A-B relationship.

3. **Revise contiguity definition**: Clarify that contiguity includes both simultaneous occurrence AND temporal precedence with spatial proximity, as pure simultaneity doesn't align with typical causal relationships.

4. **Be more flexible with similarity**: Accept various formulations of resemblance between cause and effect, not just "superficial resemblance."

The current answer key appears too rigid and doesn't adequately credit students who demonstrate conceptual understanding through different but valid expressions of the same ideas.

# Question 18

## Question

We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?

## Answer key

- The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
- The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
- By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.

## Evaluation

Looking at the student responses and comparing them to the answer key, I notice a consistent pattern that suggests the answer key may be incomplete or too restrictive.

**The Answer Key Appears to be Fine**

After reviewing all the incorrect student responses, the answer key correctly identifies the two primary biases:

1. **Negativity bias** - the tendency to seek out or place more weight on negative information
2. **Availability heuristic** - estimating frequency based on ease of recall

The key issue is not with the answer key itself, but with the students' understanding. The most common errors I observed were:

- **Substituting confirmation bias for one of the required biases** (appearing in about 40% of responses) - while confirmation bias is related, it doesn't explain the specific mechanism of frequency overestimation
- **Misidentifying the second bias** with concepts like representativeness heuristic, hindsight bias, or mere exposure effect
- **Failing to explain the causal relationship** between how negativity bias increases exposure to moral outrage content, which then makes such examples more mentally available for the availability heuristic to operate on

The students who received partial credit typically identified one bias correctly but missed the other or failed to explain their interaction. Those who received no credit either identified completely wrong biases or provided no substantive answer.

The answer key appropriately requires both specific biases and an explanation of their interaction, which is essential for full understanding of this psychological phenomenon.

**Recommendation: The answer key is fine and does not need updating.**

# Question 19

## Question

One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?

## Answer key

- The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.

## Evaluation

Looking at the student responses and comparing them to the answer key, I believe the answer key is **too restrictive and incomplete**. Several student responses demonstrate correct understanding of the core concept but were unfairly marked incorrect.

## Problems with the current answer key:

1. **Student #15** provides a substantially correct answer: "Framework theories propose that individuals naturally function within various domains such as physics, biology, or psychology... people mistakenly transfer rules from one domain to another, leading to beliefs like thinking that the negative mental states of a disliked person possess a physical quality capable of contaminating their possessions. This reflects the incorrect application of physical laws related to mechanics and materials to the psychological realm."

   This student correctly identifies:
   - Framework theories and domain-specific knowledge
   - Cross-domain misapplication as the mechanism
   - The psychological realm as the target domain
   
   While they identify "physics/mechanics" rather than "biology" as the source domain, they demonstrate clear understanding of the fundamental concept.

2. **Student #27** also shows partial understanding: "This can be attributed to a confusion or blending between two fields of knowledge, namely the biological and the physical domains." They correctly identify biological domain involvement and cross-domain confusion, though they misidentify the target domain.

3. **Multiple students** (e.g., #13, #40, #51, #52) correctly identify the mechanism of cross-domain application and framework theories but may specify slightly different domains or use equivalent terminology.

## Recommendation for updating the answer key:

**Expanded Answer Key:**
- **Full credit:** The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social/psychological/cultural domain
- **Partial credit:** Responses that correctly identify:
  - Cross-domain misapplication of framework theories, AND
  - Either the biological source domain OR the social/psychological target domain
  - Use of equivalent terms (e.g., "contamination," "infection," "disease transmission" for biological concepts; "interpersonal," "cultural," "personal" for social/psychological concepts)

This would better recognize students who understand the core theoretical concept even if they don't use the exact terminology from the original answer key.

# Question 20

## Question

What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?

## Answer key

- A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.

## Evaluation

After reviewing the student responses against the answer key, I found that several students were unfairly marked as incorrect. Many students correctly identified one of the two key criteria but were penalized for not mentioning both.

**Students who were scored unfairly:**

Several students correctly identified that delusional conspiracy theories are characterized by being "not commonly accepted" or lacking "cultural acceptance," which directly aligns with the answer key's criterion. However, they were marked incorrect solely for not mentioning the "irrational belief" component.

Similarly, some students correctly identified that delusional conspiracy theories involve "irrational beliefs" but were marked incorrect for not mentioning the social acceptance component.

**Recommendation for updating the answer key:**

The current answer key should be revised to allow partial credit for students who correctly identify either one of the two key criteria. I recommend:

1. **Full credit (100%):** Students who identify both criteria - that delusional conspiracy theories are both irrational beliefs AND not commonly accepted

2. **Partial credit (50%):** Students who correctly identify only one of the two criteria:
   - Those who mention that delusional theories are "irrational" or "illogical" 
   - Those who mention that delusional theories are "not commonly/culturally accepted" or "rejected by society"

3. **No credit (0%):** Students who focus entirely on irrelevant factors like evidence quality, supernatural elements, or other criteria not mentioned in the answer key

This approach would be more fair as it recognizes that students demonstrating partial understanding of the concept should receive some credit rather than being penalized completely for an incomplete but partially correct response.

# Question 21

## Question

During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?

## Answer key

- 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

## Evaluation

After carefully reviewing the student responses against the answer key, I believe the answer key is **fine** and the grading appears to be fair.

The student responses consistently demonstrate several patterns that justify their low scores:

1. **Responses citing legitimate psychological concepts not in the answer key**: Many students mentioned factors like neuroticism, confirmation bias, availability heuristic, and agreeableness. While these are valid psychological concepts that could plausibly relate to conspiratorial thinking, they are not among the specific factors that were apparently covered in the lecture. Since the question explicitly asks for factors "reviewed during the lecture," students needed to recall the specific content presented.

2. **Responses that are too vague or general**: Students provided answers like "false beliefs," "irrational thoughts," or "mental misconceptions" which don't demonstrate knowledge of the specific cognitive and personality factors taught.

3. **Responses focusing on outcomes rather than contributing factors**: Some students described consequences of conspiratorial thinking (feeling isolated, disconnected) rather than the factors that lead to it.

4. **Responses citing socioeconomic or external factors**: Many mentioned education level, income, or social factors, but the question specifically asked for "cognitive and personality factors."

The answer key appears to represent a specific set of research-based factors that were covered in the lecture. The grading correctly identifies that students needed to demonstrate knowledge of these particular factors rather than general knowledge about conspiracy theories or related psychological concepts.

The answer key is appropriate and the grading appears fair and consistent.

# Question 22

## Question

If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don’t know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?

## Answer key

- Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)

## Evaluation

Looking at the student responses and comparing them to the answer key, I can see that the grading appears to be fair and consistent. The answer key clearly specifies three acceptable psychological mechanisms:

1. **Source amnesia** (primary answer) - forgetting that your provided answer was incorrect and mistaking it for the correct answer
2. **Proactive interference** (alternative) - initial incorrect answer interfering with the later correct answer  
3. **Continued-influence effect** (alternative) - general term for this phenomenon

Reviewing the incorrect student responses, I see they provided various other psychological concepts such as:
- Primacy effect
- Availability heuristic  
- Anchoring and adjustment
- Hindsight bias
- Confirmation bias
- Classical/operant conditioning
- Belief perseverance
- Curse of knowledge

While some of these concepts are psychologically valid and a few (like "context amnesia") come close to the correct answer, none directly address the specific mechanism asked about in the question. The question specifically asks how incorrect answers during self-quizzing can **interfere with learning**, and the answer key correctly identifies the precise cognitive mechanisms responsible for this interference.

One student did mention "context amnesia" which shows some understanding, but this is not the same as "source amnesia" - the former refers to forgetting circumstances around events, while the latter specifically refers to forgetting the source/accuracy status of information.

The feedback provided to students is also appropriate, clearly explaining why their answers don't match the required mechanisms and pointing them toward the correct concepts.

**The answer key is fine.** The grading appears fair and consistent with the specific psychological mechanisms that explain how incorrect quiz answers interfere with learning the correct information.

# Question 23

## Question

Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?

## Answer key

- Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

## Evaluation

Looking at the student responses and the feedback provided, I believe the answer key is largely appropriate, but there are a few cases where students may have been unfairly penalized.

## Potentially Unfairly Scored Responses:

**Student Response #2 and #61:** "Simply being exposed"
- These students clearly identified the core concept of "exposure" which directly relates to the "mere exposure effect"
- While incomplete, they demonstrated understanding of the fundamental mechanism
- **Recommendation:** Consider awarding partial credit (e.g., 50%) for identifying the key concept even without the full terminology

**Student Response #24:** "The more often we encounter certain information, the more inclined we become to believe it is true..."
- This student accurately described the illusory-truth effect mechanism, even though they mislabeled it as "indoctrination"
- They correctly explained that repeated exposure increases perceived truthfulness
- **Recommendation:** This should receive partial or full credit as the student demonstrated clear understanding of one of the accepted mechanisms

**Student Response #30:** "The mere exposure effect refers to the phenomenon where information we encounter more frequently becomes more readily accessible in our minds."
- The student correctly identified "mere exposure effect" by name
- While their definition focused on accessibility rather than preference, they named the exact psychological mechanism from the answer key
- **Recommendation:** This should receive significant partial credit for correctly identifying the mechanism, even with an imperfect definition

**Student Response #58:** "Through repeated exposure"
- Similar to responses #2 and #61, this student identified the core concept
- **Recommendation:** Consider partial credit for demonstrating understanding of the basic mechanism

## Answer Key Recommendation:

The answer key should be updated to include a partial credit rubric:
- **Full credit:** Correctly identifies "mere exposure effect" or "illusory-truth effect" with accurate explanation
- **Partial credit (70-80%):** Correctly identifies the mechanism by name but with incomplete/imperfect explanation
- **Partial credit (40-50%):** Demonstrates understanding of the core concept (repeated exposure, familiarity) without using precise terminology
- **No credit:** Identifies incorrect mechanisms or fails to demonstrate understanding

The current binary scoring system may be too harsh for students who demonstrate conceptual understanding but lack precise terminology.

# Question 24

## Question

People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?

## Answer key

- No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.

## Evaluation

Looking at the student responses and comparing them to the answer key, I notice a significant pattern that suggests potential issues with the grading.

The answer key states that people with major depressive disorder are "more accurate" at making predictions about negative events due to "reduced tendency to be overly optimistic."

However, many student responses demonstrate understanding of key relevant concepts but reach different conclusions about accuracy. Several students show awareness of important psychological principles:

1. **Students who correctly identified reduced optimism bias**: Multiple students (e.g., responses #11, #34, #58, #65) correctly noted that people with depression show reduced positivity/optimism bias, but were marked incorrect for concluding this makes them "less accurate" rather than "more accurate."

2. **Students who understood the mechanism but disagreed on accuracy**: Response #34 particularly stands out - the student correctly explains that people with depression "are less prone to displaying a positivity bias" but concludes they are "less precise," which was marked wrong.

3. **Conceptual confusion in the answer key**: The distinction between "bias" and "accuracy" appears to be causing confusion. Students may reasonably interpret that any bias (whether optimistic or pessimistic) reduces accuracy, while the answer key treats reduced optimism bias as increased accuracy.

**Recommendation**: The answer key should be updated to acknowledge that this is a nuanced topic where reasonable arguments can be made for different positions. Specifically:

- Accept answers that correctly identify the mechanism (reduced optimism bias in depression) regardless of whether students conclude this increases or decreases "accuracy"
- Give credit for responses that demonstrate understanding of depressive realism concepts
- Consider that the term "accuracy" itself may be ambiguous - students might interpret it as "objective accuracy" rather than "realistic assessment compared to overly optimistic controls"

The current grading appears too rigid given the complexity of this psychological phenomenon and the reasonable interpretations students are providing.

# Question 25

## Question

In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?

## Answer key

- When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

## Evaluation

Looking at the student responses and the feedback provided, I need to evaluate whether any students were unfairly marked incorrect.

After reviewing all the responses, I found that **some students were unfairly penalized**. Specifically:

**Student 2** demonstrates a solid understanding of the core concept. They write: "According to Bayesian statistics, our posterior belief is a weighted combination of prior knowledge and new evidence. When the evidence is uncertain, the prior knowledge plays a stronger role in shaping the posterior belief than the evidence does."

This is fundamentally correct - they clearly state that prior knowledge plays a stronger role when evidence is uncertain, which directly answers the question. The feedback criticizes them for an unclear first sentence, but their second sentence demonstrates they understand the key concept that prior beliefs have greater influence when sensory information is unreliable.

**Student 14** also shows partial understanding, correctly stating: "prior beliefs take precedence while sensory information becomes less influential" when sensory reliability decreases. While they add an incorrect conclusion about "no change in your prior belief," their core understanding of the relationship is accurate.

**Student 20** correctly identifies both the mechanism and outcome: "When the evidence is less reliable, the prior belief is updated to a smaller extent. This results in the prior belief having a stronger and more prominent impact." The feedback criticizes their description of the mechanism, but their understanding of the fundamental relationship is sound.

**Recommendation**: The answer key should be updated to allow partial credit for responses that correctly identify the core relationship (that prior beliefs have greater influence when sensory reliability decreases), even if the explanation of the underlying mechanism is imperfect or if additional incorrect information is included. Students 2, 14, and 20 should receive partial credit rather than zero points, as they demonstrate understanding of the key concept being tested.

# Question 26

## Question

According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don’t need to describe these stages.)

## Answer key

- Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people’s feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
- Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)

## Evaluation

After reviewing the student responses against the answer key, I believe the answer key is **fine** as written.

The student responses that were marked incorrect demonstrate clear misunderstandings of Kohlberg's theory rather than being unfairly penalized due to problems with the answer key. Here's why:

1. **Pre-conventional Level**: Students who received credit correctly identified the focus on rewards/punishments or self-interest, which aligns with the answer key. Those who didn't receive credit described concepts like "personal feelings," "mutual benefit," or "personal beliefs" - none of which capture the essential punishment-avoidance/reward-seeking orientation.

2. **Conventional Level**: Students who received credit correctly identified social norms, societal expectations, or concern for others' perceptions. Those marked incorrect described concepts like "learning from errors," "personal beliefs," or gave overly vague descriptions that missed the social conformity aspect.

3. **Post-conventional Level**: The few students who addressed this level typically described perspective-taking or bias reduction, which are not the same as Kohlberg's emphasis on abstract moral principles and universal values that transcend social conventions.

The answer key appropriately captures the core distinctions between Kohlberg's three levels: external consequences (pre-conventional), social approval/norms (conventional), and universal principles (post-conventional). The grading appears consistent and fair based on these criteria.

The answer key does not need to be updated.

# Question 27

## Question

What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?

## Answer key

- A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
- Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

## Evaluation

Looking at the student responses and the feedback provided, I need to evaluate whether the answer key fairly assessed these responses.

The answer key requires two components:
1. A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past events are related
2. Events that are part of a causal model seem more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias

After reviewing the student responses and feedback, I believe there are some issues with how strictly the answer key was applied, particularly regarding the first component.

## Issues with the Answer Key Application:

**Problem 1: Overly restrictive definition of "causal model"**

Many students received failing scores on the first component for providing accurate descriptions of causal models that didn't use the exact phrase "coherent narrative." For example:

- Students who described causal models as "cause-and-effect relationships between events" or "logical explanations of how events are connected" were marked incorrect
- Students who said causal models involve "seeing connections between events" or "understanding reasons behind events" were penalized

These responses demonstrate understanding of the core concept - that causal models explain how events relate to and influence each other - even without using the specific terminology from the answer key.

**Problem 2: Inconsistent application**

The feedback shows some inconsistency in what constitutes an acceptable definition. Some responses mentioning "cause-and-effect relationships" were accepted while very similar responses were rejected.

## Recommendation:

The answer key should be updated to accept broader but conceptually accurate definitions of causal models, such as:

- Explanations of cause-and-effect relationships between past events
- Logical frameworks connecting how events relate to each other  
- Stories or explanations that link past events through causal relationships
- Narratives showing how events influenced or led to other events

The core concept being tested is whether students understand that causal models organize and connect past events through causal relationships - not whether they use the specific phrase "coherent narrative."

The second component about inevitability was generally assessed fairly, with appropriate credit given to students who explained that causal models make events seem more predictable, unavoidable, or inevitable than they actually were.

# Question 28

## Question

How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?

## Answer key

- While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).

## Evaluation

After carefully reviewing the student responses against the answer key, I believe the answer key is **too restrictive** and some student responses were unfairly marked as incorrect.

## Issues with the Current Answer Key:

The answer key focuses on one very specific mechanism: "While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account." However, several student responses demonstrate accurate understanding of how learning contributes to hindsight bias, even if they don't use this exact terminology.

## Students Who Should Receive Partial or Full Credit:

**Student 1** explains that learning about outcomes "makes us believe the event was predictable," which captures the core mechanism - new knowledge contaminates our retrospective judgments.

**Student 4** states "when we acquire new information, we often convince ourselves that we already knew it beforehand" - this directly addresses how learning creates the inability to separate new knowledge from past beliefs.

**Student 10** correctly identifies that "learning reveals the result...leading people to believe they predicted it all along" - showing understanding that new information distorts retrospective judgment.

**Student 26** notes that after learning, "the outcome appears obvious after the fact" - demonstrating understanding of how new knowledge makes past events seem more predictable than they actually were.

## Recommendation:

**Update the answer key to accept multiple valid explanations of the mechanism**, including:
- New information makes outcomes seem more predictable in hindsight
- Learning about outcomes leads people to believe they "knew it all along"
- Newly acquired knowledge contaminates our ability to accurately recall what we previously thought
- After learning outcomes, people cannot separate their current knowledge from their past beliefs
- The specific mechanism about "estimating past likelihood judgments" (current answer key)

The question asks broadly "How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?" and should accept any accurate explanation of the underlying cognitive mechanism, not just one specific theoretical formulation.

# Question 29

## Question

Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?

## Answer key

- Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
- Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
- If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style

## Evaluation

Looking at the student responses and the grading feedback, I believe the answer key is **fine** and the grading was fair.

The student responses demonstrate clear understanding issues that justify the low scores:

**Student 1**: While they correctly identified the neuroticism-maximizing connection, they failed to provide proper definitions of the two decision styles as explicitly requested in the question. The question asks to "briefly describe" both styles, which requires actual definitions, not just implications about their usage.

**Student 2**: This response shows fundamental misunderstanding of both concepts, confusing decision styles with risk-taking behavior, and incorrectly linking high neuroticism to satisficing when research supports the opposite relationship.

**Student 3**: This response is clearly incomplete and inadequate, providing only a single word that doesn't even directly address any part of the three-part question.

The answer key appropriately captures the essential elements:
- Clear, concise definitions of both decision styles
- The correct research-based relationship between neuroticism and maximizing behavior

The grading feedback demonstrates that partial credit was appropriately awarded where students got some elements correct (e.g., Student 1 received 1 point for correctly identifying the neuroticism-maximizing relationship despite missing the definitions).

The answer key accurately reflects the standard academic understanding of these psychological concepts and provides clear criteria for evaluation.

# Question 30

## Question

Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)

## Answer key

- Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.

## Evaluation

Looking at these student responses and comparing them to the answer key, I believe the answer key is **too restrictive** and some students were unfairly penalized.

## Issues with Current Scoring:

**Students 6 and 7 were unfairly marked incorrect.** Both provided concrete, relevant teaching strategies:

- **Student 6** suggested peer assessment and AI-based grading tools - both directly address the core constraint of limited time/resources while maintaining student engagement
- **Student 7** proposed using group assignments with individual accountability measures - a legitimate pedagogical approach for resource-constrained environments

These responses demonstrate understanding of the teaching challenge and offer practical solutions, which should qualify as "serious engagement."

**Students 4 and 5** present borderline cases that merit reconsideration:
- **Student 4** addresses attendance (a component of engagement) with a specific strategy
- **Student 5** references a psychological principle (recency effect) applied to student motivation

While brief, these responses show some engagement with the pedagogical challenge.

## Recommendation:

**Update the answer key to be more specific about evaluation criteria:**

- Responses should demonstrate understanding that this is a **teaching scenario** (not personal decision-making)
- Answers should address **student engagement strategies** and/or **resource-efficient assessment methods**
- Responses can be brief if they contain relevant, practical suggestions
- Credit should be given for any pedagogically sound approach, even if simple

**Suggested revision:** "Any answer that demonstrates understanding of the teaching context and proposes relevant strategies for student engagement or resource-efficient assessment methods will receive credit, regardless of length or complexity."

Students 6 and 7 should definitely receive credit, and Students 4 and 5 deserve reconsideration under revised criteria.
