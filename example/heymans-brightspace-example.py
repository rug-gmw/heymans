# Heymans example workflow for Brightspace

This notebook provides an example workflow for using Heymans as a Python library to grade open-ended exams in combination with the Brightspace learning environment.

## Getting started

Import relevant libraries and specify model. Ideally, you set API keys through environment variables. You can also specify your API directly in the code below. Make sure that you do not accidentally make your API key publicly available though!

You can install Heymans and all dependencies from PyPi:

```
pip install heymans
```
"""
import json
from pathlib import Path
from sigmund import config as sigmund_config
from heymans import convert, quizzes, report

# Anthropic setings
# If available, the ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable is used
if sigmund_config.anthropic_api_key is None:  
    sigmund_config.anthropic_api_key = 'your API key here (never share!)'
MODEL = 'claude-3.5-sonnet'

# OpenAI settings
# If available, the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable is used
# if sigmund_config.openai_api_key is None:
#     sigmund_config.openai_api_key = 'your API key here (never share!)'
# MODEL = 'gpt-4o'

# Mistral settings
# If available, the MISTRAL_API_KEY environment variable is used
# if sigmund_config.mistral_api_key is None:
#     sigmund_config.mistral_api_key = 'your API key here (never share!)'
# MODEL = 'mistral-large'
print(f'Heymans will use {MODEL}')



# % output
# Heymans will use claude-3.5-sonnet
# 
"""
## Preparing the exam

### Writing the exam

The exam should be written in the Markdown format as used in `example/exam-questions.md`.

### Validating the exam

Once you have written the exam, you can validate it. This means that Heymans will inspect all questions and their answer keys, and provide suggestions for improvement. You'll find that Heymans typically has many suggestions, and you do not need to implement them all. Rather, use these suggestions as a starting point for your own careful evaluation.

# # Question 1
# 
# ## Question
# 
# According to Jonathan Haidt‚Äôs social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
# 
# ## Answer key
# 
# - System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
# - System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
# - System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).
# 
# ## Evaluation
# 
# I'm ready to grade the student's answer based on the answer key provided. Each element will receive a pass/fail score and motivation. Please provide the student's answer, and I will respond with a JSON string containing exactly 3 scores and motivations, one for each bullet point from the answer key.
# 
# # Question 2
# 
# ## Question
# 
# Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
# 
# ## Answer key
# 
# - The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
# - The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).
# 
# ## Evaluation
# 
# I'm ready to grade the student's answer based on the answer key. The response will be in JSON format containing:
# 1. A pass/fail assessment for identification of the representativeness heuristic
# 2. A pass/fail assessment for correctly explaining how the representativeness heuristic works
# 
# Please provide the student's answer.
# 
# # Question 3
# 
# ## Question
# 
# What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
# 
# ## Answer key
# 
# - Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
# - The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
# - Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information
# 
# ## Evaluation
# 
# I'm ready to grade the student's answer about anchoring and the primacy effect once you provide it. I'll evaluate it against the 2-point answer key:
# 1. Anchoring definition
# 2. Primacy effect definition and comparison with anchoring
# 
# I'll provide my assessment in JSON format with pass/fail scores and motivations for each point.
# 
# Please share the student's answer.
# 
# # Question 4
# 
# ## Question
# 
# What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
# 
# ## Answer key
# 
# - Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
# - Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.
# 
# ## Evaluation
# 
# I'm ready to grade the student's answer based on the answer key provided. The answer key consists of two elements:
# 
# 1. Definition of loss aversion
# 2. Definition/distinction of risk aversion
# 
# I'll wait for the student's answer and provide a JSON response evaluating each element with pass/fail scores and motivations.
# 
# # Question 5
# 
# ## Question
# 
# What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
# 
# ## Answer key
# 
# - Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
# - Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.
# 
# ## Evaluation
# 
# I'm ready to grade the student's answer about impact bias based on the answer key provided. I'll assess:
# 1. Whether they explain impact bias as overestimating the impact of future events on feelings
# 2. Whether they include the break-up example or a similar valid example
# 
# Please share the student's answer and I'll provide a JSON response with pass/fail scores and motivations for each element.
# 
# # Question 6
# 
# ## Question
# 
# What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
# 
# ## Answer key
# 
# - Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
# - Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.
# 
# ## Evaluation
# 
# I'm ready to grade the student's answer based on the answer key you've provided. The answer key has 2 key points:
# 
# 1. Definition of affective forecasting as predictions about future emotional states
# 2. Example about health/sickness preferences changing between prediction and reality
# 
# Please provide the student's answer and I will evaluate it according to these criteria using the JSON format requested.
# 
# # Question 7
# 
# ## Question
# 
# According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
# 
# ## Answer key
# 
# - Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
# - Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.
# 
# ## Evaluation
# 
# I'm ready to evaluate the student's answer based on those 2 points from the answer key, using the JSON format you specified. I'll assess whether their response correctly addresses both:
# 1. Low probabilities being overestimated
# 2. Extremely low probabilities being interpreted as impossibilities
# 
# Please provide the student's answer and I'll grade it accordingly with pass/fail scores and brief motivations for each point.
# 
# # Question 8
# 
# ## Question
# 
# When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
# 
# ## Answer key
# 
# - Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)
# 
# ## Evaluation
# 
# I'm ready to grade the student's answer based on the answer key once you provide the student response. I will evaluate whether the answer correctly conveys that:
# 
# 1. Loss aversion means negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities (or that the value function is steeper for losses than gains)
# 
# I will provide my evaluation in the requested JSON format, with a pass/fail score and motivation for this element.
# 
# # Question 9
# 
# ## Question
# 
# What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
# 
# ## Answer key
# 
# - Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
# - Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.
# 
# ## Evaluation
# 
# I'll wait for the student's answer before providing a JSON evaluation based on the answer key points you shared. The evaluation will assess whether the answer correctly addresses:
# 
# 1. The distinction between expected value (financial only) vs. expected utility (financial + non-financial)
# 2. How expected utility accounts for risk aversion while expected value doesn't
# 
# I'll format the response as a JSON with pass/fail scores and motivations for each point.
# 
# # Question 10
# 
# ## Question
# 
# What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
# 
# ## Answer key
# 
# - Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
# - Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn‚Äôt need to be financial, but can also subjective
# - Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
# - Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.
# 
# ## Evaluation
# 
# I'll help grade the student answer against the answer key when you provide it. I will use this format:
# 
# {

# 
# # Question 11
# 
# ## Question
# 
# How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
# 
# ## Answer key
# 
# - People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people‚Äôs tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.
# 
# ## Evaluation
# 
# I'm ready to evaluate the student's answer based on the two key points:
# 1. People accept risk to avoid loss
# 2. Loss aversion can decrease risk aversion and lead to risk-seeking behavior
# 
# Please provide the student's answer and I will respond with the JSON evaluation.
# 
# # Question 12
# 
# ## Question
# 
# What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
# 
# ## Answer key
# 
# - Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
# - Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
# - Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.
# 
# ## Evaluation
# 
# I'm ready to grade the student answer based on the answer key you provided. The response will include:
# 
# 1. Whether they defined conditioning as learning through covariation
# 2. Whether they correctly explained classical conditioning
# 3. Whether they correctly explained operant conditioning
# 
# Each element will include a pass/fail score and motivation. Please provide the student's answer.
# 
# # Question 13
# 
# ## Question
# 
# What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
# 
# ## Answer key
# 
# - Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.
# 
# ## Evaluation
# 
# I'm ready to evaluate the student's answer based on your provided answer key. The answer key mentions two distinct phenomena:
# 
# 1. Illusory causation - incorrectly interpreting correlation as causation
# 2. Illusory correlation - perceiving a correlation that doesn't exist
# 
# I'll wait for the student's answer and provide a JSON response evaluating how well they covered these concepts.
# 
# # Question 14
# 
# ## Question
# 
# When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‚Äòproperly‚Äô behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
# 
# ## Answer key
# 
# - Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
# - Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation
# 
# ## Evaluation
# 
# I'm ready to grade the student's answer and provide a JSON response according to the answer key, with 2 pass/fail elements and their motivations. Please provide the student's answer.
# 
# # Question 15
# 
# ## Question
# 
# Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet‚Äôs stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
# 
# ## Answer key
# 
# - Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.
# 
# ## Evaluation
# 
# I'm ready to grade the student response based on the answer key about behaviorists and the physical stance. I'll evaluate whether the student's answer correctly addresses:
# 1. That behaviorists adopted the physical stance
# 2. Their focus on stimulus-behavior processes/causes
# 
# Please provide the student's answer and I'll respond with the requested JSON format evaluating these points.
# 
# # Question 16
# 
# ## Question
# 
# Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet‚Äôs stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
# 
# ## Answer key
# 
# - Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.
# 
# ## Evaluation
# 
# I'm ready to grade the student's answer according to the provided answer key with 2 main elements:
# 
# 1. Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance
# 2. They consider psychological processes in terms of their function
# 
# Please share the student's answer and I will evaluate it using these criteria, providing pass/fail scores and motivations in the requested JSON format.
# 
# # Question 17
# 
# ## Question
# 
# To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
# 
# ## Answer key
# 
# - Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
# - Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
# - Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
# - Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
# - Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.
# 
# ## Evaluation
# 
# I'm ready to evaluate the student's answer according to the specified format. Please share the student's answer and I will analyze it against the 5 key points, providing a JSON response with pass/fail grades and motivations for each component.
# 
# # Question 18
# 
# ## Question
# 
# We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
# 
# ## Answer key
# 
# - The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
# - The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
# - By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.
# 
# ## Evaluation
# 
# I am ready to evaluate a student answer based on the answer key you provided. The key elements I'll look for are:
# 
# 1. Definition of negativity bias
# 2. Definition of availability heuristic
# 3. Explanation of how these biases interact to affect perception of moral outrage
# 
# Please provide the student's answer and I will evaluate it using these criteria in the specified JSON format.
# 
# # Question 19
# 
# ## Question
# 
# One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
# 
# ## Answer key
# 
# - The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.
# 
# ## Evaluation
# 
# I'm ready to grade the student answer and provide scores and motivations in JSON format based on the given answer key. Please provide the student's answer and I'll evaluate it accordingly.
# 
# # Question 20
# 
# ## Question
# 
# What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
# 
# ## Answer key
# 
# - A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.
# 
# ## Evaluation
# 
# I'm ready to assess the student's answer according to the answer key once you provide it. I'll evaluate whether their response captures both key criteria:
# 
# 1. Irrational belief + not commonly accepted = delusional conspiracy theory
# 2. Otherwise = non-delusional conspiracy theory
# 
# I'll provide my assessment in JSON format with pass/fail scores and motivations for each element. Please share the student's answer when ready.
# 
# # Question 21
# 
# ## Question
# 
# During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
# 
# ## Answer key
# 
# - 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.
# 
# ## Evaluation
# 
# I'm ready to grade the student's answer based on the answer key provided. Please share the student's answer in your next message and I will evaluate it according to the format requested, providing pass/fail scores and motivations for at least three elements from the answer key.
# 
# # Question 22
# 
# ## Question
# 
# If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don‚Äôt know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
# 
# ## Answer key
# 
# - Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)
# 
# ## Evaluation
# 
# I'm ready to grade the student's answer based on the answer key provided. The answer key focuses on source amnesia, proactive interference, or the continued-influence effect as explanations. Please provide the student's answer and I will evaluate it using the specified JSON format, providing pass/fail assessments with motivations for each element.
# 
# # Question 23
# 
# ## Question
# 
# Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?
# 
# ## Answer key
# 
# - Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)
# 
# ## Evaluation
# 
# I'm ready to grade a student answer about mere exposure or the illusory-truth effect according to the answer key. I'll provide a JSON response with pass/fail scoring and brief motivations for the score. Please provide the student's answer.
# 
# # Question 24
# 
# ## Question
# 
# People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
# 
# ## Answer key
# 
# - No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.
# 
# ## Evaluation
# 
# I'm ready to evaluate the student's answer according to the answer key provided, judging whether they demonstrate understanding that:
# 
# 1) People with major depressive disorder are MORE accurate at making predictions
# 2) This is because they show less optimism bias compared to non-depressed people
# 
# I'll assess their answer and provide a JSON response with pass/fail scores and motivations for these two key points.
# 
# Please share the student's answer.
# 
# # Question 25
# 
# ## Question
# 
# In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
# 
# ## Answer key
# 
# - When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)
# 
# ## Evaluation
# 
# I'm ready to grade the student's response based on that answer key by evaluating whether they understand that decreased sensory reliability leads to increased influence of prior beliefs/expectations on perception. Please share the student's answer and I will provide a JSON response evaluating it against this single key point.
# 
# # Question 26
# 
# ## Question
# 
# According to Kohlberg, what are three levels of moral development? Very briefly describe each level. (Each level is sometimes split up into two stages. You don‚Äôt need to describe these stages.)
# 
# ## Answer key
# 
# - Pre-conventional Level: Focus on obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain rewards. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
# - Conventional Level: Focus on social norms and other people‚Äôs feelings. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
# - Post-conventional Level: Focus on abstract principles and values. (If the description is correct, the name of the level does not need to be mentioned.)
# 
# ## Evaluation
# 
# I'm ready to grade the student's answer about the developmental levels, focusing on whether they correctly describe each of the three levels (pre-conventional, conventional, and post-conventional), regardless of whether they name them specifically. I'll evaluate based on the key concepts: punishment/rewards, social norms/others' feelings, and abstract principles/values. Please provide the student's answer.
# 
# # Question 27
# 
# ## Question
# 
# What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?
# 
# ## Answer key
# 
# - A causal model is a coherent narrative of how past event are related
# - Events that are part of a causal model seems more inevitable than they were, thus contributing to hindsight bias
# 
# ## Evaluation
# 
# I'm ready to grade the student response based on the answer key. The expected format would include pass/fail evaluations and motivations for two key points:
# 
# 1. Definition of a causal model
# 2. Connection to hindsight bias
# 
# Please provide the student's answer and I will analyze it according to these criteria.
# 
# # Question 28
# 
# ## Question
# 
# How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
# 
# ## Answer key
# 
# - While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).
# 
# ## Evaluation
# 
# I'm ready to grade the student answer based on the answer key and provide my evaluation in the required JSON format. Please share the student's response.
# 
# The answer key suggests I should evaluate:
# 1. Whether they explain that you cannot avoid taking new information into account when estimating past likelihood judgments
# 2. While referencing the "curse of knowledge" concept is not required, the explanation should capture this cognitive bias
# 
# Please proceed with the student's answer.
# 
# # Question 29
# 
# ## Question
# 
# Briefly describe the maximizing and satisficing decision styles. If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, which decision style is he or she most likely to adopt?
# 
# ## Answer key
# 
# - Maximizing: trying to make the best choice
# - Satisficing: making a good-enough choice
# - If someone scores high on the neuroticism personality trait, he or she is most likely to adopt the maximizing decision style
# 
# ## Evaluation
# 
# I understand you want me to:
# 
# 1. Act as a professor grading a student response
# 2. Compare it against 3 key points:
#    - Defining maximizing
#    - Defining satisficing  
#    - Connection between neuroticism and maximizing
# 3. Provide a JSON response with pass/fail and motivation for each point
# 4. Wait for the student's answer before providing my evaluation
# 
# I'll await the student answer to provide my assessment in the requested JSON format.
# 
# # Question 30
# 
# ## Question
# 
# Imagine that you are teaching a university course with many students. You would like all the students to actively engage with the material. But you have only limited time and resources, which means for example that you cannot use forms of examination that require personalized (and thus time-intensive) feedback and grading. Based on the knowledge that you gained during this course, how would you approach this? (All answers that reflect serious engagement with this question will receive a point. Therefore, I suggest that you leave this question for the end!)
# 
# ## Answer key
# 
# - Any answer that reflects serious engagement with the question is considered correct.
# 
# ## Evaluation
# 
# I'll be ready to grade the student's answer based on the criteria you provided, following the format:
# 
# {
#   "grading": [
#     {

### Difficulty and discrimination of questions

Let's start with analyzing the difficulty and discrimination of the questions. This provides a mean score for each questions, and an RIR measure, which indicates how highly the score of a question correlates with the score on all other questions. Ideally, the mean score is about .7 and the RIR is a positive value of at least .2.

# # Question 1
# 
# ## Question
# 
# According to Jonathan Haidt‚Äôs social-intuitionist model of moral judgment, what is the role of System 1 and System 2 thinking in moral reasoning? And which System is most dominant according to this model?
# 
# ## Answer key
# 
# - System 1 thinking refers to the role of intuitions (or: emotion)
# - System 2 thinking refers to the role of reasoning (or: rational thought, or: deliberation)
# - System 1 thinking (or: intuition, or: emotion) is more dominant than System 2 thinking (or: reasoning; or: rational thought, or: deliberation).
# 
# ## Evaluation
# 
# No incorrect answers to evaluate
# 
# # Question 2
# 
# ## Question
# 
# Imagine that one of your colleagues from the lectures looks like a fashion model. Based on this observation, you assume that he or she probably is a fashion model. Which heuristic underlies this assumption? Briefly explain this heuristic.
# 
# ## Answer key
# 
# - The representativeness heuristic underlies this assumption.
# - The representativeness heuristic means that we estimate the likelihood of someone belonging to a category (such as that of a fashion model) based on how much that person resembles the stereotype from that category (a stereotypical fashion model).
# 
# ## Evaluation
# 
# No incorrect answers to evaluate
# 
# # Question 3
# 
# ## Question
# 
# What is anchoring, and what is the primacy effect? And what do they have in common?
# 
# ## Answer key
# 
# - Anchoring is the tendency to take the first piece of information as the starting point
# - The primacy effect is the tendency to better remember the first piece of information
# - Both have in common that they correspond to an overreliance on the first piece of information
# 
# ## Evaluation
# 
# No incorrect answers to evaluate
# 
# # Question 4
# 
# ## Question
# 
# What is the difference between loss aversion and risk aversion?
# 
# ## Answer key
# 
# - Loss aversion refers to the fact that we weigh losses more heavily than gains (or: the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over equivalent gains).
# - Risk aversion refers to the tendency that we prefer certainty over uncertainty.
# 
# ## Evaluation
# 
# No incorrect answers to evaluate
# 
# # Question 5
# 
# ## Question
# 
# What is impact bias? And how could impact bias prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship?
# 
# ## Answer key
# 
# - Impact bias is the tendency to overestimate the impact of future events on our future feelings.
# - Impact bias may prevent people from breaking up because they overestimate how bad the break-up will make them feel.
# 
# ## Evaluation
# 
# No incorrect answers to evaluate
# 
# # Question 6
# 
# ## Question
# 
# What is affective forecasting, and why is it important to consider it in end-of-life decisions?
# 
# ## Answer key
# 
# - Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional state.
# - Healthy people may predict that they will prefer to die when they get sick. But when they actually get sick, they may not actually prefer to die.
# 
# ## Evaluation
# 
# After reviewing the question, answer key, and incorrect student responses, I believe the answer key should be updated. Here's why:
# 
# The students are providing sophisticated and accurate explanations about affective forecasting and its relevance to end-of-life decisions, including important concepts like:
# - The tendency to underestimate our ability to adapt
# - The miscalculation of emotional intensity and duration
# - The gap between predicted and actual emotional responses
# - The impact on decision-making and values alignment
# 
# The current answer key is too narrow, focusing only on one specific example (healthy people predicting they'd prefer death when sick). While this is a valid example, it doesn't acknowledge other important aspects of affective forecasting in end-of-life decisions that the students correctly identified.
# 
# Recommendation for updated answer key:
# - Affective forecasting refers to predictions about our own future emotional states.
# - It is important in end-of-life decisions because:
#   1. People often underestimate their ability to adapt to difficult circumstances
#   2. There can be significant differences between predicted and actual emotional responses
#   3. This can lead to suboptimal decision-making about end-of-life care
#   4. For example, healthy people may predict they would prefer death when severely ill, but their actual preferences might change when facing illness
# 
# This broader answer key would better reflect the complexity of the concept while still maintaining the specific example from the original key.
# 
# # Question 7
# 
# ## Question
# 
# According to prospect theory, do people over- or underestimate low probabilities? And does this differ between merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) and extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%)?
# 
# ## Answer key
# 
# - Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
# - Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities.
# 
# ## Evaluation
# 
# After reviewing the question, answer key, and incorrect student responses, I notice a potential issue with the answer key that may have led to unfair scoring.
# 
# The distinction between "underestimation" and "treating as impossibilities" (as specified in the answer key) appears to be overly strict. Several students indicated that extremely low probabilities are "underestimated," which is essentially correct - treating something as impossible is arguably the ultimate form of underestimation. The current answer key seems to penalize students for using this reasonable terminology.
# 
# Moreover, there is one student response that captures this relationship particularly well: "people tend to overestimate low probabilities but underestimate extremely low probabilities." This answer demonstrates good understanding of the core concept, even though it doesn't use the exact phrasing "treated as impossibilities."
# 
# Recommendation for updating the answer key:
# I would suggest modifying the second point to accept both phrasings:
# - Merely low probabilities are often overestimated.
# - Extremely low probabilities are often interpreted as impossibilities OR are often underestimated/ignored.
# 
# This modification would more fairly assess student understanding while maintaining the key conceptual distinction between the treatment of merely low versus extremely low probabilities in prospect theory.
# 
# # Question 8
# 
# ## Question
# 
# When expressed in terms of utility in prospect theory, what does loss aversion reflect?
# 
# ## Answer key
# 
# - Loss aversion means that negative utilities are weighed more heavily than positive utilities. (Or: that the value function is steeper for losses than for gains.)
# 
# ## Evaluation
# 
# No incorrect answers to evaluate
# 
# # Question 9
# 
# ## Question
# 
# What are the two main differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory?
# 
# ## Answer key
# 
# - Expected value theory deals only with financial values, whereas expected utility also deals with non-financial values.
# - Expected value theory does not consider any heuristics and biases, whereas expected utility theory considers risk aversion.
# 
# ## Evaluation
# 
# After reviewing the question, answer key, and incorrect student responses, I believe the answer key should be updated. Here's why:
# 
# The student responses demonstrate a sophisticated understanding of the differences between expected value theory and expected utility theory, highlighting important technical distinctions that are not fully captured in the current answer key.
# 
# Specifically, the answer key's first point about "financial vs. non-financial values" is somewhat oversimplified. While it's true that expected utility theory can handle non-financial values, the more fundamental distinction is that expected value theory assumes risk neutrality and focuses on mathematical expectations, while expected utility theory incorporates subjective preferences and utilities.
# 
# I recommend updating the answer key to:
# 
# 1. Expected value theory assumes risk neutrality and focuses on mathematical expectations of outcomes (typically financial), whereas expected utility theory incorporates subjective preferences and can handle both financial and non-financial values.
# 
# 2. Expected value theory does not consider risk preferences, whereas expected utility theory accounts for risk attitudes (risk aversion, risk neutrality, or risk-seeking behavior).
# 
# This revised answer key would better reflect the technical distinctions between the two theories while still maintaining accessibility for students. It would also more fairly evaluate responses like those shown, which demonstrate accurate understanding of the fundamental differences between these theories.
# 
# # Question 10
# 
# ## Question
# 
# What are the four models of choice, value, and utility that we considered in the lecture? Very briefly explain each model.
# 
# ## Answer key
# 
# - Expected value theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has several of possible financial outcomes with a probability
# - Expected utility theory: just like expected value theory, except that outcomes have a utility that doesn‚Äôt need to be financial, but can also subjective
# - Multi-attribute utility theory: a normative model of choosing between different options. Each option has multiple attributes. Each attribute has a utility and a weight.
# - Prospect theory: a descriptive (behavioral) model of choosing between different options. This is similar to expected utility theory, but also considers heuristics and biases.
# 
# ## Evaluation
# 
# After reviewing the question, answer key, and incorrect student responses, I notice that many students seem to be consistently mixing up various decision-making theories and models that may have been covered elsewhere in the course, but weren't part of the specific four models mentioned in this lecture.
# 
# However, I don't see any evidence that students were unfairly penalized due to problems with the answer key. The answer key clearly specifies:
# 1. Expected value theory (with financial outcomes and probabilities)
# 2. Expected utility theory (similar but with subjective utilities)
# 3. Multi-attribute utility theory (multiple weighted attributes)
# 4. Prospect theory (behavioral model with heuristics and biases)
# 
# The answer key provides clear, distinct explanations for each model and the grading appears to have been consistent with these criteria. When students mentioned other theories (like Regret Theory, Dual Process Theory, etc.) or missed key aspects of the specified theories, they were appropriately marked incorrect.
# 
# Therefore, I conclude that the answer key is fine and no updates are needed. The key accurately reflects the four specific models that were covered in the lecture and provides sufficient detail to distinguish between correct and incorrect responses.
# 
# # Question 11
# 
# ## Question
# 
# How does loss aversion affect the degree to which people are risk averse?
# 
# ## Answer key
# 
# - People are willing to accept risk if this means that they can avoid a potential loss. In other words, loss aversion may decrease people‚Äôs tendency to be risk averse, and can even make people risk seeking.
# 
# ## Evaluation
# 
# After reviewing the question, answer key, and incorrect student responses, I don't find any issues with the answer key itself. The key correctly states that loss aversion can decrease risk aversion and even lead to risk-seeking behavior when people are trying to avoid losses.
# 
# What's interesting is that all the incorrect student responses make the exact same error - they claim that loss aversion increases risk aversion, when the opposite is true. This consistent pattern of incorrect responses might suggest that:
# 
# 1. This concept is counterintuitive for students and might need more emphasis in teaching
# 2. The course materials might need to be reviewed to ensure this relationship is clearly explained
# 3. The question itself might benefit from being more specific, perhaps asking students to explain why loss aversion can make people more willing to take risks in certain situations
# 
# However, these are teaching considerations rather than issues with the answer key itself. The answer key accurately captures the empirically documented phenomenon that people become more willing to take risks when facing potential losses, due to loss aversion.
# 
# The answer key is fine as it stands.
# 
# # Question 12
# 
# ## Question
# 
# What is conditioning? And what is the difference between classical and operant conditioning?
# 
# ## Answer key
# 
# - Conditioning is learning associations through covariation.
# - Classical conditioning: when two things tend to happen together in time and space, we learn to associate them.
# - Operant conditioning: learning that actions cause rewards or punishments.

# 
# # Question 13
# 
# ## Question
# 
# What is the difference between illusory causation and illusory correlation?
# 
# ## Answer key
# 
# - Illusory causation is when a correlation is incorrectly interpreted as a causal relationship, whereas illusory correlation is when a correlation is perceived between two variables that do not actually correlate.

# 
# # Question 14
# 
# ## Question
# 
# When people apply for Dutch nationality or a Dutch residence permit, they need to complete a test of Dutch culture as part of the so-called inburgeringsexamen. As part of this test, people are supposed to understand how the Dutch healthcare system works, and how to ‚Äòproperly‚Äô behave at a birthday party. Which of these two examples is a schema, and which is a script, and (briefly) why?
# 
# ## Answer key
# 
# - Understanding of the Dutch healthcare system is a schema, because it corresponds to knowledge and relationships between things
# - Knowing how to behave at a birthday party is a script, because it corresponds to a social schema that describes how you should behave in a specific situation

# 
# # Question 15
# 
# ## Question
# 
# Behaviorism was an approach to psychology, mainly popular in the early 20th century, that emphasized that the mind could not be measured, and that psychologists should therefore focus on how stimuli trigger behavior. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet‚Äôs stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance did behaviorists adopt, and (briefly) why?
# 
# ## Answer key
# 
# - Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior.
# 
# ## Evaluation
# 
# Based on my review of the question, answer key, and incorrect student responses, the answer key itself is accurate but could benefit from a small expansion to help better distinguish why behaviorists adopted the physical stance rather than other stances.
# 
# Many students seem to have confused the intentional stance with the physical stance, perhaps because both can involve predicting behavior. The key difference is that the intentional stance involves attributing mental states (beliefs, desires, intentions) to predict behavior, while the physical stance focuses purely on physical cause-and-effect relationships - which is exactly what behaviorists did.
# 
# I recommend expanding the answer key slightly to:
# 
# "Behaviorists adopted the physical stance, because they focused on the direct physical processes that caused a stimulus to result in a behavior, explicitly rejecting any consideration of mental states or intentions. This aligns with the physical stance's focus on pure cause-and-effect relationships."
# 
# This expanded version would help make clearer why the physical stance (and not the intentional or design stance) is the correct answer, while maintaining the core accuracy of the original answer key.
# 
# This is particularly important since the student responses show a pattern of understanding behaviorism's rejection of mental states but not understanding how this maps to Dennett's stances.
# 
# # Question 16
# 
# ## Question
# 
# Evolutionary psychology, sometimes also called functionalism, is an approach to psychology that considers psychological processes from the perspective of their usefulness in evolutionary terms. For example, ingroup favoritism (our tendency to prefer people from our own group) would be beneficial because it stimulates the emergence of protective communities. If you think of this in terms of Daniel Dennet‚Äôs stances (or: levels of analysis), which stance do evolutionary psychologists adopt, and (briefly) why?
# 
# ## Answer key
# 
# - Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function.
# 
# ## Evaluation
# 
# Based on my review of the question, answer key, and incorrect student responses, I notice a consistent pattern where students are choosing the "intentional stance" instead of the "design stance," but their explanations often accurately describe the evolutionary psychology approach in terms of analyzing functions, purposes, and adaptive value.
# 
# The answer key is technically correct, but I believe it could be improved to help students better distinguish between the intentional stance and design stance. Many students seem to confuse "purpose" and "function" with intentionality.
# 
# Recommended update to the answer key:
# 
# - Evolutionary psychologists adopt the design stance, because they consider psychological processes in terms of their function or "design purpose" - how these processes were shaped by natural selection to solve specific adaptive problems. This differs from the intentional stance, which would treat psychological processes as rational agents with beliefs and desires.
# 
# This expanded answer key would help clarify why function-based analysis aligns with the design stance rather than the intentional stance, addressing the common misconception seen in the student responses.
# 
# The distinction between analyzing something's function (design stance) versus treating something as a rational agent with beliefs and desires (intentional stance) appears to be the key point of confusion that needs to be clarified.
# 
# # Question 17
# 
# ## Question
# 
# To judge whether event A causes event B, or merely correlates with event B, we make use of five heuristics, as described in the lecture. What are these heuristics? Provide a very brief explanation of each.
# 
# ## Answer key
# 
# - Distinctness (or: specificity). A likely causes B, when B follows A, but does not follow other events.
# - Consistency. A likely causes B, when B always follows A.
# - Plausibility. A likely causes B, when common sense makes it plausible that A causes B.
# - Contiguity in time and space. A likely causes B, when A and B occur at the same time and in the same location.
# - Similarity in cause and effect. A likely causes B when A and B superficially resemble each other.
# 
# ## Evaluation
# 
# After reviewing the question, answer key, and incorrect student responses, I notice a significant pattern that suggests potential issues with the answer key. Multiple students consistently provided certain alternative answers that might deserve consideration:
# 
# 1. Almost all students mentioned "temporal precedence" as a heuristic. While the answer key emphasizes "distinctness/specificity," the temporal aspect (A preceding B) seems to be an important component that students learned but isn't explicitly acknowledged in the key.
# 
# 2. Many students used the term "covariation" instead of "consistency." While the answer key marks this as incorrect, covariation and consistency are closely related concepts in causal reasoning, and the students' explanations often captured the essential idea of A and B reliably occurring together.
# 
# 3. Several students mentioned experimental manipulation and elimination of alternative explanations. While these weren't in the answer key, their frequent appearance suggests they might have been discussed in the lecture or course materials.
# 
# Recommendation for updating the answer key:
# 
# 1. Consider expanding the "distinctness/specificity" criterion to explicitly include temporal precedence, as this seems to be a key component students learned.
# 
# 2. Consider accepting "covariation" as an alternative term for "consistency" when the explanation demonstrates understanding of the reliable relationship between A and B.
# 
# 3. If experimental manipulation and elimination of alternative explanations were indeed covered in the lecture, consider clarifying why these aren't among the five key heuristics, or update the lecture materials to more clearly specify which five heuristics students should focus on.
# 
# These changes would help align the answer key more closely with what appears to be the students' shared understanding from the lecture while maintaining the rigor of the assessment.
# 
# # Question 18
# 
# ## Question
# 
# We tend to overestimate how many people are morally outraged based on what we see on social media. Which two biases primarily contribute to this?
# 
# ## Answer key
# 
# - The negativity bias is the tendency to seek out, or place more weight on, negative information, such as morally outraged content.
# - The availability heuristic is the tendency to estimate the frequency or probability of something based on the ease with which examples or associations come to mind.
# - By causing us to attend to morally outraged content, the negativity bias increases examples of moral outrage, which through the availability heuristic causes us to overestimate how many people are morally outraged.
# 
# ## Evaluation
# 
# After reviewing the question, answer key, and incorrect student responses, I can confirm that the answer key appears to be fair and appropriate. Here's why:
# 
# 1. The answer key clearly identifies the two correct biases (negativity bias and availability heuristic) and explains their roles individually.
# 
# 2. The answer key appropriately emphasizes the interaction between these two biases, explaining how the negativity bias feeds into the availability heuristic to create the overestimation effect.
# 
# 3. The pattern in incorrect student responses shows that:
#    - Most students correctly identified the availability heuristic
#    - Students commonly substituted other concepts (false consensus effect, spotlight effect, echo chamber effect) for the negativity bias
#    - Few students explained the interaction between the two biases
# 
# This pattern suggests that the question effectively discriminates between complete and incomplete understanding of the concept. The incorrect answers demonstrate that students who didn't fully understand the material tended to:
# - Remember only one of the two correct biases
# - Substitute related but incorrect concepts
# - Miss the important interaction between the two biases
# 
# Therefore, I conclude that the answer key is fine and does not need to be updated. It accurately captures the essential elements needed for a complete understanding of how these biases contribute to overestimating moral outrage on social media.
# 
# # Question 19
# 
# ## Question
# 
# One form of magical contagion is when you prefer not to use things that used to belong to someone that you profoundly dislike. How can you explain this in terms of framework theories for different domains of knowledge?
# 
# ## Answer key
# 
# - The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social (or: psychological, or: cultural) domain.
# 
# ## Evaluation
# 
# After reviewing the question, answer key, and incorrect student responses, I believe the answer key should be expanded. While it correctly identifies the core concept (inappropriate application of biological domain concepts to social/psychological domains), there are two issues:
# 
# 1. The answer key is too narrow, potentially leading to unfair scoring. Many students demonstrated understanding of the phenomenon through related concepts (psychological essentialism, sympathetic magic, etc.) but may have missed points simply for not explicitly stating the domain crossing.
# 
# 2. The answer key doesn't clearly specify what would constitute a complete answer.
# 
# Recommended updated answer key:
# 
# Main points (student should address at least the first point and one additional point for full credit):
# - Primary insight: The concept of contagion from the biological domain is incorrectly applied to the social/psychological/cultural domain
# - Supporting explanation: This represents a case of domain crossing where understanding from one knowledge framework (biological contamination) is inappropriately extended to another domain
# - Relevant related concepts that may be included: psychological essentialism, sympathetic magic, or magical thinking as frameworks that help explain why humans make this domain crossing error
# 
# This expanded answer key would better accommodate thoughtful responses that approach the question from slightly different but valid theoretical angles while still maintaining the core requirement of understanding the framework theory perspective about domain crossing.
# 
# # Question 20
# 
# ## Question
# 
# What distinguishes a delusional conspiracy theory from a non-delusional conspiracy theory?
# 
# ## Answer key
# 
# - A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory.
# 
# ## Evaluation
# 
# After reviewing the question, answer key, and incorrect student responses, I believe there may be an issue with the answer key that deserves attention.
# 
# The answer key states that "A conspiracy theory is delusional when it is both an irrational belief and not commonly accepted. Otherwise it is a non-delusional conspiracy theory."
# 
# This definition is potentially problematic for several reasons:
# 
# 1. Common acceptance is not necessarily a good criterion for determining whether a conspiracy theory is delusional. Historically, there have been cases where irrational conspiracy theories became widely accepted in certain populations, but this widespread acceptance didn't make them less delusional.
# 
# 2. Many of the student responses focused on more substantive criteria like evidence, logical reasoning, and openness to contrary evidence. These seem like more relevant factors for distinguishing delusional from non-delusional thinking.
# 
# Recommendation for updating the answer key:
# I would suggest revising the answer key to focus more on epistemological criteria rather than social acceptance. A possible revision could be:
# 
# "A conspiracy theory is delusional when it:
# - Lacks credible supporting evidence
# - Resists falsification/is immune to contrary evidence
# - Relies on irrational or illogical reasoning
# - Often involves implausible claims requiring extraordinary evidence
# 
# A non-delusional conspiracy theory, by contrast, is characterized by:
# - Being supported by credible evidence
# - Being open to falsification
# - Following logical reasoning principles
# - Making claims that could be plausibly true given available evidence"
# 
# This revised version would better align with both academic understanding of delusions and with the thoughtful criteria many students identified in their responses.
# 
# # Question 21
# 
# ## Question
# 
# During the lecture, we reviewed several cognitive and personality factors that contribute to conspiratorial thinking. Can you name three of these factors?
# 
# ## Answer key
# 
# - 3:Should mention at least three of the following: seeing patterns in randomness; believing paranormal phenomena; attributing agency where it does not exist; believing in simple explanations for complex events; being narcissistic; being a man; having a low level of intelligence; having a low level of analytical thinking.

# # Question 22
# 
# ## Question
# 
# If you quiz yourself while preparing for an exam, you are likely to give incorrect answers when you don‚Äôt know the material very well yet. And then you learn by seeing the correct answer. Through which psychological mechanism can these incorrect answers interfere with learning?
# 
# ## Answer key
# 
# - Through source amnesia you may forget that the answer you provided was in fact incorrect, and mistake it for the correct answer. (Alternative answers: Proactive interference can cause the initial incorrect answer to interfere with the later correct answer. The continued-influence effect may be used as a general term referring to this phenomenon.)
# 
# ## Evaluation
# 
# After reviewing the question, answer key, and incorrect student responses, I notice a potentially significant issue. Many students consistently answered with "retrieval-induced forgetting," which, while incorrect according to the answer key, appears to be a reasonable alternative explanation for how incorrect answers during self-testing might interfere with learning.
# 
# The pattern in student responses suggests that either:
# 1. The course material may have emphasized retrieval-induced forgetting in a way that made it seem applicable to this scenario, or
# 2. The question itself may not have been specific enough to guide students toward thinking about source amnesia rather than other memory interference mechanisms.
# 
# Recommendation for updating the answer key:
# I would recommend expanding the answer key to either:
# a) Explicitly address why retrieval-induced forgetting is not an appropriate answer in this context, or
# b) Include retrieval-induced forgetting as an additional acceptable answer, if it can indeed explain the interference of incorrect answers with learning.
# 
# Additionally, the question itself might benefit from being more specific about the particular aspect of interference being asked about - perhaps by explicitly mentioning the confusion between correct and incorrect answers rather than just general interference with learning.
# 
# This would help differentiate between source amnesia (forgetting whether an answer was correct or incorrect) and retrieval-induced forgetting (difficulty retrieving correct information due to practicing incorrect information), which are both plausible mechanisms for interference in learning but operate in different ways.
# 
# # Question 23
# 
# ## Question
# 
# Politicians often keep repeating the same statements over and over again. In addition to the availability heuristic, through which psychological mechanism do they hope to make their message more attractive by frequently repeating it?

# - Mere exposure, which is the tendency to prefer things that we are familiar with. (Alternative answer: the illusory-truth effect.)

# # Question 24
# 
# ## Question
# 
# People often make predictions about how likely it is that something bad will happen to them. Does major depressive disorder make people less accurate at making such predictions?
# 
# ## Answer key
# 
# - No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions, because they show a reduced tendency to be overly optimistic.
# 
# ## Evaluation
# 
# After reviewing the question, answer key, and incorrect student responses, I believe the answer key could be improved. Here's why:
# 
# The current answer key states the core finding correctly (that people with major depressive disorder are more accurate at making such predictions), but it could be more precise about terminology. Several students mentioned "depressive realism," which is indeed the technical term for this phenomenon, yet this term isn't included in the answer key.
# 
# Additionally, many students seem confused about the relationship between "negative bias" and "accuracy." The answer key could be clearer about the fact that non-depressed people typically show an "optimism bias" (overestimating positive outcomes/underestimating negative ones), and that the increased accuracy in depressed individuals comes from the absence of this optimism bias, rather than from a negative bias per se.
# 
# Recommended update to the answer key:
# 
# "No, people with major depressive disorder (as compared to non-depressed people) are more accurate at making such predictions. This phenomenon, known as 'depressive realism,' occurs because depressed individuals show a reduced optimism bias compared to non-depressed people, who tend to underestimate the likelihood of negative events. While depressed individuals may appear more negative in their predictions, their estimates are actually more realistic."
# 
# This updated version would help avoid confusion about the relationship between negative thinking and accuracy, while also incorporating the relevant technical term.
# 
# # Question 25
# 
# ## Question
# 
# In the ideal-observer model of perceptual decision making, prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to create a perception. That is, what you perceive is a combination of what you expect and the information that reaches your senses. What happens to the influence of prior beliefs on perception when the reliability of sensory information decreases?
# 
# ## Answer key
# 
# - When the reliability of sensory information decreases, perception is increasingly affected by prior beliefs. (Or: what you perceive is increasingly a matter of what you expect when the information that reaches your senses is unreliable.)

# # Question 27
# 
# ## Question
# 
# What is a causal model (of past events), and how does it contribute to hindsight bias?

# # Question 28
# 
# ## Question
# 
# How does learning contribute to hindsight bias?
# 
# ## Answer key
# 
# - While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge (this term does not need to be provided).
# 
# ## Evaluation
# 
# After reviewing the question, answer key, and incorrect student responses, I believe the answer key should be expanded. While the current key captures an essential mechanism of how learning contributes to hindsight bias (the inability to ignore new information when making retrospective judgments), the student responses reveal some additional valid points about the relationship between learning and hindsight bias.
# 
# Recommended update to the answer key:
# 
# - While estimating past likelihood judgments, you cannot avoid taking newly learned information into account. This is also referred to as the curse of knowledge.
# - Learning provides additional causal understanding and explanatory frameworks that make past outcomes seem more predictable than they actually were at the time.
# - As people acquire new knowledge, they tend to overestimate their ability to have anticipated outcomes based on the information that was actually available at the time.
# 
# Rationale: The student responses demonstrate understanding of important aspects of how learning contributes to hindsight bias, even if they missed the specific mechanism highlighted in the original answer key. The expanded answer key would better capture the multiple ways in which learning influences hindsight bias while still maintaining the core concept from the original key.
# 
# This would allow for partial credit for responses that correctly identify some, but not all, of the mechanisms through which learning contributes to hindsight bias.
