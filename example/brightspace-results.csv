"According to Haidt's social-intuitionist model, moral judgments are primarily driven by automatic, intuitive processes (System 1) rather than conscious, deliberative reasoning (System 2), with System 1 playing a dominant role in moral decision-making, while System 2 often acts as a post-hoc rationalization of the intuitive judgments produced by System 1.",System 1 and 2 thinking and social intuitionism,40be4d34cdfe43458f7986951475fe86
"The heuristic underlying this assumption is the representativeness heuristic, where individuals make judgments based on how well a particular case represents or resembles a broader category or stereotype, in this case, the stereotype of a fashion model. This cognitive shortcut allows for quick decision-making, but it can also lead to biases and errors in judgment, as appearances do not necessarily reflect the full reality of a person's occupation or background.",Like a fashion model,40be4d34cdfe43458f7986951475fe86
"Anchoring is a cognitive bias where an individual's decision or estimate is influenced by an initial piece of information or ""anchor."" The primacy effect is a psychological phenomenon where individuals tend to remember and be influenced by the first piece of information they receive in a sequence. Both anchoring and the primacy effect demonstrate how initial information can disproportionately impact judgment and decision-making.",Anchoring and primacy,40be4d34cdfe43458f7986951475fe86
"Loss aversion refers to the tendency of people to strongly prefer avoiding losses over acquiring equivalent gains, while risk aversion is the general preference for safer, less variable outcomes over riskier, more variable ones.",Loss and risk aversion,40be4d34cdfe43458f7986951475fe86
"Impact bias is the tendency for people to overestimate the impact that future events will have on their emotions. This can prevent people from breaking up, even when they are unhappy in their relationship, as they may fear the negative emotional impact that the breakup will have on them, causing them to stay in an unsatisfying relationship.",Impact bias,40be4d34cdfe43458f7986951475fe86
Affective forecasting is the ability to predict one's future emotional states and reactions. It is important to consider in end-of-life decisions because people often underestimate the resilience of their emotional well-being and may make choices that don't align with their actual preferences once they experience the situation.,Affective forecasting,40be4d34cdfe43458f7986951475fe86
"According to prospect theory, people tend to overestimate low probabilities, but this effect is more pronounced for extremely low probabilities (e.g. 0.01%) compared to merely low probabilities (e.g. 10%) due to the curvature of the probability weighting function.",Prospect theory and probabilities,40be4d34cdfe43458f7986951475fe86

"Expected value theory focuses on maximizing the mathematical expectation of a random variable, while expected utility theory takes into account the decision-maker's risk preferences and aims to maximize the expected utility of a gamble; expected value theory assumes the decision-maker is risk-neutral, whereas expected utility theory allows for risk-averse or risk-seeking behavior.",Value and utility,40be4d34cdfe43458f7986951475fe86
The four models are: (1) Expected Utility Theory - individuals make choices to maximize expected utility (a weighted average of utilities of possible outcomes); (2) Prospect Theory - individuals are loss averse and overweight small probabilities; (3) Regret Theory - individuals consider the regret they would feel if they made a different choice; (4) Ambiguity Aversion - individuals prefer options with known probabilities over options with unknown probabilities.,"Models of choice, value, and utility",40be4d34cdfe43458f7986951475fe86
"Loss aversion, the tendency to strongly prefer avoiding losses over acquiring gains, leads people to be more risk averse as they typically weigh potential losses more heavily than potential gains of the same magnitude when making decisions. This heightened sensitivity to losses makes people less willing to take risks that could result in losses, even if those risks also offer the possibility of larger gains. Consequently, loss aversion increases the degree of risk aversion exhibited by individuals.",Risk aversion,40be4d34cdfe43458f7986951475fe86
"Conditioning is the process of learning through association, where a stimulus (such as a bell) is paired with a response (such as salivation).

"The two biases that primarily contribute to overestimating moral outrage on social media are the availability heuristic, where we tend to judge the frequency of an event based on how easily it comes to mind, and the false consensus effect, where we tend to overestimate the extent to which others share our beliefs and opinions.",Moral outrage,40be4d34cdfe43458f7986951475fe86
"This preference can be explained through the framework theory of psychological essentialism, which suggests that people tend to attribute inherent, underlying properties or ""essences"" to objects and entities. In the case of magical contagion, the dislike for the previous owner is believed to have ""contaminated"" the object, leading to an aversion to using it. This phenomenon can also be understood through the framework theory of folkbiology, which posits that people have intuitive beliefs about the biological world, including the idea that certain properties can be transmitted through physical contact.",Magical contagion,40be4d34cdfe43458f7986951475fe86

"Major depressive disorder can distort people's perceptions of risk, leading them to overestimate the likelihood of negative events occurring, a phenomenon known as depressive realism. However, research on the topic has produced mixed results, with some studies suggesting that individuals with depression may be more accurate in their risk assessments compared to those without the disorder.",Major depressive disorder,40be4d34cdfe43458f7986951475fe86
"In the ideal-observer model, as the reliability of sensory information decreases, the influence of prior beliefs on perception increases, meaning that perception becomes more dominated by one's expectations rather than the current sensory input.",Ideal observers,40be4d34cdfe43458f7986951475fe86
"According to Kohlberg, the three levels of moral development are: Preconventional (focus on self-interest and obedience to authority), Conventional (conformity to social norms and expectations), and Postconventional (principled moral reasoning based on universal ethical principles). Each level represents an increasing complexity in moral reasoning and decision-making.",Kohlberg’s stages,40be4d34cdfe43458f7986951475fe86
"A causal model is a mental representation of how different factors or events are causally linked, often used to make sense of past occurrences. Hindsight bias refers to the tendency to overestimate the predictability of past events once the outcome is known; a causal model can contribute to this bias by making the outcome seem more inevitable or obvious in retrospect, even if it was not easily predictable beforehand.",Hindsight bias and causal models,40be4d34cdfe43458f7986951475fe86
"Learning can contribute to hindsight bias by allowing individuals to better understand and make sense of past events, leading them to believe that the outcome was more predictable than it actually was.

"The maximizing decision style involves exhaustively searching for the best possible option, while the satisficing decision style involves selecting the first option that meets a person's minimum criteria.

"To encourage active engagement in a university course with limited time and resources, I would focus on fostering collaborative learning through group discussions, peer-to-peer feedback, and project-based assignments that allow students to apply course concepts to real-world problems; I would also incorporate low-stakes formative assessments, such as quizzes and reflective exercises, to provide students with regular feedback and opportunities to monitor their own learning progress without requiring extensive grading from the instructor.",Incentives,40be4d34cdfe43458f7986951475fe86
"According to Jonathan Haidt's social-intuitionist model, System 1 (intuitive) thinking plays a dominant role in moral reasoning, where moral judgments are primarily driven by rapid, automatic, and emotion-based intuitions, while System 2 (reflective) thinking serves a secondary role in providing post-hoc justifications for those intuitions.
