Decision styles,GPT 4o,"Maximizing decision style involves seeking the best possible outcome by considering all available options thoroughly, often leading to longer decision-making times and higher levels of indecision. Satisficing decision style, on the other hand, involves settling for a decision that meets the minimum criteria or threshold of acceptability, which can result in quicker and less stressful decision-making. Individuals who score high on the neuroticism personality trait are more likely to adopt a maximizing decision style because they tend to worry more about making the wrong decision and thus seek the best possible outcome."
Moral outrage,GPT 4o,"The tendency to overestimate moral outrage on social media is primarily influenced by the availability bias and the confirmation bias. Availability bias occurs when people judge the frequency or likelihood of an event by the ease with which examples come to mind, and social media often amplifies extreme cases of outrage. Confirmation bias leads people to favor information aligning with their existing beliefs, reinforcing the idea that moral outrage is more widespread than it actually is."
Factors contribution to conspiracy theory,GPT 4o,"Three cognitive and personality factors contributing to conspiratorial thinking include a need for closure, paranoia, and pattern recognition. Individuals who have a high need for closure are uncomfortable with ambiguity and may gravitate towards conspiracies as they offer simple, comprehensive explanations. Paranoid individuals are more likely to see hidden threats and deceptions in the world around them. Those with heightened pattern recognition skills may detect patterns and connections in unconnected events, leading them to identify conspiracies where none exist."
