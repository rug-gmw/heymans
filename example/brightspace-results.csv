"First, I would consider what matters most to me by predicting the value and weighing its benefits and risks. I want active participation, but since I don’t have the capacity to personally provide feedback or answer every question, I’d need to implement systems that encourage engagement while fitting my limited availability. I’d likely incorporate peer feedback, where students review each other's work, helping them deepen their understanding and gain diverse insights. It’s also crucial to ensure students actually participate by asking questions, providing feedback, and completing assignments. Motivation should involve both rewards and potential losses, as benefits alone often aren’t enough; for example, using grades, pass/fail statuses, extra credit, or additional exam attempts. I might include an optional “opinion question” that factors into grading or pass/fail, prompting students to formulate and support their views, which encourages engagement through critical thinking. If time permits, organized debates could be an enjoyable addition to classes or assignments. Having used many of these methods myself, I believe the key is choosing strategies you genuinely care about and have thoughtfully prepared. Virtually any tool or incentive can work if it effectively motivates students; understanding their motivations and life circumstances is essential for making decisions. Exams could then involve multiple choice, short answers, or AI grading, since much of the learning would already be demonstrated during class and assignments.
