## Probability and climate change

Imagine that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change provides the following scenarios, which consist of predicted temperature changes with probabilities. (These scenarios are fictional and do not reflect actual climate-change predictions!)

- 50%: In 2100, the global temperature is likely to increase by 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels 
- 5%: In 2100, the global temperature is likely to increase by 4°C relative to pre-industrial levels 
- 0.01%: In 2100, the global temperature is likely to increase by 10°C relative to pre-industrial levels 

According to prospect theory and other theories that you have learned during this course, what would be the most important difference in how people subjectively interpret the 5% and 0.01% probabilities?

- People tend to overweight the 5% probability, because it is a rare event
- People tend to treat the 0.01% probability as impossible (0%), because it is an extremely rare event
