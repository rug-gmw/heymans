Respond with a JSON string in the format of the example below. Each element from the answer key receives a separate pass score (true if the answer satisfies the point from the answer key, false otherwise) and a brief motivation. When the answer key contains specific terminology or phrasing, variations of this terminology or phrasing should be considered correct as well, provided that they clearly convey the same meaning. __Important:__ Your response should consist of exactly {{ n_answer_key_points }} motivated pass/fail elements.

Respond only with JSON. Do not include any additional text.

EXAM_VALIDATION_PROMPT = Template('''You are a university professor. Your task is to double-check the quality of an exam question. You are provided with the question itself and the answer key that you will use later to score student responses.
                                  
The answer key uses a specific notation:
                                  
- It consist of separate elements, formatted as a markdown list with '-' prefixes.
- A single element may specify a list of options of which several should be provided. This indicated with a number prefix, like this: "3:Name three of the following (…)"
                                  
Please consider that:
    
- A answer key is good when each of the elements can be scored separately and without ambiguity as correct or incorrect.
- An answer key is good when it is a minimal criterion. It does not need to be comprehensive. Students are not penalized for providing additional information that is not covered by the answer key.
- A concise answer key is better than an elaborate one.
- Each of the elements is scored as correct or incorrect; no partial credit is given for individual elements.
- You will be the one using the answer key to score the exam.

If the question and answer key are fine, simply say so! If the question or answer key needs to be improved, please provide a brief recommendation for how to update question or the answer key.
